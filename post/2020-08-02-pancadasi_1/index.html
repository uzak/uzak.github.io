Artha, kama, dharma one cat get through a proxy. Not moksha. First three can be attained by karma. Moksha only through jnanam.</li><li>Everything in the three periods of time but you exists conditionally.</li><li>Three obstacles: 1) lack of preparedness 2) obstacle pertaining to the interpretation of the sastra itself (different schools) 3) logical problems.</li><li>Ad 1) If I give less value to the attainment of moskha, then I am deficient in qualification. The greater the spiritual hunger the greater sadhana chatustaya sampati. No worry, listening to scriptures sadhana chatustaya sampati grows.</li><li>Ad 3) Vedanta: What is never experience and still there is the reality and what is experienced all the time is not the reality. How come?</li><li>Conviction: knowledge free from doubts.</li><li>Prasthana traya (basic texts): Gita (smruti), Upanishads (shruti), Brahma Sutra (yukti or nyaya).</li><li>Texts to remove interpretional and logical doubts are called Prakarana grantas. One of the popular is Pancadasi.</li><li>Pancadasi because 15 chapters.</li></ul><h1 id=02-chapter-1-1---2>02: Chapter 1: 1 - 2</h1><ul><li><strong>Subject matter of the scriptures: jiva brahma aikyam.</strong></li><li>What I love is my nature. Existence, happiness, survival, knowledge. Independence. What I don&rsquo;t love is not my nature.</li><li>Pada comes from padayati/pAdayati - makes us reach the destination. Feet cause us to reach the destination. Shankaracharya is called Bhagavatpada.</li><li>Sastra wants to make you free from the notions regarding you.</li><li>Distance between me and brahman is in terms of ignorance.</li><li>Mahamoha - ignorance of the limitless.</li><li><strong>Being free from the hold of raga-dvesha is all that is required. You can keep them. You cannot be free from them completely.</strong></li><li>To acquire qualification there is thousands of way. Karmayoga. Once qualified, there is one to get the knowledge. Jnanayoga.</li><li><strong>Jnanam itself is moksha.</strong> There is no time involved between jnanam and moksha &ldquo;happening&rdquo;.</li></ul><h1 id=03-chapter-1-3---4>03: Chapter 1: 3 - 4</h1><ul><li>Tatvajnanam: jiva brahma aikyam. Essence of the teaching.</li><li>Plurality of external objects is proven through internal plurality of experiences. Each experience, even though is seems like one, consists of thought and consciousness. Thought appears, gets associated with consciousness and becomes perception. Both are needed for experience, like electricity and bulb for it to shine. Thus diversity of perception is due to diversity of thoughts.</li><li>Waking state experiences, cognitions, are called vishesha jnanam. Consciousness common in all existent at all times is called samanya jnanam.</li><li>Thoughts arrive and go. Consciousness is all the time there.</li><li>In sushupti (deep sleep) two things are experienced: anandavrti (sukham - I slept well) and ajnanavrti (ignorance).</li><li><strong>I love myself unconditionally. I love every other thing in the creation conditionally. Anything which you love conditionally is not your nature - because there is a condition.</strong></li><li>Object of the unconditional love (myself) is a source of joy. Cit = Ananda. Unconditional means all the time there. Cit = Existence.</li><li>How to separate consciousness from thoughts in experiences? Through discriminative analysis. There is no question of physical separation - nothing is basically separated from consciousness.</li><li><ol><li>consciousness is not part, product nor a property of a thought.</li></ol></li><li><ol start=2><li>consciousness is an independent principle which pervades every thought and turns in into experience.</li></ol></li><li><ol start=3><li>consciousness is not limited by the boundaries of the thought. Thought is located, consciousness is not.</li></ol></li><li><ol start=4><li>consciousness continues to exist even when all thoughts resolve. Absence of the thoughts is revealed by the consciousness.</li></ol></li><li><ol start=5><li>consciousness is not available for transaction in absence of thought.</li></ol></li><li>In waking state objects are long-lasting (due to outside objects made of pancha bhutas), in swapna objects are momentary because they are made of thoughts only.</li></ul><h1 id=04-chapter-1-5-6-7>04: Chapter 1: 5, 6, 7</h1><ul><li><strong>There are for things in every avasta: object of perception, thought, perception, consciousness.</strong> In dream state the objects are made just of thoughts.</li><li>If perception doesn&rsquo;t work, make use of inference.</li><li><strong>Perception (=experience) is made up of thought and consciousness.</strong></li><li><strong>If memory is there, I must have undergone an experience. Based on memory of the deep sleep state, I can say that in sushupti I experience tamaha (ignorance) or ananda. As subtle body is absent, this vrti takes place in the karana sharira.</strong></li><li>Whatever is unmanifested you take as absent. Whatever is unmanifested you&rsquo;ll not be able to experience. Like butter in yogurt. <strong>Only after you wake up (during waking state) the experience of ignorance gets realised in the form of thought.</strong></li><li>Object of memory is identical with the object of past experience. Anubhava gives rise to smrti.</li><li>Every perception has name and form. Remove intellectually and what remains is the one consciousness.</li><li>Names and forms are called upadi(s).</li><li>Conscious is used as adjective (depending on a substantive) in the language - corresponds to the view of the science that consciousness is attribute of the brain.</li><li>Electricity needs a bulb for expression. It doesn&rsquo;t need a bulb for existence. It&rsquo;s independent.</li><li>What is unmanifested you&rsquo;ll not be able to experience, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it is not there. Like butter in the jogurt.</li><li>For expression in the form of life the consciousness needs a body and a mind. But not for its existence.</li><li>Everything else needs consciousness to be proven, consciousness does not - it is self proven.</li><li>What is self-revealing is self-existent.</li><li>Existence is always proved by knowability and to know you require consciousness.</li><li>Anavasta dosha - infinite regression - would happen if consciousness would need something else to prove it.</li><li>You don&rsquo;t need nobody else to know that you are and that you know.</li><li>If consciousness can prove itself there would be a problem. The prover and the proven must be different.</li></ul><h1 id=05-chapter-1-5-6-7>05: Chapter 1: 5, 6, 7</h1><ul><li>Thoughts are innert in nature. They need consciousness in order to be converted into experience.</li><li>Because of mulaavidya (upadi of brahman, maya, shakti, avyaktrtam, avyaktam) alone brahman is called jiva. It is the cause and therefore not available for direct experience, only the product is experiencable. What you experience in the waking state is called tulaavidia. That&rsquo;s ignorance pertaining to the world.</li><li>In the sleep the object of the thought is tamaha (=mulaavidya).</li><li><strong>Innert things cannot experience anything. Because you have experience in deep sleep (of ignorance and bliss) it proves consciousness is there.</strong></li><li>Shunyam (nothingness, zero) of Buddhists - total nothingness. Vedantic nothingness (mulaavidya) is infinite and is the cause of entire creation. Cause of everything in potential state.</li><li>In potential form you cannot find any differences and therefore it is called avyakrtam. All names and forms come to unmanifested and therefore it is called avyaktam.</li><li>Scientist are attempting to study consciousness as matter (as part, property or product), not as a distinct principle. That&rsquo;s why it is not available for scientific study, which can examine only energy (abstract form) or (concrete form) of matter.</li><li>I use the same &ldquo;I&rdquo; as adult and as child even though the bodies are totally different. That proves that &ldquo;I&rdquo; is something different from the body.</li><li><strong>To say &ldquo;time begins&rdquo; you need already some time.</strong></li><li>Universe will be always made of five elements in every srsti. So the objects of experience will match the karmas from previous srsti.</li><li><strong>If the medium of reflection is absent you will not be able to say if light is there or not. Same for consciousness.</strong></li><li>Life has to do with prana. Life has nothing to do with consciousness. It is a product of maya and mithya. Consciousness is just present all the time. <strong>Arrival of life is not arrival of consciousness but an expression of it (which requires a conducive medium of a subtly body for manifestation).</strong></li><li>Consciousness is one. Plurality belongs to the forms.</li><li><strong>What is self-revealing is self-existent and requires no proof of its existence. Like sun.</strong> Like you not needing anybody to tell you whether you are in the class or not. To prove your existence you should already be existent.</li><li>Light of lights. Ear of ears, eye of eyes, prana of prana &mldr;</li><li><strong>Once anything becomes becomes an objects of consciousness it becomes/is automatically inert. If a consciousness needs another consciousness to be revealed the first one becomes (is) inert.</strong></li></ul><h1 id=06-chapter-1-verse-8>06: Chapter 1 Verse 8</h1><ul><li>What is temporary, is not my nature.</li><li><strong>Recognition is connecting of past and now/future. You need to remove the incidental features. Same for body and atma.</strong> I&rsquo;m the consciousness with incidental body, sense organs, mind, prana, intellect, karma&mldr;</li><li>Who you are should be your understanding. For transactional purposes use the &ldquo;I&rdquo; you had before the knowledge.</li><li>Wherever there is object of love it is the source of the joy. <strong>Atma is the object of love for everyone, thus it is the source of ananda. Shown in everyone taking care of himself/herself very much.</strong></li><li>Love for the self is instinctive and universal.</li><li><strong>Your whole activity is centered around the care of yourself.</strong></li><li><strong>Suicide: his intention is not to end his life, his desire is to end the suffering. And she/he sees no hope.</strong></li><li>Atma is the only source of joy.</li></ul><h1 id=07-chapter-1-verse-8-9-10>07: Chapter 1 Verse 8, 9, 10</h1><ul><li><strong>A changing thing cannot be the intrinsic nature of a thing.</strong> What is incidental comes and goes. Heat in water vs. heat in fire.</li><li><strong>Body/mind is not intrinsic to the &ldquo;I&rdquo;. That we see in the analysis of the three states.</strong> Jiva is intrinsically satchitananda.</li><li><strong>Logic means inference.</strong></li><li>Quality of love towards an object is of different quality than the love to the self. <strong>Love towards an object is based on conditions. No one loves any person nor any objects nor god unconditionally. Only the love of self is unconditional. It is instinctive (we&rsquo;re born with this, animals as well - manifestation: resistance slaughterhouse). It is universal.</strong></li><li>One never want to get rid of the self, only of problems/suffering.</li><li><strong>Conditional love is as good as no love. You don&rsquo;t love the person (or object), you love the condition.</strong> Atma is the source of greatest joy as there is no condition involved.</li><li>Vedanta: You should be able to arrive logically at what the shruti says. Sanhyas, Vayshyeshikas, Nayayikas give up shurti when their logical conclusions (tarka) contradict shruti.</li><li>Puja Swami: Whatever has parts will fall apart. It is anitya.</li><li>Vedanta: Akasha has also parts, because shruti says so. You will not be able to arrive at the nature of yourself using logic only. By yukti (reasoning) you arrive at the conclusion that jivatma is paramatma. To know that Isvara is paramatma you need shruti. So basically they are one and the same.</li></ul><h1 id=08-chapter-1-verse-11---14>08: Chapter 1 Verse 11 - 14</h1><ul><li>Charasteristic of samsara: attachment (ragah), sorrow (shokah), delusion (mohah). That is the suffering caused due to ignorance. Life itself becomes a kind of prison due to ignorance. That&rsquo;s why Upanishads teach us.</li><li>Both total ignorance and total knowledge are a bliss and no problem. Partial knowledge about oneself is a problem. Example: rope-snake.</li><li><strong>Samsara: sense of individuality</strong>, sense of limitation, sense of discomfort. See oneself as karta, bhokta, victim of prarabda, etc. Leads to hurt and guilt.</li><li>Habitual looking into shining surfaces to see oneself demonstrates self-love.</li><li><strong>Daily I go and search for objects that give me happiness - that shows my ignorance.</strong></li><li>This knowledge you gain in the buddhi.</li><li>Partial knowledge is a problem. Many voices in the chorus prevent the father from recognising his son&rsquo;s chanting (<strong>partial knowledge prevents discrimination</strong>).</li><li><strong>A wise man loves the world for the sake of the world. He loves unconditionally - knowing that everything is me. A samsari loves the world for the sake of himself.</strong></li><li>Jnani identifies with everyone. He sees himself everywhere.</li><li>Evident = experienced (= known).</li><li>Light is the one which enables to see the hand. But you are taking notice only of the hand - it as though covers the light, even though the light is more pervasive. <strong>Experiencing the light most people miss the light, because they focus only on the hand.</strong></li><li>The very cloud &ldquo;covering&rdquo; the sun is seen doe to the sun. It cannot cover the sun, yet it can cover out vision of the sun. It brings it out of your focus. Like in cinema we are so engrossed in the movie that we miss the screen and scream. (&ldquo;En-grossed&rdquo; that&rsquo;s why missing the &ldquo;light&rdquo;).</li><li>Mulaavidiya is called karanaavidya. Tulaavidia is called karyaavidya.</li></ul><h1 id=09-chapter-1-verse-15>09: Chapter 1 Verse 15</h1><ul><li><strong>If atma is totally unknown to you, there will not be self-love. If it is totally known to you that atma alone is source of joy why should you have logging for a sense object?</strong> Attachment towards the world indicates that you are not fully aware that you are the source of joy.</li><li><strong>An inert object is one which is incapable of revealing itself. It always needs a conscious being for that. It is not self-existent (because not self-revealing), thus it is mithya.</strong></li><li>When did ignorance join the ever-blissful atma? Anadi. This is the one answer meaning &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask&rdquo;. If somebody asks further - we say anirvachaniya - it cannot be categorised (as sat/asat), mithya.</li><li>Vishistadvaiti book: Satadushani - 100 defects of Vedanta. Vedantins say those are 100 ornaments.</li><li>The only job of avidya: damage the person. It joins you in each life and creates samsara. Karta -> actions -> &mldr;</li><li>Words are meant to reveal the objects.</li><li>Before creation there is Purusha (Brahman) and Prakrti (Maya). Brahman has no desire, no power, no knowledge to create. Prakrti is mithya thus cannot be counted. Example: There is me and my reflection, how many are there? Thus advaita.</li><li><strong>Brahman associated with sattvapradanaprakti (=Maya) becomes nimittakaranam. Associated with tamahpradanaprakrti becomes upadanakaranam. Brahman becomes creator through association. Satya-mithya sambandha. No relationship, as relationship needs two equals.</strong></li><li>We don&rsquo;t have any relation with anybody. Neither with the body, neither with my senses, neither with my mind. Neither with the world, neither with any person, neither with any object.</li><li><strong>Brahman associated with rajapradanaprakrti becomes jiva.</strong> Total sattva or total ignorance - no problem. Intermediate thing - Brahman associated with avidya saying I&rsquo;m jiva = samsara. <strong>There are many shades of rajapradanaprakrti therefore there are many jivas.</strong></li><li>Brahman associated with sattvapradanaprakti becomes jnani. That&rsquo;s why they tell you to increase your sattva and decrease rajas and tamas. More sattva means more knowledge, more clarity.</li><li>Rajoguna - action function. Sattva - knowledge function. Tamas - suppression of both action and knowledge function.</li></ul><h1 id=10-chapter-1-verse-16---19-creation>10: Chapter 1 Verse 16 - 19: Creation</h1><ul><li>Prakrti doesn&rsquo;t poses the three gunas. They are not its attributes. They are Prakrti.</li><li>Vishudha sattva is Maya. With Brahman reflected in that it is called Isvara. Malina sattva is rajapradanaprakrti is avidya. Brahman reflected here is called Jivah.</li><li>Isvara is swami, Jiva a dasa. Iswara is a master of Maya, Jiva is a slave of avidya.</li><li>Iswara: Brahman + reflected consciousness (pratibimba) + Maya (sattvapradanaprakti) + tamahpradanaprakrti. Jiva: Brahman + avidya + reflection.</li><li>Vicitram = variated. Many kinds of karanashariras thus jivas are there. Jiva = pragnaha. We are prepared for creation now (creator and creature is there). Ishvara will provide another two bodies and objects to experience sukham/dukham.</li><li>tamahpradanaprakrti means predominance of tamas, not exclusivity.</li><li>Maya is not a product of Brahman. Both are anadi. Brahman reflected in the Maya or avidya is also anadi. All (Maya, ajnanam, Iswara, Jiva) except for Brahman have an end, thus are mithya.</li><li>Iswara is the adiguru and he initiates the brahmavidya. He&rsquo;s got no ignorance. Jiva has partial knowledge (he knows only that I&rsquo;m) but this leads to misconception which in turn to samsara.</li><li>Isvara is like the spider of Mundakaupanishad. Both nimittakaranam and upadanakaranam for the whole creation. From upadanakaranam he creates five elements &mldr; <strong>By the will of god (depending on jivas&rsquo; karma), not by the fancy - that would mean raga and dvesha.</strong> Otherwise there would be no order (action -> result experiences the same one).</li><li>Srshti is cyclic, not linear. There is no beginning and no end. Moksha is going out of the srshti cycle, once the merry-go-round becomes sorry-go-round.</li></ul><h1 id=11-chapter-1-verse-20---26>11: Chapter 1 Verse 20 - 26</h1><ul><li><strong>One antahkarana has two names based on the function: mind and intellect. Mind decides something (=sankalpa) and then immediately a question/doubt arises (=vikalpa). Mind decides and there is no doubt against it - buddhi.</strong> Like one person is called manager and householder.</li><li>Intelligent creation: if you see a pot, it is intelligent creation. A conscious being must be involved - nimittakarana.

We&rsquo;re just questioning their utility for Moksha.</li><li><strong>Vedanta analyses experiences but is not in search of new and extraordinary ones.</strong> The three states of experience are enough for us to arrive at the knowledge of the self and gain moksha.</li><li><strong>Niddidhiasanam: (vedantic) meditation is meant to assimilate teaching received through sravanam. Goal: emotional issues gone</strong>.</li><li><strong>All emotional issues are habitual.</strong> So consciously remove the subconscious notions through niddidhiasanam.</li><li>Moksha = emotional soundness. Samsara: emotional issues.</li><li><strong>You&rsquo;re ready for niddidhiasanam when you&rsquo;re convinced that you&rsquo;ve doubtless knowledge</strong>.</li><li>Niddidhiasanam is of two types: <strong>1) constant alertness to every situation during waking state so that the response is based in keeping with the teaching,</strong> (BG 5.8-9: <em>pasyan srvnam sprsan &mldr; naiva kincit karomiti yukto manyete tattva-vit</em>) <strong>2) BG 6: you sit and spend time exclusively with a specific deeper issue</strong> that makes you suffer a lot.</li><li>vicikitsa = samshaya = doubt.</li><li>Mananam: deals with the <strong>basic doubt &ldquo;How can I be Brahman?&rdquo;</strong>. Not some minor doubts like are there 17 or 19 parts of sukshma sharira etc.</li><li>We&rsquo;re taking only the last three steps from Yogashastra. Dharanam - fixing the mind, letting the thought centered, on the Self, I. Ekathanatvam (dhyayam) - concentration. Having fixed, retain the flow of thoughts on the Self. Samadhi.</li><li><strong>Mithya = non separate (from the real).</strong></li><li><strong>Just drop the notions about yourself and you&rsquo;ll be left with what&rsquo;s reality about you. Never think &ldquo;my mind will illumine&rdquo;.</strong> The mind will basically drop the notions.</li></ul><h1 id=26-chapter-1-55>26: Chapter 1: 55</h1><ul><li>Vedantic meditation (niddidhiasanam) = fixing the mind on Brahman -> dropping the wrong notion pertaining to the self. Example: What &ldquo;I&rdquo; is it that fears? The body/mind one. The real &ldquo;I&rdquo; is fearless.</li><li>Keep consciously dissimilar thoughts (=pertaining to anatma) away.</li><li>Not repetition &ldquo;aham asangah&rdquo; all over. <strong>We&rsquo;re not particular about entertaining the same thought. But on similar thoughts pertaining to atma.</strong></li><li>Pick a few words like ananda, nityam, suddham, buddham, muktam, asangam, advitiyam and write few lines about them and ponder about it.</li><li>You don&rsquo;t require to sit for more than 15 minutes. 2-3x a day is good.</li><li><strong>Other various types of niddidhiasanam: keep listening again and again, discussion with someone else, sharing - teaching.</strong></li><li><strong>Vedantic samadhi is possible consequence of niddidhiasanam. It means absorption and is normal, natural faculty of every mind. Has nothing to do with mysticism.</strong></li><li>When you start thinking in a given line, mind can gradually absorb in that thing. <strong>Generally we&rsquo;re absorbed in our own worries. Here the object of absorption is the self.</strong></li><li>Samadhi = Total absorption (<strong>&ldquo;being in flow&rdquo;</strong>) with the object of meditation. Not the yogic &ldquo;no thought&rdquo; state, which is very similar to deep-sleep state.</li><li>If any kind of experience which removes self-ignorance (gives knowledge) is of benefit to us.</li><li>Autobiografy - all notions regarding the person&mldr; Remove notions to reveal the self.</li><li><strong>Anything you gain in the life, you will not be free from suffering.</strong> You have to knock off the notion I&rsquo;m not samsari. For reaching one&rsquo;s own abode, one&rsquo;s own home, comfort, there is no way. No marga.</li><li>Yogis - in the process of destroying the mind. Ashtanga yoga is ultimately to kill the mind. Vedanta says mind is required.</li><li>Yogic samadhi won&rsquo;t give jnanam, nor will remove obstacles. Removing obstacles requires thinking. Resolving the mind is escapism from realism of life, not facing, resolving the problem.</li><li>Yogic samadhi - jada samadhi. Avidya vrtti is there. Experience is not knowledge.</li><li><strong>Vedantic samadhi is like paddling the cycle. Initially will (=effort) is required, but then those thoughts remain in the mind by sheer habit. Without will based effort.</strong> Will means ahamkara is involved.</li><li>Vedantic samadhi: I&rsquo;m right now dwelling on that, that kind of awareness is not there. Just similar thoughts pertaining to the self - the teaching - remain. Very effort of retaining is not there.</li></ul><h1 id=27-chapter-1-56---58>27: Chapter 1: 56 - 58</h1><ul><li><strong>Effort is always based on the will. And will is based on the meditator. Drop the will and only object of meditation in which you&rsquo;re absorbed remains. That is vedantic nirvikalpa samadhi.</strong> Like reading a book you love. You don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re a reader reading a book.</li><li>Even in nirvikalpaka samadhi vrttis are there. Yet their presence is not recognized because ahamkara does not function. <strong>When ahamkara is dormant and a vrtti raises it is called sukshma vrtti.</strong> Knower is not present. If he is, it is sthula vrtti.</li><li>In shusupti knowledge regarding to ignorance (tamovrtti, avidyavrtti) is there. You have memory of sleeping well, but not during the experience because the knower is sleeping.</li><li>Every memory is born out of experience. It is the proof thereof.</li><li>In yogic samadhi avidyavrtti are there.</li><li><strong>Self-forgetfulness is the biggest problem of every seeker.</strong> Generally the problem is not absorption, but retention. Solution: just continue niddidhiasanam.</li><li><strong>Our job is to drop all wrong notions pertaining to the self.</strong></li><li>Sandal = pair. Raga dvesha = pair. Once you wear sandals &mldr;</li><li><strong>Teaching should go to subconscious.</strong> Then you need not worry, it is always with you. Because in conscious mind only few things remain (5 entries, a lot of input and traffic) and go.</li><li>Bashyakara: In every janma acquire more and more of these samskaras pertaining to atma. You require initially conscious effort (a lot of) and then it becomes samskara. At this stage <strong>reduce worldly activity</strong>. Don&rsquo;t engage too much in the world. This is why Jagnyavalkya has retired - to assimilate what he already knew.</li><li>This is a serious affair, yet nothing to be worried about. It is very time consuming. Every day until death, until you go to sleep entertain thoughts regarding to the self.</li><li><strong>Constantly generate punyam. Pancha maha yagnyas. Have religious life. And constantly form vedantic habits through niddidhiasanam.</strong> Be like a flame in a breezeless room, let not the mind go into anatma.</li><li><strong>Job and phalam of niddidhiasanam: bring everything out of subconscious mind. Certain thoughts might arise because of old habits, but you will be in charge of those because of niddidhiasanam.</strong></li><li>Samadhi is a possible consequence but not a must. Like reading a book. You dn&rsquo;t understand it only when you are totally absorbed in that.</li><li>A true character of a person can be only known by studying him in a provocative situation. Then subconscious personality comes into play, conscious one is overpowered.</li><li>We don&rsquo;t give importance to formal meditation. But to being emerged in the teaching.</li><li><strong>What is contrary to experience (anubhava), logic (yukti), sastra (sruti) we have to negate.</strong> Be careful around yogic sastras. For them samadhi is the pinacle, sravanam least important. Vedanta gives most importance to sravanam, mananam and niddidhiasanam.</li></ul><h1 id=28-chapter-1-verse-59---62>28: Chapter 1: Verse 59 - 62</h1><ul><li>glorification of samadhi by yoga sastra:<ol><li>samadhi destroys all sanchita karmas.</li><li>samadhi increases shudha punya karma. Any karma will cause punya and some papam as well. Even puja as we might not do it flawlessly. By samadhi punyam only will increase by huge amount, no papam.</li><li>samadhi dissolves all viparita bhavana - all emotional issues.</li><li>samadhi uprootes the tree of karma. Destroys the ignorance (root) and all sanchita karmas.</li><li>mahavakya becomes free of all obstacles and becomes capable of doing its job - giving aparoksha jnanam.</li></ol></li><li>Vedantic standpoint:<ol><li>We don&rsquo;t accept. Knowledge, not samadhi destroys sanchita karmas.</li><li>We don&rsquo;t accept. Punyam is result of karma.</li><li>Totally acceptably. <strong>Emotional freedom is the main benefit of samadhi.</strong></li><li>and 5. Not acceptable. Only jnanam destroys punya papam. This is beautifully said in Mundakopanishad. Samadhi is state where no new knowledge is generated.</li></ol></li><li>immediate knowledge - <strong>aparoksha jnanam = that brahman is myself -> mukti</strong>. Only mahavakya gives that. That&rsquo;s the tatparyam of all upanishads.</li><li><strong>When aparoksha jnanam is there in the intellect along with obstacles (emotional, intellectual) then we call it paroksha jnanam. Paroksha jnanam doesn&rsquo;t give mukti.</strong></li><li>Sravanam gives knowledge, mananam removes intellectual obstacles, niddidhiasanam emotional ones.</li><li>Getting angry, jealous etc. in a situation is a habit. <strong>All emotional issues are habitual errors that have the basis in taking the body mind as oneself.</strong></li><li>Pratibhandas don&rsquo;t go in one day. If you&rsquo;re waiting for some kind of incident that resolves all obstacles - that day will never come. <strong>Removing obstacles is growing clarity. It&rsquo;s a process, not a momentary event.</strong> Otherwise we&rsquo;ll wait for something special to happen. This is a gradual process like braking the day. Or just like studying at the college - clarity grows slowly.</li><li>Create more and more space in understanding that I&rsquo;m not the body/mind.</li></ul><h1 id=29-chapter-1-63---65>29: Chapter 1: 63 - 65</h1><ul><li>Paroksha jnanam will eliminate all the papa karmas of the sishya. Student&rsquo;s ahamkara and mamakara are greatly reduces because he knows these are false identification with the body.</li><li>Interpretional obstacles give birth to new philosophies.</li><li>What is a relationship between pot and clay? Mirage water and desert? Body and self? <strong>Sathya-mithya relationship is no relationship.</strong></li><li><strong>Paroksha jnanam will eliminate agami papam. You will not not do deliberately do any papa-karma.</strong></li><li>Until you get some maturity in your niddidhiasanam follow your sadhana chatustaya champati. So it will be your second nature and you are spontaneously dharmic. Deliberate papa karma is impossible. For what? There is no kama in his heart that compels.</li><li>If a person sees everything as himself where is the desire? You don&rsquo;t have a desire for what you are but for something other than you&mldr;</li><li>Atma reveals its own existence. Light of lights - jotisham joti.</li><li><strong>What is not self-evident and self-existent is mithya. And it should not be counted. Therefore there is one entity in the creation.</strong></li><li><strong>Apratibandhaka aparoksha jnanam</strong> (claming &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free here and now&rdquo;). It <strong>gives you jivan-mukti.</strong> Thus one will not have punar janma. Subtle body was given to you to learn what you are, once you know, there will be no purpose.</li></ul><h2 id=qa>Q&A</h2><ul><li><strong>in vyavahara the reflected consciousness is involved but your nature is witness consciousness.</strong> I&rsquo;m not waker - reflected consciousness, I&rsquo;m witness of the waker. Waker is the direct meaning of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; - vachyarta. Lakshyarta is witness consciousness. Let the citabhasa do the vyavahara, but know (think) that your real nature, the real &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the witness consciousness.</li><li>I&rsquo;m conscious of the body, the body is not conscious of myself. The two are distinct.</li><li>Jiva - individual - includes the body in the word &ldquo;I&rdquo;. <strong>Step 1: understanding I&rsquo;m consciousness (through bhaga tyaga; atma anatma viveka). Step 2: understanding that that consciousness is limitless through mahavakya</strong>.</li><li>Experience is always in the form of the vrtti, impression of the mind. Depending on the presence of the knower (ahamkara), it will be a sukshma or sthula vrtti.</li><li><strong>Sarvam kalvidam brahman. All names and forms (creation) are brahman. But brahman is not names and forms (creation).</strong> Water can exist without being a wave, but wave cannot exist without water. Beggar is actor, actor is not beggar at all.</li><li>Both deep sleep and yogic samadhi give experience of non-dual state. But samadhi-one can be described afterwards. <strong>Experience of non-duality is not knowledge of non-duality</strong>. People coming out of samadhi don&rsquo;t know after it that whatever they experience is mithya. Their ajnanam continues. <strong>Experience of non-duality is not a good teacher thereof</strong>. What is needed is the understanding.</li></ul></article></div><section class=article-navigation><p><a class=link href=/post/2020-10-12-pancadasi_2/><span class=li></span>Pancadasi - Chapter 2</a></p><p><a class=link href=/post/2020-07-26-vivekachudamani_sp_2020/><span class=li></span>Vivekachudamani Swami Paramarthananda 2020</a class="link"></p></section><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=uzak/uzak.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOGkA1Jg data-category=Q&A data-category-id=DIC_kwDOGkA1Js4CO1WV data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-theme=light data-lang=en-US crossorigin=anonymous async></script></section><script charset=utf-8>window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",()=>{const e=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{const t=e.target.getAttribute("id");e.intersectionRatio>0?document.querySelector(`nav li a[href="#${t}"]`).parentElement.classList.add("active"):document.querySelector(`nav li a[href="#${t}"]`).parentElement.classList.remove("active")})});document.querySelectorAll("h2[id]").forEach(t=>{e.observe(t)})})</script><aside class=toc><details open><summary class=toc-title>Table of Contents</summary><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#qa>Q&A</a></li></ul></nav></details></aside><section id=footer class="footer max-body-width"><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>©2022 Martin Uzak</p></div><div class=footer-wrap><a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh target=_blank rel=noopener>CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a><span> | </span><a href=/index.xml target=_blank rel=noopener>RSS</a></div><div class=footer-wrap><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://github.com/qdzhang/hugo-notepadium-mod target=_blank rel=noopener>Notepadium-mod</a></p></div><div class=footer-wrap><a onclick='window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"smooth"})'>^ TOP ^</a></div></section></div></body></html>
