Doing things enables people to learn, not theory (reading/seeing).</li><li>Lessons from your own experience stick with you best.</li><li>The balcony is the place from which you can <strong>step back and observe.</strong> So that you can get back on the floor and make your next move.</li><li><strong>In leadership, the most common sources of problem are diagnostics. If you get the problem wrong, generally the action will be wrong.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=a-definition-of-leadership>A definition of Leadership</h3><ul><li>In any group of people, <strong>we only need leadership when we face challenges.</strong></li><li><strong>People mistake the personal abilities, the hands or the tools as the essence of leadership, rather than the work to be done.</strong></li><li><strong>Nobody has ever come with a key characteristics of a leader.</strong></li><li>Leadership is critical because we do face challenges in our lives.</li><li>How do you mobilize people to get the important work to get done?</li><li>Think of leadership like the craft of carpentry. Good hands and tools don&rsquo;t define carpentry. Building something does. Challenges do.</li><li>Most common source of confusion about leadership is thinking about it as a set of abilities and tools.</li><li><strong>Leadership - practice of mobilizing people to meet though challenges.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=identify-the-work-to-be-done>Identify the work to be done</h2><h3 id=technical-problems>Technical Problems</h3><ul><li>Routine. Easy to solve.</li><li>Not necessarily simple, but the know-how and systems are ready to go.</li><li>Not determined by complexity or its importance, but the degree to which the challenge already lies within our capacity to solve.</li><li><strong>Today&rsquo;s technical problems were yesterday&rsquo;s adaptive challenges.</strong></li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t really need leadership, need people to do their job.</strong></li><li><strong>Require only authoritative and sometimes managerial expertise.</strong></li><li>Leadership and Authority: You don&rsquo;t need leadership if you&rsquo;re just doing what you know how to do already.</li></ul><h3 id=adaptive-challenges>Adaptive Challenges</h3><ul><li>Gap we don&rsquo;t know yet how to close. <strong>Gaps between our aspirations and reality.</strong></li><li><strong>Requires developing a new capability.</strong></li><li><strong>Unlike in all other places in nature, our adaptive challenges are not only produced by external forces.</strong></li><li>Pain. Novelty. Uncertainty about what we might lose in the process.</li><li>People love change when it is a good thing. What people resit is the losses that sometimes accompany change.</li><li><strong>Leadership requires deep understanding for the pains of change.</strong></li><li>What to give up and what innovations will enable us to take the best from our history into the future.</li></ul><h3 id=leadership-through-adaptive-work>Leadership through Adaptive Work</h3><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t believe a persuasive visionary leader can step in and solve adaptive challenges people are facing.</li><li><strong>Know-how is yet to be developed</strong> and has to reside in the hears of minds of the people who are living the solution.</li><li>Leadership, as the term is used in this course, is the <strong>practice of adaptive work.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=why-do-we-misdiagnose>Why Do We Misdiagnose?</h3><ul><li>Success of leadership depends on your ability to distinguish challenges that are technical (requiring authority, management) vs. that are adaptive .</li><li>Tendency to apply technical solutions to adaptive challenges -> low implementation rates of good ideas. E.g. recommending diet and exercise to patients and they don&rsquo;t comply.</li></ul><h3 id=authority-and-misdiagnosis>Authority and Misdiagnosis</h3><ul><li>Authority impedes diagnostic capability. Expectations of people create an <strong>enormous pressure on people to provide answers rather than raise tough questions.</strong></li><li><strong>With adaptive problems you cannot take the problem of people&rsquo;s shoulders. People themselves are part of the problem and thus solution.</strong></li><li>The more distress, the stronger the yearning for authorities to know the way.</li><li><strong>2nd problem of misdiagnosis is personal. Ability to solve problems is part of the identity of &ldquo;experts</strong>&rdquo;.</li><li>Often best you can do is to:<ul><li>frame up the right questions</li><li>identify the key realities that need to be addressed</li><li>challenge people to take responsibility for tackling the problems</li></ul></li><li><strong>We all take pride in knowing rather than not.</strong></li><li>Being able to step back and go to the balcony and notice when and how you&rsquo;re being pushed to see the challenge as a technical problem is crucial skill in providing effective leadership.</li></ul><h3 id=unbundling-the-work>Unbundling the Work</h3><ul><li><strong>Most problems come bundled.</strong></li><li>If we treat bundled problems as if it were only technical, we&rsquo;re going to neglect critical parts of the problem and won&rsquo;t really meet the challenge.</li><li>Once diagnosed, how would you begin to mobilize people to develop that capacity.</li><li>I don&rsquo;t know is a good place to start. It&rsquo;s difficult to be able to say so.</li></ul><h2 id=lead-with-beyond-and-without-authority>Lead With, Beyond and Without Authority</h2><h3 id=nature-of-authority>Nature of Authority</h3><ul><li><strong>How would you disappoint people at a rate they can stand?</strong></li><li><strong>If people expect you to know, but you&rsquo;re saying we don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;re part of the problem.</strong></li><li><strong>Social system implies authority structures and authority relationships.</strong></li><li>Not all crude power is authority.</li><li>We&rsquo;re willingly giving a person authority, personal power. Often by habit. Often not a conscious choice.</li><li><strong>Power ultimately comes from the people who do the authorizing.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=roots-of-authority>Roots of Authority</h3><ul><li><strong>Trusting others to provide us with services is the basic of social living.</strong></li><li>Authority is relational. You cannot have authority by yourself. You cannot authorize yourself. You can give yourself permission. You only have authority when others give you authority.</li><li>Hope that trustworthy people will be found worthy of our authorization.</li></ul><h3 id=services-of-authority-direction-protection-and-order>Services of Authority: Direction, Protection and Order</h3><ul><li><strong>Every authority relationship will to some degree provide direction, protection and order.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=authority-and-leadership>Authority and Leadership</h3><ul><li><strong>Common source of confusion is equating leadership with authority.</strong> If we do it clouds our thinking and blurs key aspects of both.</li></ul><h3 id=formal-authority>Formal Authority</h3><ul><li>Power entrusted as part of a job, title, or official role</li><li>Reporting relationship - someone senior to check and guide your work.</li><li>An organization is a system of formal authorization from top-to-bottom and from side-to-side living in a larger society of authorizations.</li></ul><h3 id=informal-authority>Informal Authority</h3><ul><li>When people have informal authority we look to them with broader admiration and respect beyond the specific trust to get a job done.</li><li>In our daily lives, many of our authorizations are informal.</li></ul><h3 id=changes-to-authority-over-time>Changes to Authority Over Time</h3><ul><li>Informal authority is enormously valuable.</li><li><strong>Formal authority often isn&rsquo;t enough.</strong></li><li><strong>Informal authority comes often with a subtle, yet quite substantial power.</strong></li><li>Over time informal authority can turn into greater formal authority.</li><li>In practice you need to track how your informal ability, your credibility, respect, approval and admiration change in people&rsquo;s eyes.</li><li>Election campaigns are all about getting enough informal authority to win.</li><li>Formal authority is mostly changeless and informal is in a flux.</li><li>Often formal and informal authority come with power that works most effectively when when used complementary.</li></ul><h3 id=advantages-of-leading-beyond-and-without-authority>Advantages of Leading Beyond and Without Authority</h3><ul><li><strong>One can lead without any authority.</strong></li><li>Often there are advantages to this way of leading.</li><li>Many people spend years of lives waiting to get to an authority position where they can finally start to lead and waste many leadership opportunities in the process.</li><li>Many unsung heroes lead every day just because they care.</li></ul><h2 id=take-action-think-politically>Take Action: Think politically</h2><h3 id=stakeholder-map>Stakeholder Map</h3><ul><li>Organizational Chart</li><li>Swim-Lane Diagram. Each role gets a column</li><li>Stakeholder Map. Dinner/<strong>round table</strong> analogy. The work is the meal. Factions are visualized like fingers. It&rsquo;s an iterative process. Each faction has <strong>values, potential loses, loyalties.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=take-action-build-trust>Take Action: Build Trust</h2><ul><li>Trust is the pivot point</li><li><strong>In an authority relationship we have &ldquo;power&rdquo; on one side and &ldquo;services&rdquo; on the other.</strong></li><li>Components of Trust:<ul><li><strong>values</strong> - heart at the right place</li><li><strong>competence</strong></li></ul></li><li>We&rsquo;re born into this world. Totally dependent and naturally trusting.</li></ul><h3 id=maladaptive-dependence>Maladaptive Dependence</h3><ul><li><strong>when people have too little faith in themselves, or too much trust in others</strong>. Particularly in desperate times.</li><li>Sometimes we never break out of the habit and realize <strong>that we&rsquo;re the source of a person&rsquo;s authoritative powers.</strong></li><li><strong>Sometimes we&rsquo;ve learned to accept too little from our authority figures.</strong></li><li>Rousseau: Authority figures are the agents of the citizens, even in a monarchy.</li></ul><h3 id=counter-dependence-and-independence>Counter-Dependence and Independence</h3><ul><li><strong>Counter-Dependence - reacting to whomever speaks with an authoritative voice with a reflexive &ldquo;no&rdquo;, no matter what they say.</strong></li><li><strong>Result of repeated experience of disappointed dependence.</strong></li><li>Independent, you&rsquo;re grounded in yourself and free to respond deliberately to people, no matter what comes at you.</li><li>With independence, you&rsquo;re open to interdependence with other, healthy dependencies in both directions.</li><li>Erosion of trust in authority is a serious problem in our social lives.</li><li>It&rsquo;s one thing to be cautious, but imagine if you couldn&rsquo;t trust anyone what you expect of them.</li><li><strong>Lifelong policy of trust will certainly hurt you. Lifelong policy of distrust will hurt you even more.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=disappointing-expectations>Disappointing Expectations</h3><ul><li>Be honest and real and speak about the lessons you&rsquo;ve learned.</li><li>Reset the unrealistic expectations you&rsquo;ve set up.</li><li>Each occasion to reset trust in an opportunity to prepare people to accept uncertainty and move with greater adaptability to other issues.</li><li>It&rsquo;s important to respect how quickly people can absorb tough messages.</li></ul><h3 id=reshaping-expectations>Reshaping Expectations</h3><ul><li>abuse begets abuse</li><li><strong>you should not try to meet unreasonable expectations</strong></li><li><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to be perfect. Being honest with others about difficulties you encounter can be just as powerful.</strong></li><li>Maintain focus on the context, remind others of the what and why.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t conceal or diminish losses.</li><li>Meet anger with patience and understanding.</li><li>Stay close to the opposition.</li><li>Listen</li></ul><h2 id=take-action-orchestrate-conflict>Take Action: Orchestrate Conflict</h2><ul><li>Reactions to conflict:<ol><li>Inaction as action. Systems often reward inaction - keeping status quo.</li><li>Appeal to authority</li><li>Fight or flight</li></ol></li><li>Those who exercise leadership must orchestrate conflict within an organizational system to generate dynamism and innovative ideas. Creative tension.</li></ul><h3 id=a-process-for-mobilizing-learning>A Process for Mobilizing Learning</h3><ul><li>Prepare before bringing factions together. Do you understand them? What will they lose? What changes need to occur?</li><li>Gather all views.</li><li><strong>Create, share and enforce ground rules. Help depersonalize the process and keep the work at center.</strong> Ground rules need to be established early.</li><li>Orchestrate conflict.</li><li>Promote honesty about loses</li><li>Experiment. Generate multiple experiments to test out potential solutions.</li><li>Harness the power of peer consulting.</li></ul><h2 id=recognizing-common-pattern>Recognizing Common Pattern</h2><ul><li>Disequilibrium - state of disruption in an organizational system.</li><li>Technical work can generate lots of disequilibrium and be slow to decrease, depending on the severity and complexity of the problem.</li><li><strong>Most organizations ale allergic to conflict.</strong></li><li><strong>Yet conflict is the engine of innovation.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=increase-the-heat>Increase the Heat</h3><ul><li><strong>Productive range</strong> of stress. If you keep the heat to low, nothing will cook. If you heat up too high, people won&rsquo;t be able to tolerate.</li><li>Bounds: <strong>threshold of learning</strong> and <strong>limit of tolerance</strong>.</li><li>Strategies for Increasing the Heat<ul><li>Direct the focus of attention to the though issues.</li><li>Surface conflicts. Resist the temptation to conceal disagreement.</li><li>Allow provocative statements.</li><li>Know and use the room&rsquo;s dynamics. Start with listening and observing. If certain parties appear especially at odds, use that to highlight the core issues.</li><li>Exceed comfort levels. This is especially true for allocating responsibility. Encourage others not to play it safe when it comes to owning their part of the work to be done.</li></ul></li><li>Decreasing the heat is required when the group exceeds the limit of tolerance:<ul><li><strong>Redirect the focus to technical work.</strong></li><li><strong>Assume responsibility for the though issues.</strong></li><li><strong>Divide, distribute, and pace the work.</strong></li><li><strong>Pause and take breaks.</strong></li><li><strong>Create more structures and processes for working on the challenge.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=anchor-yourself>Anchor Yourself</h2><h3 id=hold-steady>Hold steady</h3><ul><li>Be able to <strong>manage yourself, listen, stay quiet and deliberate and wait for what&rsquo;s the right opening, right response.</strong></li><li>Sometimes you have to <strong>be able to wait</strong> for 10 min, sometimes for 10 years.</li><li>Keeping the eye on what really matters is absolutely essential.</li></ul><h3 id=ambitions-and-inspirations>Ambitions and Inspirations</h3><ul><li>Ambition is about getting things for yourself.</li><li>Aspirations is about what you want to give.</li></ul><h3 id=sanctuary>Sanctuary</h3><h3 id=allies-and-confidants>Allies and Confidants</h3><ul><li>Confidants will help you to maintain discipline.</li><li>Allies bring also another constituencies (Wahlkreis, Interessensgemeinschaft).</li><li>Ally cannot be always true to you, because he&rsquo;s got his primary loyalty to his constituency.</li><li>Leadership becomes more dangerous if you&rsquo;re isolated.</li><li>You can&rsquo;t do it yourself. You can&rsquo;t lead alone.</li></ul><h2 id=staying-alive>Staying alive</h2><ul><li>One of the ways to stay in the game through despair is to <strong>free yourself form the myth of measurement.</strong></li><li>You can&rsquo;t run an organization without measuring things.</li><li>Measuring doesn&rsquo;t capture all truth.</li><li>The good is beyond any measure. <strong>Give yourself permission to take pleasure and heart and joy in the fruits of your own labour.</strong></li><li><strong>If you only look at what&rsquo;s left undone you&rsquo;re at risk of burning out.</strong></li><li>Remind each other.</li></ul><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
