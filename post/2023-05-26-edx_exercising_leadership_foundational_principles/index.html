<h2 id="introduction-get-on-the-balcony">Introduction: Get on the Balcony</h2>
<ul>
<li>People learn best from experience. Doing things enables people to learn, not theory (reading/seeing).</li>
<li>Lessons from your own experience stick with you best.</li>
<li>The balcony is the place from which you can step back and observe. So that you can get back on the floor and make your next move.</li>
<li>In leadership, the most common sources of problem are diagnostics. If you get the problem wrong, generally the action will be wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-definition-of-leadership">A definition of Leadership</h3>
<ul>
<li>In any group of people, we only need leadership when we face challenges.</li>
<li>People mistake the personal abilities, the hands or the tools as the essence of leadership, rather than the work to be done.</li>
<li>Nobody has ever come with a key characteristics of a leader.</li>
<li>Leadership is critical because we do face challenges in our lives.</li>
<li>How do you mobilize people to get the important work to get done?</li>
<li>Think of leadership like the craft of carpentry. Good hands and tools don&rsquo;t define carpentry. Building something does. Challenges do.</li>
<li>Most common source of confusion about leadership is thinking about it as a set of abilities and tools.</li>
<li>Leadership - practice of mobilizing people to meet though challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identify-the-work-to-be-done">Identify the work to be done</h2>
<h3 id="technical-problems">Technical Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Routine. Easy to solve.</li>
<li>Not necessarily simple, but the know-how and systems are ready to go.</li>
<li>Not determined by complexity or its importance, but the degree to which the challenge already lies within our capacity to solve.</li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s technical problems were yesterday&rsquo;s adaptive challenges.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t really need leadership, need people to do their job.</li>
<li>Require only authoritative and sometimes managerial expertise.</li>
<li>Leadership and Authority: You don&rsquo;t need leadership if you&rsquo;re just doing what you know how to do already.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adaptive-challenges">Adaptive Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gap we don&rsquo;t know yet how to close. Gaps between our aspirations and reality.</li>
<li>Requires developing a new capability.</li>
<li>Unlike in all other places in nature, our adaptive challenges are not only produced by external forces.</li>
<li>Pain. Novelty. Uncertainty about what we might lose in the process.</li>
<li>People love change when it is a good thing. What people resit is the losses that sometimes accompany change.</li>
<li>Leadership requires deep understanding for the pains of change.</li>
<li>What to give up and what innovations will enable us to take the best from our history into the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="leadership-through-adaptive-work">Leadership through Adaptive Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t believe a persuasive visionary leader can step in and solve adaptive challenges people are facing.</li>
<li><strong>Know-how is yet to be developed</strong> and has to reside in the hears of minds of the people who are living the solution.</li>
<li>Leadership, as the term is used in this course, is the <strong>practice of adaptive work.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-do-we-misdiagnose">Why Do We Misdiagnose?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Success of leadership depends on your ability to distinguish challenges that are technical (requiring authority, management) vs. that are adaptive .</li>
<li>Tendency to apply technical solutions to adaptive challenges -&gt; low implementation rates of good ideas. E.g. recommending diet and exercise to patients and they don&rsquo;t comply.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authority-and-misdiagnosis">Authority and Misdiagnosis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Authority impedes diagnostic capability. Expectations of people create an <strong>enormous pressure on people to provide answers rather than raise tough questions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>With adaptive problems you cannot take the problem of people&rsquo;s shoulders. People themselves are part of the problem and thus solution.</strong></li>
<li>The more distress, the stronger the yearning for authorities to know the way.</li>
<li>2nd problem of misdiagnosis is personal. Ability to solve problems is part of the identity of &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Often best you can do is to:
<ul>
<li>frame up the right questions</li>
<li>identify the key realities that need to be addressed</li>
<li>challenge people to take responsibility for tackling the problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We all take pride in knowing rather than not.</li>
<li>Being able to step back and go to the balcony and notice when and how you&rsquo;re being pushed to see the challenge as a technical problem is crucial skill in providing effective leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unbundling-the-work">Unbundling the Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most problems come bundled.</li>
<li>If we treat bundled problems as if it were only technical, we&rsquo;re going to neglect critical parts of the problem and won&rsquo;t really meet the challenge.</li>
<li>Once diagnosed, how would you begin to mobilize people to develop that capacity.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know is a good place to start. It&rsquo;s difficult to be able to say so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lead-with-beyond-and-without-authority">Lead With, Beyond and Without Authority</h2>
<h3 id="nature-of-authority">Nature of Authority</h3>
<ul>
<li>How would you disappoint people at a rate they can stand?</li>
<li>If people expect you to know, but you&rsquo;re saying we don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;re part of the problem.</li>
<li>Social system implies authority structures and authority relationships.</li>
<li>Not all crude power is authority.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re willingly giving a person authority, personal power. Often by habit. Often not a conscious choice.</li>
<li>Power ultimately comes from the people who do the authorizing.</li>
