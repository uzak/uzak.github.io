I&rsquo;ve never met anybody. I would not claim that myself fully, partially at times.</li><li>Once you start working with spirit there is no need for audience.</li><li>Spirit doesn&rsquo;t need public acclaim, his work are unseen, unknown. He&rsquo;s the real invisible power behind the scenes. It&rsquo;s the life, the life force. Who&rsquo;s ever seen it? Who&rsquo;s ever seen electricity? It&rsquo;s recognized by its effects.</li><li>John the baptist: Behold, the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world.</li><li>When the heart is melted, what comes out of it? Love. No glorification, no I love you.</li><li>What does love see? Love sees perfection in the bellowed? Love see no ill. Nothing but loveliness. Love sees purity. The pure in heart see god.</li><li>There is no need to go to India to look for gurus. Look at the lamb, let your heart be melted, let your tears run and you&rsquo;ll be as close to god as you ever be. You don&rsquo;t need a teacher. Teacher is in-front of your nose.</li><li>My entire life has expressed not what I&rsquo;m, but what I&rsquo;m not.</li><li>You want peace? Stillness? Earth is still, rocks are still. Put your feet on the ground. But the mind likes its own restlessness.</li><li>If you want to bring the world to peace, star with yourself. That&rsquo;s the essence of prayer. Heal yourself.</li><li>The destiny of the world of sin is to rot away. Sin is death. Duality is on death row, duality is death.</li><li>Real life is in spirit.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re serious about helping yourself or even better helping others, put prayer into practice. Practice what you preach. To make whole be whole.</li><li>Humanism - worship of the body. We think we&rsquo;re so clever. We completely turn away from the point of life. We miss the true destiny of man - which is spirit, which is the kingdom of heaven.</li></ul><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
