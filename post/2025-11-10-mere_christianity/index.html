It was held by the great Prussian philosopher Hegel and, as far as I can understand them, the Hindus. The other view is held by Jews, Mohammedans and Christians.</li><li>Christianity is a fighting religion.</li><li>My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of <em>just</em> and <em>unjust</em>?</li><li><strong>If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that is has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be a word without meaning.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-invasion>The Invasion</h3><ul><li>It is no good asking for a simple religion. After all real things are not simple. They look simple, but they are not.</li><li><strong>Reality, in fact, is usually something you could not have guessed. That is one of the reasons I believe Christianity. It is a religion you could have not guessed.</strong></li><li>Christian view that this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains memory of what it ought have been. The other is called Dualism. Dualism means the belief that there are two equal and independent powers at the back of everything, one of them good and the other bad, and that this universe is the battlefield in which they fight out an endless war. I personally think that next to Christianity Dualism is the manliest and most sensible creed on the market.</li><li><strong>good means what you ought to prefer quite regardless of what you happen to like at any given moment.</strong></li><li>you are putting into the universe a third thing in addition to the two Powers: some law or standard or rule of good which one of the powers conforms to and the other fails to conform to.</li><li><strong>pleasure, money, power, and safety are all, as far as they go, good things. The badness consists in pursuing them by the wrong method, or in the wrong way, or too much.</strong></li><li><strong>You can be good for mere sake of goodness: you cannot be bad for the mere sake of badness.</strong></li><li>Goodness is, so to speak itself: <strong>badness is only spoiled goodness.</strong></li><li>We call sadism a sexual perversion; but you must first have the idea of a normal sexuality before you can talk of its being perverted.</li><li>To be bad, he must exist and have intelligence and will. But existence, intelligence and will are in themselves good. Therefore he must be getting them from the Good Power.</li><li>devil is a fallen angel</li><li><strong>civil war, a rebellion, and that we are living in a part of the universe occupied by the rebel.</strong></li><li><strong>Enemy-occupied territory - that is what this world is.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-shocking-alternative>The Shocking Alternative</h3><ul><li>If a thing is free to be good it is also free to be bad.</li><li><strong>free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.</strong></li><li><strong>The moment you have a self at all, there is a possibility of putting yourself first - wanting to be the centre - wanting to be God, in fact. That is the sin of Satan.</strong></li><li>some corruption in our sexual nature followed the fall and it was the result, not its cause.</li><li><strong>Good designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on.</strong></li><li>First of all <strong>He left us conscience.</strong></li><li>Secondly, He sent the human race what I call <strong>good dreams - queer stories scattered through heathen religions about a god who dies and comes to life again, and by his death, has somehow given new life to men</strong></li><li>Thirdly, He <strong>selected one particular people</strong> and spent several centuries hammering into their heads the sort of God He was - that there was only one of Him and that He cared about right conduct.</li><li><strong>unhesitatingly behaved as He was the party concerned, the person chiefly offended in all offences. This make sense if He really was the God whose laws are broken and whose love is wounded in every sin.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-perfect-penitent>The Perfect Penitent</h3><ul><li><strong>A man can eat his dinner without understanding exactly how food nourishes him. A man can accept what Christ ha done without knowing how it works</strong></li><li>Christ was killed for us, that His death has washed our sins, and that by dying He disabled death itself.</li><li><strong>fallen man is not simple an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel who must lay down his arms.</strong> Laying down your arms, <strong>surrendering, saying you are sorry, realising that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground floor</strong> - that is the only way out of our &lsquo;hole&rsquo;.</li><li><strong>Only a bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person - and he would not need it.</strong></li><li><strong>Just as our thinking can succeed only because it is a drop out of the ocean of His intelligence: but we cannot share God&rsquo;s dying unless God dies; and He cannot die except by being a man. That is the sense in which He pays our debts, and suffers for us what He Himself need not suffer at all.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-practical-conclusion>The Practical Conclusion</h3><ul><li><strong>The perfect surrender and humiliation were undergone by Christ: perfect because He was God, surrender and humiliation because he was man.</strong></li><li><strong>life - we derived it from others</strong>, from our father and mother and all our ancestors, <strong>without our consent - and by a very curious process, involving pleasure, pain, and danger.</strong></li><li>you are not making it, you are only keeping up a life you got from someone else. In the same way a Christian can lose the Christ-life which has been put into him and he has to make efforts to keep it.</li><li><strong>he is only nourishing and protecting a life he could never have acquired by his own efforts.</strong></li><li>A live body is not one that never gets hurt, but one that can to some extend repair itself. In the same way a Christian is not a man who never goes wrong, but a man who is enabled to repent and pick himself up and begin over again after each stumble - because <strong>the Christ-life is inside him, repairing him all the time, enabling him to repeat (in some degree) the kind of voluntary death which Christ Himself carried out.</strong></li><li><strong>He does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us</strong>; just as the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright, but becomes bright because the sun shines on it.</li><li><strong>God never meant man to be a purely spiritual creature.</strong> That is why He uses material things like bread and wine to put the new life into us.</li><li>Christians are Christ&rsquo;s body, the organism through which he works. Every addition to that body enables Him to do more.</li><li><strong>He wants to give us the chance of joining His side freely.</strong></li><li>There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up.</li></ul><h2 id=book-iii-christian-behaviour>Book III: Christian Behaviour</h2><h3 id=the-three-parts-of-morality>The Three Parts of Morality</h3><ul><li><strong>moral rules are directions for running the human machine.</strong></li><li>human individual drift apart from one another, or else collide with one another and do one another damage, by cheating or bullying. The other is when things go wrong inside the individual</li><li>The voyage will be a success only, in the first place, if the ship do not collide and get in one another&rsquo;s way; and, secondly, if each ship is seaworthy and has her engines in good order.</li><li>Unless we go on to the second thing - the tidying up inside each human being - we are only deceiving ourselves.</li><li><strong>We cannot make men good by law: and without good men you cannot have a good society.</strong></li><li><strong>if we are to think about morality, we must think of all three departments: relations between man and man: things inside each man: and relations between man and the power that made him.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-cardinal-virtues>The &lsquo;Cardinal Virtues&rsquo;</h3><ul><li>Prudence means practical common sense, taking the trouble to think out what you are doing and what is likely to come out of it</li><li>He wants a child&rsquo;s heart, but a grown up&rsquo;s head.</li><li>one of the reasons why it needs no special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education itself.</li><li><strong>Temperance referred &mldr; to all pleasures; and it meant not abstaining, but going the right length and no further. It is a mistake to think that Christians ought all to be teetotallers; Mohammedanism, not Christianity, is the teetotal religion.</strong></li><li><strong>One of the marks of a certain type of bad man is that cannot give up a thing himself without wanting every one else to give it up.</strong></li><li>Justice &mldr; is the old name for everything we should now call &lsquo;fairness&rsquo;.</li><li>just as a mathematician&rsquo;s mind has a certain habit and outlook which is there even when he is not doing mathematics. In the same way a <strong>man who perseveres in doing just actions gets in the end a certain quality of character.</strong></li><li>We might think that God wanted simply obedience to a set of rules: whereas He really wants people of a particular sort.</li><li>The point is not that God will refuse you admission to His eternal world if you have not got certain qualities of character: the point is that i<strong>f people have not got at least the beginnings of those qualities inside them, then no possible external conditions could make a &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo; for them - that is, could make them happy with the deep, strong, unshakable kind of happiness God intends for us.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=social-morality>Social Morality</h3><ul><li>The clergy are those particular people within the whole Church who have been specially trained and set aside to look after what concerns us as creatures who are going to live for ever.</li><li>there are to be no passengers or parasites: if man does not work, he ought not eat. Every one is to work with his own hands, and what is more, every one&rsquo;s work is to produce something good: there will be no manufacture of silly luxuries and then of sillier advertisements to persuade us to buy them.</li><li>obedience (and outward marks of respect) from all us to properly appointed magistrates, from children to parents, and (I am afraid this is going to be very unpopular) from wives to husbands.</li><li>All these people told us not to lend money at interest, and lending money at interest - what we all investments - is the basis of our whole system.</li><li>every one must work, it gives a reason &lsquo;in order that he may have something to give to those in need&rsquo;</li><li><strong>For many of us the great obstacle to charity lies not in our luxurious living or desire for more money, but in our fear - fear of insecurity</strong>.</li><li>I may repeat &lsquo;Do as you would be done by&rsquo; till I am black in the face, but I cannot really carry out till I love my neighbour as myself: and I cannot learn to love my neighbour as myself till I learn to love God: and I cannot learn to love God except by learning to obey Him.</li></ul><h3 id=morality-and-psychoanalysis>Morality and Psychoanalysis</h3><ul><li><strong>The bad psychological material is not a sin but a disease. It does not need to be repented of, but to be cured.</strong> And by the way, that is very important. <strong>Human beings judge one another by their external actions. God judges them by their moral choices.</strong></li><li><strong>every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before.</strong> And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing either into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature: either into a creature that is in harmony with God, and with other creatures, and with itself, or else into one that is in a state of war and hatred with God, and with its fellow creatures, and with itself.</li><li><strong>When a man is getting better he understands more and more clearly the evil that is left in him. When a man is getting worse he understands his own badness less and less.</strong></li><li>You understand sleep when you are awake, not while you are sleeping.</li></ul><h3 id=sexual-morality>Sexual Morality</h3><ul><li>A real desire to believe all the good you can of others and to make others as comfortable as you can will solve most of the problems.</li><li><strong>&ldquo;Either marriage, with complete faithfulness to your partner, or else total abstinence&rdquo;.</strong></li><li>sexual appetite, like our other appetites, grows by indulgence. Starving men may think much about food, but so do gluttons; the gorged, as well as the famished, like titillations.</li><li>a man with an obsession is a man who has very little sales-resistance.</li><li>Before we can be cured we must want to be cured</li><li>Virtue - even attempted virtue - brings light, indulgence brings fog.</li><li>If anyone things that Christians regard unchastity as the supreme vice, he is quite wrong. <strong>The sins of flesh are bad, but they are the least bad of all sins. All the worst pleasures are purely spiritual.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=christian-marriage>Christian Marriage</h3><ul><li><strong>man and wife are to be regarded as single organism</strong></li><li>The monstrosity of sexual intercourse outside marriage is that those who indulge in it are trying to isolate one kind of union (the sexual) from all other kinds of union which were intended to go along with it and make up the total union.</li><li><strong>divorce as something like cutting up a living body, as a kind of surgical operation.</strong></li><li><strong>Justice, as I said before, includes the keeping of promises</strong></li><li><strong>those who are in love have a natural inclination to bind themselves by promises.</strong></li><li><strong>&lsquo;being in love&rsquo; is a glorious state, and, in several ways, good for us. It helps to make us generous and courageous, it opens our eyes not only to the beauty of the beloved but to all beauty, and it subordinates (especially at first) our merely animal sexuality; in that sense, love is the great conqueror of lust.</strong></li><li><strong>Being in love is a good thing, but is not the best thing.</strong></li><li>the dying away of the first thrill will be compensated by a quieter and more lasting kind of interest.</li><li><strong>A thing will not really live unless it first dies.</strong></li><li>Christian wives promise to obey their husbands. In Christian marriage the man is said to be the &lsquo;head&rsquo;.</li><li>when there is areal disagreement, what is to happen?</li><li><strong>family policy. You cannot have a permanent association without a constitution.</strong></li><li>There must be something unnatural about the rule of wives over husbands, because the wives themselves are half ashamed of it and despise the husbands whom they rule.</li><li><strong>The relations of the family to the outer world - what might be called its foreign policy - must depend, in the last resort, upon the man, because he always ought to be, and usually is, much more just to the outsiders.</strong> A woman is primarily fighting for her own children and husband against the rest of the world.</li><li>She is the special trustee of their interests.</li><li><strong>He has the last word in order to protect other people from the intense family patriotism of the wife.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=forgiveness>Forgiveness</h3><ul><li>Every one says forgiveness is a lovely idea, until they have something to forgive.</li><li>if we do not forgive we shall not be forgiven.</li><li>hate a bad man&rsquo;s actions, but not hate the bad man; or, as they would say, <strong>hate the sin but not the sinner.</strong></li><li>there was one man to whom I had been doing this all my life - namely myself.</li><li>with that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white as black itself. <strong>Finally, we shall insist on seeing everything - God and our friends and ourselves included - as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.</strong></li><li>loving myself does not mean that I ought not to subject myself to punishment</li><li>It is, therefore, in my opinion, perfectly right for a Christian judge to sentence a man to death or a Christian soldier to kill an enemy.</li><li><strong>All killing is not murder any more than all sexual intercourse is adultery.</strong></li><li>The idea of the knight - the Christian in arms for the defense of a good cause - is one of the great Christian ideas.</li><li>Remember, we <strong>Christians think man lives for ever.</strong> Therefore, <strong>what really matters in those little marks or twists on the central, inside part of the soul which are going to turn it, in the long run, into a heavenly or hellish creature.</strong> We may kill if necessary, but we must not hate and enjoy hating. We may punish if necessary, but we must not enjoy it.</li><li>Even while we kill and punish we must try to feel about the enemy as we feel about ourselves - to wish that he were not bad, to hope that he may, in this world or another, be cured: in fact, to wish him good.</li></ul><h3 id=the-great-sin>The Great Sin</h3><ul><li>There is no fault which makes a man more unpopular, and no fault which we are more unconscious of in ourselves. And the more we have it ourselves, the more we dislike it in others.</li><li><strong>Pride or Self-Conceit</strong></li><li>the utmost evil</li><li>it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: <strong>Pride leads to every other vice: it is complete anti-God state of mind.</strong></li><li>each person&rsquo;s pride is in competition with every one else&rsquo;s pride. It is because I want to be the big noise at the party that I am so annoyed at someone else being the big noise.</li><li>Pride is <em>essentially</em> competitive - is competitive by its very nature - while the other vices are competitive only, so to speak, by accident. <strong>Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man.</strong></li><li>there is nothing makes a man feel so superior to others as being able to move them about like toy soldiers. What makes a pretty girl spread misery wherever she goes by collecting admirers?</li><li>What is it that makes a political leader or a whole nation to go on and on demanding more and more?</li><li><strong>pride always means enmity - it is enmity.</strong></li><li>A proud man is always looking down on things and people: and of course, as long as you&rsquo;re looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.</li><li>The real test of being in the presence of God is, that you either forget about yourself altogether or see yourself as a small, dirty object. It is better to forget about yourself altogether.</li><li>The devil laughs. He is perfectly content to see you becoming chaste and brave and self-controlled provided, all the time, he is setting you up in the Dictatorship of Pride.</li><li><strong>Pride is spiritual cancer: it eats up the very possibility of love, or contentment, or even common sense</strong></li><li>Pleasure in being praised is not Pride.</li><li>devil loves &lsquo;curing&rsquo; a small fault by giving you a great one. We must try not to be vain, but we must never call it our Pride to cure our vanity.</li><li>it would be better than being proud simply of himself.

But <strong>love, in the Christian sense, does not mean an emotion.

In a two-dimensional world, you still get straight lines, but many lines make one figure. In a three-dimension world, you still get figures but many figures make one solid body. In other words, <strong>as you advance to more real and more complicated levels, you do not leave behind you the things you found on the simpler levels: you still have them, but combined a new ways - in ways you could not imagine if you knew only the simpler levels.</strong></li><li>In God&rsquo;s dimension, so to speak, you find a being who is three Persons while remaining one Being, just as a cube is six squares while remaining one cube.</li><li><strong>God is the thing to which he is praying - the goal he is trying to reach. God is also the thing inside him which is pushing him on - the motive power. God is also the road or bridge along which he is being pushed to that goal.</strong></li><li><strong>he is being pulled into God, by God, while still remaining himself.</strong></li><li>When you come to knowing God, the initiative lies on His side. If He does not show Himself, nothing you can do will enable you to find Him.</li><li>it is impossible for Him to show Himself to a man whose whole mind and character are in the wrong condition. Just as sunlight, through it has no favourites, cannot be reflected in a dusty mirror as clearly as in a clean one.</li><li><strong>the instrument through which you see God is your whole self. And if a man&rsquo;s self is not kept clean and bright, his glimpse of God will be blurred. That is why horrible nations have horrible religions: they have been looking at God through a dirty lens</strong></li><li>If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make it easier. <strong>We cannot compete, in simplicity, with people who are inventing religions.

Once a man is separated from God, what can he but wither and die?</strong></li><li>if we can let God have His way, come to share in the life of Christ.</li><li>Christ is the Son of God. If we share in this kind of life we also shall be sons of God. <strong>We shall love the Father as He does and the Holy Ghost will arise in us.</strong></li><li>Every Christian is to become a little Christ.

It would look like <strong>one single growing thing - rather like a very complicated tree. Every individual would appear connected with every other. And not only that. Individuals are not really separate from God any more than from one another.</strong></li><li>business of becoming a son of God, of being turned from a created thing into a begotten thing, of passing over from the temporary biological life into timeless &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; life, has been done for us.

He is beginning to turn you into the same kind of thing as Himself.</strong></li><li><strong>If there were no help from Christ, there would be no help from other human beings.</strong> He works on us in all sorts of ways: not only through what we thing our &lsquo;religious life&rsquo;. He works through Nature, through our own bodies, through books, sometimes through experiences which seem (at the time) anti-Christian.</li><li>usually it is those who know Him that bring Him to others. That is why the Church, the whole body of Christians showing Him to one another, is so important.</li><li>At first it is natural for a baby to take its mother&rsquo;s milk without knowing its mother.

It is when Dick realises that his niceness is not his own but a gift from God, and when he offers it back to God - it is just then that it beings to be really his own. For now Dick is beginning to take share in his own creation.</strong> The only things we can keep are the things we freely give to God. What we try to keep for ourselves is just what we are sure to lose.</li><li>Often people who have all these natural kinds of goodness cannot be brought to recognise their need for Christ at all until, one day, the natural goodness lets them down and their self-satisfaction is shattered. In other words, it is hard for those who are &lsquo;rich&rsquo; in this sense to enter the Kingdom.</li><li>If you are a nice person - if virtue comes easily to you - beware! <strong>Much is expected from those to whom much is given.</strong></li><li>A world of nice people, content in their own niceness, looking no further, turned away from God, would be just as desperately in need of salvation as a miserable world - and might even be more difficult to save.</li><li><strong>God became man to turn creatures into sons: not simply to produce better men of the old kind but to produce a new kind of man.</strong></li><li>One soul in the whole creation you do know: and i<strong>t is the only one whose fate is placed in your hands.

He came into the created universe, of His own will, bringing with him <em>Zoe</em>, thew new life. (I mean new to us, of course: in its own place <em>Zoe</em> has existed for ever and ever.) <strong>And He transmits it not by heredity but by what I have called &lsquo;good infection&rsquo;.</strong> Everyone who gets it gets it by personal contact with him. Other men became &rsquo;new&rsquo; by being &lsquo;in Him&rsquo;.</li><li>The stakes are higher. By falling back at the earlier steps a creature is lost, at the worst, its few years of life on this earth: very often it did not lose even that. By falling back at this step we lose a prize which is (in the strictest sense of the word) infinite.</li><li><strong>Until we rise and follow Christ we are still part of Nature, still in the womb of our great mother.</strong></li><li><strong>In an ordinary birth the baby has not much choice: here it has.</strong></li><li>Their very voices and faces are different from ours: stronger, quieter, happier, more radiant.</li><li>They do now draw attention to themselves. You tend to think that you are being kind to them when they are really being kind to you. They love you more than other men do, but they need you less.</li><li>they recognise one another immediately and infallibly, across every barrier of colour, class, sex, age, and even of creeds. In that way, to become holy is rather like joining a secret society. To put it at the very lowest, it must be great <em>fun</em>.</li><li>To become new men means losing what we now call &lsquo;ourselves&rsquo;. Out of our selves, into Christ, we must go.</li><li><strong>The more we get what we now call &lsquo;ourselves&rsquo; out of the way and let Him take us over, the more truly ourselves we become.</strong></li><li>It is no good trying to &lsquo;be myself&rsquo; without Him. The more I resist Him and try to live on my won, the more I become dominated by my own heredity and upbringing and surroundings and natural desires.</li><li><strong>It is when I turn to Christ, when I give myself up to His Personality, that I first being to have a real personality of my own.</strong></li><li>There are no real personalities anywhere else. Until you have given up your self to Him you will not have a real self. Sameness is to be found among the most &rsquo;natural&rsquo; men, not among those who surrender to Christ.</li><li>Christ will indeed give you a real personality: but you must not go to Him for the sake of that.</li><li>Your real, new self (which is Christ&rsquo;s and also yours, and yours just because it is His( will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for Him.</li><li><strong>Even in social life, you will never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking about what sort of impression you are making.</strong></li><li><strong>Give up yourself, and you will find your real self.
