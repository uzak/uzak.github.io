O: And what about a man who was dead?</li><li>Your crime is that you tried to steal my world. The world I built with my hands and my sweat. The world I shared with a woman who bore me my son and no one will ever that that from me! Now you&rsquo;ll die to a man in a river of blood.</li><li>I will never leave you.</li><li>It&rsquo;s 20 years since you held me in your eyes. O: That was only one day. P: And in one day you&rsquo;ve seen all the world? O: Yes. So much that is sacred and beautiful, but nothing as beautiful as a man&rsquo;s own world. That he can take in his hands and always be his. You are my world.</li></ul><p>Also see <a href=http://www.noologie.de/quer.htm#_Toc25566870 target=_blank rel=noopener>noologie.de</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Please allow me to Introduce Myself, I am a man of Mnaemae and Phrenae, Mnaemo is my name, and Peirasis is my Game. [29]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pe(i)rasis means: the going through, the going beyond, the transcending; mnaemae: memory; phrenae: mind/brain/ Intelligence/ Inter-Legerence. The word mnaemo- connects us to Maemosynae, the ancient Greek &ldquo;Mother of the Muses&rdquo;, the numinous personification of memory, and of poetic inspi­ration of the Aoidoi, the bards, epic singers, and prophets, of antiquity. It also reminds us of the captain Nemo in Jules Verne&rsquo;s novel. Nemo in Greek means: outis, maedeis, oudeis, and this is the name that Odysseus called himself in the land of the Kyklops. (Od. 9,366). From the word sounds, we can get an interesting &ldquo;pattern that connects&rdquo; oudeis and Odysseus. As the captain, and seafarer, he is a gubernator or kybernaetaes. In his fragment B 64, Heraklitos alludes to this: ta de panta oiakizei Keraunos: The Kόsmos is steered by the Keraunos: the thunderbolt, or the Vajra.[30] Odysseus had to endure seven years of captivity, on the island of Ogygia, the Omphalos of the Thalassaean sea (Od. 1,50; v. Dechend 1993: 183-185, 193, 269, 324).[31] There is a deep cave, the hiding place of the God of Time: Kronos, in Plutarch&rsquo;s account (v. Dechend 1993: 121). Kronos is the original owner of the Keraunos, before his son Zeus, or Jupiter, had wrenched it from his fist, to govern the universe himself as usurpator. This island is guarded by the nymph Kalypso, whose name means &ldquo;the Veiled One&rdquo; (kalyptron, Od. 5.232), she is the personified numinous power of veiling, obscuring, and occulting, in the ancient Greek Homeric Mythology. Her name also connects to the flower- kalyx, and the seed husk, thus symbolizing the encapsulation of future poten­tial. She shares her occulting power with Laethae, the numinous force of death-forget­ting. (Illich (1988: 13); Hesiodos (1978: verse 211 ff.)). When Odysseus was finally allowed to leave his place of banishment, Kalypso gave him two special tools to cut the trees and fashion his raft: two double axes,[32] the pelekys megas, and the skeparnon, both being variants of the original Keraunos. (Od. 5.234-237; Dechend 1977). Now, as v. Dechend tells us, the Keraunos is the tool of the time, belonging to the god of the time: Kronos. One could say: nomen est omen, because Kronos, Chronos and Keraunos are deeply related through their sound. He is also the Saeturnus, the God of The Golden Age. And by its use, Time, the present, the past, and the future, is initially created, en archae, as is related in the mythic account of Hesiodos (1978). Its most common symbol in many cultures world wide is the double axe, the Pelekys, Thor&rsquo;s Hammer, or the Labrys, as it was called in Minoan Crete. (Marija Gimbutas sees a butterfly image in its symbolism, which has its own reasoning, via the temporal stages of Metamorphosis, and their initiatic associations: caterpillar / chrysa­lis / butterfly (Gimbutas 1974: 185-190)). The Keraunos cuts both ways: into the past, and into the future. Its axis / axle / hub is the Kairos, the present, the decisive moment, the instant of creation, the Now. In the grand gory finale of the Odyssey, Homer descri­bes down to the minutest detail the feat how Odysseus shoots his arrow through the hubs of twelve aligned double axes, the abovementioned pelekon. (Od. 21.75-21.421). Since these are twelve, they cannot be anything else but the hubs of the Precession of the Equinoxes. Let is be said that the Omphalos is a navel as well as a hub (gomphos, Parmenides 1974: B1,17-20), and how else could the Keraunos steer the Universe than through the hub? (German: Nabe -> Nabel). In Roman mythology, the threshold of the past and the future is guarded by the god Janus, the Double-Faced One, who looks into the past, as well as into the future. He ist the guardian of the Limen, the Threshold, called peras, in Greek. (See also, the liminal, in Gennep 1960). His name re-appears in the month January. A lesser known aspect of the mythological chronology of January was that after the winter solstice on Dec. 21 (and the official end of the year), the following week was considered &ldquo;outside of the time&rdquo;, that is, in the liminal, or limbo, and also in the hub of the time, until the new year began. This was the time for the Great Roman Festivity of the Saturnalia.[33] Not without good reason, the celebration of the birth of the Christ was placed right in the middle of this period, to Dec. 24. The captain Nemo in Jules Verne&rsquo;s Novel makes his journeys in the Nautilus, or nao-telos, the naos, a submerged, or sub-liminal, ship. According to Vedic Mythology, the Vajra was hidden on the ground of the Oceanos. (Dechend 1977: 99). But naos also evokes our association to noos, and nous, the thoughts, the stuff out of which our memories, ima­ginations, and anticipations, are fashioned. The connection of nous and telos (aim, goal, finish, completion, success, death, limit -> peras) leads us into the association field of anticipation, and planning, in the ancient mythologies personified by Pro-metheus, the before-thinker.[34] This was also a characteristic of Odysseus the poly-maechanaes, the crafty, cunning, ruseful. Our mental imagery consists of things per­ceived as phai-nomena, as impressions derived from sensory inputs, and as nou-mena, the impressions derived from mental, noetic, or noietic, sources. The Mnaemo-synae is the ancient numinous personification of those forces, patterns, and processes which do their work under the surface of the visible and intelligible, in the mae-phainon, the realm below, and before they turn into the phai-nomena, and the nou-mena. These are, in scientific terminology, the workings of neuronal activation patterns, of oscillation fields and logical relation structures of neuronal assemblies, of the coupled dynamic systems of neuronal attractors, of our brains: the phrenae. The mnaemo-synae reminds us of this still quite mysterious working of the neuronal sym-plexis, and syn-apsis, by which our sym-ballein, the concept formation is effected. When the subliminal wor­kings of the neuronal webworks of our phrenae then weave (histon, historia) together into the appearances of the intellegible and discernible, they become ho phainon, that which finds its appearance through phos, the light, and phonae, the sound, as ap­pearance, and apparition, phaino-menon (in German: Auf-Scheinendes), with form: mor-phae, and Gestalt. This, Ho Phainon, the Brilliant, the Shining One (in German: Er-scheinung), is also the name of the god Hae-phaistos, he who works the bril­liant and shining metals, while they are red and glowing: phoibos, and phoinos, phos-phoros (lucifer). With his hammer and anvil, and with his mighty blows, he forges them into their forms, the mor-phae. And with his hammering, the metallic sounds of phonae and phthongos ring out to make themselves heard awide and afar. &mldr;</p></blockquote></article></div><section class=article-navigation><p><a class=link href=/post/2021-04-08-shivananda_lahari/><span class=li></span>Sivananda Lahari</a></p><p><a class=link href=/post/2021-04-02-clean_code/><span class=li></span>Clean Code</a class="link"></p></section><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=uzak/uzak.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOGkA1Jg data-category=Q&A data-category-id=DIC_kwDOGkA1Js4CO1WV data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-theme=light data-lang=en-US crossorigin=anonymous async></script></section><section id=footer class="footer max-body-width"><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>©2022 Martin Uzak</p></div><div class=footer-wrap><a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh target=_blank rel=noopener>CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a><span> | </span><a href=/index.xml target=_blank rel=noopener>RSS</a></div><div class=footer-wrap><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://github.com/qdzhang/hugo-notepadium-mod target=_blank rel=noopener>Notepadium-mod</a></p></div><div class=footer-wrap><a onclick='window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"smooth"})'>^ TOP ^</a></div></section></div></body></html>
