<ul>
<li>In Sanskrit seeing and knowing are taken as the same. Seer (drg) means knower. Seeing is more than knowing, it carries a punch in it which knowing doesn&rsquo;t have. &ldquo;Do you know Vaikuntha?&rdquo; Like that.</li>
<li>Objects, need not be physical, are all part of the seen (drshya). The seen is more than just physical, all your ideas that you have. Except you, everything else is the seen.</li>
<li>Karana and karya vada are the words of the dualist. Very provisional theory. Before you become victim of this, you have to move to drg drshya viveka to be safe from duality and unfortunate mix-up of religion and philosophy.</li>
<li>The line of argument here is the discernment between you, the knowing element, and all that is known.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not any of the things that you imagine about yourself. Provisionally we give you a title &ldquo;jiva&rdquo;. Because you do not allow the divinity to come out.</li>
<li>If you give drg drshya viveka a chance, it will force you into your divinity.</li>
<li>Purify the &ldquo;I&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve collected so much it that it becomes a big task. How you do it? No effort, just vichara. Knowing the false as the false, investigation, is the toughest thing. People go for the easy thing and avoid the real one.</li>
<li>Guru will not, cannot break the shell from outside. You&rsquo;ve to do it from inside.</li>
<li>Those who want to see UFOs will see UFOs. <strong>Those who think of a god in a way will see god such way. Mind becomes the God. What you see, what you know cannot be the truth.</strong></li>
<li>Karma, upasana is outward looking. Jnanam, yoga is inward looking. They cannot be combined.</li>
<li>Karma -&gt; phala later. It is mediate. Realization has immediate benefit. Like with rope and snake. Now and here. Can there be understanding in the future? Understanding happens only in the present. Only death happens in the future.</li>
<li>In Sanskrit, &ldquo;cha&rdquo; and &ldquo;ka&rdquo; are interchangeable. Lochanam -&gt; luk (taking &ldquo;ana&rdquo; way makes guna go away too and &lsquo;o&rsquo; -&gt; &lsquo;u&rsquo;, &lsquo;ch&rsquo; and &lsquo;k&rsquo; are interchangeable).</li>
<li>Prepare your consciousness in which you do not pay attention to the form. Form is unimportant, because it is not real. <strong>The more you pay attention to the form, the more you have emotional investment to the form, the more trouble you&rsquo;re creating yourself.</strong> It is always the false that binds. Truth liberates.</li>
<li><strong>Memory makes you think a lot. Keep it away when you don&rsquo;t need it.</strong> We&rsquo;re registering forms since we can remember. How many did we see? There is mental forms, like boundaries between countries, too. The form is known to you, don&rsquo;t make it into &ldquo;you&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>What is is the truth.</li>
<li>sa:itara - en:other. The other means limited means measurable. Jnanam of &hellip; is invalid in the context of brahman, valid in any other case.</li>
<li>People are looking elsewhere for solution of problems of life, happiness. Towards the physical things made of hand, towards another person, towards god. All in vain. Because you must begin with yourself, in yourself. Antarmukhah. Viveka: stop searching outside what can be found only within.</li>
<li>Clarify the mind (of superstitions), purify the heart (do not entertain emotions like hatred, jealousy) and then sanctify your life.</li>
<li><strong>Life is a series of experiences.</strong></li>
<li>Yoga people are dualist, they include people in the aham experience. Bhatka people are dualist too, they include god in the idam experience. Vedantins also say god has to be included in the aham experience only, but go one step further and say aham-brahma-asmi.</li>
<li>idam is aneka. Aham is always eka.</li>
<li>Drshyam is jada, drg is chetana. <strong>Is what I&rsquo;m worshiping jada?</strong> There is any numbers of inadequacies in drshya. Drshya is very fickle, it changes, anything can happen to it.</li>
<li>Literality is religion and spirituality is philosophy.</li>
<li>Bhaktas take sentimentality as atmajnanam.</li>
<li>All I see in this hall is limited. But my eyesight is not limited. It can see anything and everything.</li>
<li>Pascal: as a body I am but a speck in this universe, but with my mind I can assess everything in it. Mind is the seer, that is it&rsquo;s glory. Now go one step further, mind becomes the seen.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not supposed to give importance to the rupa. Learn to ignore the rupa. You love something that is beyond the rupa.</li>
<li>When a form disintegrates, I feel neutral. And when the person was suffering, I feel good about it. People are getting grief-stricken for no reason. Because they invest so much emotionalism in to that form.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Our greed is the investment for the corporate world.
<ul>
<li>Just be totally devoted to the job. Forget about corporate people pushing their ways etc.</li>
<li>Stop finding scapegoats, always look within.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>God bless him.
<ul>
<li>If he&rsquo;s right, I learned something about me and I&rsquo;ve got something to correct.</li>
<li>If he&rsquo;s wrong, thank god he&rsquo;s wrong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Face all the challenges with courage. You&rsquo;d never appeal to the outside, man or god, but to the god who&rsquo;s in you. He&rsquo;s listening to you and always watching you. He&rsquo;s atma, sakshi he&rsquo;s. Appeal to the inner sakshi and take blessing from him and move forward.</li>
<li>Seeing Niagara on the Internet is just nama rupa. You must see and lose yourself in the seeing. That seeing is brahman. The fact, the truth of seeing is brahman. The seer seen superimposition is samsara. Therefore you&rsquo;ve to go to Niagara. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you&rsquo;ve done it, it&rsquo;s always new. It&rsquo;s always for the first time. Meet anything and everything fresh! The number doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s memory, unreal.
<ul>
<li>Few drops of rain on my head I consider a great blessing. In that raindrop I see the origin of all the oceans of the world.</li>
<li>Life is always fresh, we only look at it through the prism of the memory and then it becomes stale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I look at the jealousy. It&rsquo;s very familiar for all of us. I&rsquo;m aware of it, without condemnation. It&rsquo;s natural consequence of comparison, of the way we&rsquo;ve been brought up. It&rsquo;s not a crime. And that I see that it hurts myself and goes against the vision of Vedanta. Jealousy has no meaning, I learn a lesson. This is not accumulative knowledge. From then on I&rsquo;m not feeling jealous.
<ul>
<li>What you learn is not accumulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seeking: substitute seeking with striving and everything will be all-right. Generally people are not earnest. They are just seekers. By habit.</li>
<li>Two kinds of impurities of the mind. Sakashaya dosha - jealousy, anger, etc. Nishkashaya dosha - hyperactivity of the mind, restlessness. You cannot sit for 5 minutes. Simple pranayama will help.
<ul>
<li>Give up multitasking. Be devoted to one task at the time.</li>
<li>Multitasking will not increase productivity. It compromises productivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Religion is belief, philosophy is rational thinking. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUnCgTyqboo&amp;list=PLd6RYR-zr5hFheEjd_0ZjTyCLpbLCMScU">Bhakta &amp; Bhakti</a> talks.
<ul>
<li>easy vs. difficult</li>
<li>divides vs. unites.</li>
<li>binds you vs. sets you free, no shackles</li>
<li>you&rsquo;re a doer vs. you&rsquo;re a non-person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idea that Pujaswami will take birth again is not correct. Atma is the same for all. The only difference is that a mahatma knows it.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the youngsters. They are more dharmic than us. They are certain elements of dharma in us that they don&rsquo;t have. They are more catholic than us. Future generations are already safe. Only we&rsquo;re not safe yet. We have to pay attention to ourselves.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sun illuminates everything&rdquo;. You cannot say that. There is no doing on the part of the sun. It just is. When the sun is, everything gets illuminated. &ldquo;Sun illuminates&rdquo; is also not correct. Illumination is not an action (sun doesn&rsquo;t take a broomstick and removes the darkness). &ldquo;Sun is the shining&rdquo;. Sun is the light. Nothing more, no verb there. Same for brahman.</li>
<li>A wrong question cannot be answered, it can be only seen/understood as a wrong question.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re waiting for something, it can be only death.</li>
<li>Vedantins love death, mrtyuh. Brahmavidyacarya - kathopanishad.</li>
