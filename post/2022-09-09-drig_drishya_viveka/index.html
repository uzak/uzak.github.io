<ul>
<li>the same vision, depth, as an Upanishad.</li>
<li>If you have already studied Vedanta it&rsquo;s difficult to have an open mind. What can I teach you? You already know.</li>
<li>Listen without judging, with open mind, that&rsquo;s meditation. It&rsquo;s up to you to take all this to the level of meditation.</li>
<li><strong>If you live a life of karma yoga you&rsquo;re already a liberated soul.</strong></li>
<li>You see the snake instead of a garment because you&rsquo;re insecure.</li>
<li>Generally for Vedanta classes vijnasus (student of Vedanta) don&rsquo;t come. Parents come.</li>
<li>Parents should intervene with difficulties of the students only when the situation becomes very abnormal. Let them face the music!</li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;m - sat - existence. I know - chit. You always know, whether there is something to know or not.</strong></li>
<li>You do not quiten the mind (you, you &hellip; that&rsquo;s hathayoga). If you try it will revolt. Allow it to become quiet (that&rsquo;s vedanta). It can, if you allow it. Quieting the mind will put you in an everlasting conflict. If the mind wants to come with a never lasting train of thought - let it. You&rsquo;d be able to say &ldquo;I do not mind when the mind is thinking&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Sharanagatih - self-surrender, not only surrender. Surrender of the small-self. It&rsquo;s something to be understood, not something to be done.</li>
<li><strong>In life, whenever you&rsquo;re acting, you&rsquo;ve to ask if the actions are motivated. That&rsquo;s the opposite of sharanagatih.</strong> When you act purposefully, your action is very meaningful, but you do not have any (self-ish) motive behind the action. It means <strong>you&rsquo;re not trying to control, to accomplish anything, because everything is controlled and commanded by the prime mover</strong> (antaryAmi - abiding in everything, commanding and controlling). You just do what is expected of you. This is understanding god, this is difficult. Believing is simple.</li>
<li>Whatever you record in your mind is impressed there for so long that it is very difficult to wipe it out and begin again. And therefore we never catch anything fresh. That&rsquo;s why having an open mind is very difficult. Without putting existing aside you learn nothing fresh, you&rsquo;ll be recycling only. That&rsquo;s not understanding. <strong>Knowledge is the old tape - memory. Understanding is in the present moment.</strong> Knowledge accumulates in the braincells, understanding shines in the heart and liberates. Can we put aside the old way of thinking (bible: the old person)?</li>
<li><strong>Become free from the old. You can do that by only one way. Paying attention.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-1httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrofx3be8jmu"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rofX3BE8jmU">Class 1</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In Sanskrit seeing and knowing are taken as the same. Seer (drg) means knower. Seeing is more than knowing, it carries a punch in it which knowing doesn&rsquo;t have. &ldquo;Do you know Vaikuntha?&rdquo; Like that.</li>
<li>Objects, need not be physical, are all part of the seen (drshya). The seen is more than just physical, all your ideas that you have. Except you, everything else is the seen.</li>
<li>Karana and karya vada are the words of the dualist. Very provisional theory. Before you become victim of this, you have to move to drg drshya viveka to be safe from duality and unfortunate mix-up of religion and philosophy.</li>
<li>The line of argument here is the discernment between you, the knowing element, and all that is known.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not any of the things that you imagine about yourself. Provisionally we give you a title &ldquo;jiva&rdquo;. Because you do not allow the divinity to come out.</li>
<li>If you give drg drshya viveka a chance, it will force you into your divinity.</li>
<li>Purify the &ldquo;I&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve collected so much it that it becomes a big task. How you do it? No effort, just vichara. Knowing the false as the false, investigation, is the toughest thing. People go for the easy thing and avoid the real one.</li>
<li>Guru will not, cannot break the shell from outside. You&rsquo;ve to do it from inside.</li>
<li>Those who want to see UFOs will see UFOs. <strong>Those who think of a god in a way will see god such way. Mind becomes the God. What you see, what you know cannot be the truth.</strong></li>
<li>Karma, upasana is outward looking. Jnanam, yoga is inward looking. They cannot be combined.</li>
<li>Karma -&gt; phala later. It is mediate. Realization has immediate benefit. Like with rope and snake. Now and here. Can there be understanding in the future? Understanding happens only in the present. Only death happens in the future.</li>
<li>In Sanskrit, &ldquo;cha&rdquo; and &ldquo;ka&rdquo; are interchangeable. Lochanam -&gt; luk (taking &ldquo;ana&rdquo; way makes guna go away too and &lsquo;o&rsquo; -&gt; &lsquo;u&rsquo;, &lsquo;ch&rsquo; and &lsquo;k&rsquo; are interchangeable).</li>
<li>Prepare your consciousness in which you do not pay attention to the form. Form is unimportant, because it is not real. <strong>The more you pay attention to the form, the more you have emotional investment to the form, the more trouble you&rsquo;re creating yourself.</strong> It is always the false that binds. Truth liberates.</li>
<li><strong>Memory makes you think a lot. Keep it away when you don&rsquo;t need it.</strong> We&rsquo;re registering forms since we can remember. How many did we see? There is mental forms, like boundaries between countries, too. The form is known to you, don&rsquo;t make it into &ldquo;you&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3jzepmzd7ea"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JZEPmzD7EA">Class 2</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>What is is the truth.</li>
<li>sa:itara - en:other. The other means limited means measurable. Jnanam of &hellip; is invalid in the context of brahman, valid in any other case.</li>
<li>People are looking elsewhere for solution of problems of life, happiness. Towards the physical things made of hand, towards another person, towards god. All in vain. Because you must begin with yourself, in yourself. Antarmukhah. Viveka: stop searching outside what can be found only within.</li>
<li>Clarify the mind (of superstitions), purify the heart (do not entertain emotions like hatred, jealousy) and then sanctify your life.</li>
<li><strong>Life is a series of experiences.</strong></li>
<li>Yoga people are dualist, they include people in the aham experience. Bhatka people are dualist too, they include god in the idam experience. Vedantins also say god has to be included in the aham experience only, but go one step further and say aham-brahma-asmi.</li>
<li>idam is aneka. Aham is always eka.</li>
<li>Drshyam is jada, drg is chetana. <strong>Is what I&rsquo;m worshiping jada?</strong> There is any numbers of inadequacies in drshya. Drshya is very fickle, it changes, anything can happen to it.</li>
<li>Literality is religion and spirituality is philosophy.</li>
<li>Bhaktas take sentimentality as atmajnanam.</li>
<li><strong>All I see in this hall is limited. But my eyesight is not limited. It can see anything and everything.</strong></li>
<li>Pascal: as a body I am but a speck in this universe, but with my mind I can assess everything in it. Mind is the seer, that is it&rsquo;s glory. Now go one step further, mind becomes the seen.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not supposed to give importance to the rupa. Learn to ignore the rupa. You love something that is beyond the rupa.</li>
<li>When a form disintegrates, I feel neutral. And when the person was suffering, I feel good about it. People are getting grief-stricken for no reason. Because they invest so much emotionalism in to that form.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="satsang-2022-09-03httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvygm51pgptrk"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGM51pgPtrk">Satsang 2022-09-03</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;ve questions and I&rsquo;ve answers. We examine things together.</li>
<li>Many questions show that you&rsquo;re thining. Most important is that you&rsquo;re thinking. <strong>Once you start thinking and paying attention you&rsquo;ll find all answers in yourself.</strong></li>
<li>Sanyasa is neither necessary nor sufficient condition for moksha. Sanyasa in spirit you&rsquo;d have. What you have to give up is desire - people don&rsquo;t like that. <strong>Desireless-ness leads to fearlessness. Desirelessness and fearlessness together constitute moksha.</strong> That&rsquo;s the sanyasa you require.</li>
<li>For some people, who don&rsquo;t fit into family life and equally not to worldly life, sanyasa is the avenue available.</li>
<li>People want to maintain diabetes or do you want to get rid of it? Same applies for desires. You don&rsquo;t want to manage them.</li>
<li><strong>Root cause of anxiety is desire, expectation and anticipation.</strong> Attachment breads fear, of which anxiety/worry is only a form of.</li>
<li><strong>Only a doer can have a goal. If you have a goal to be reached, you become anxious.</strong> Surrender the self to Ishvara. If Ishvara wishes, we&rsquo;ll reach whatever we have to reach. <strong>Allow the natural thing happen naturally. Be a guide upon yourself.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It is the thought that generates stress.</strong> Stress is related to anxiety.</li>
<li>Being a worldly person how can you get rid of anxiety? You cannot!</li>
<li><strong>Cellphone makes you anxious. How many times you check your email is a measurement of your anxiety.</strong> Cellphone is the umbilical cord to the world.</li>
<li>Am I playing the role of the father or am I bound by the role?</li>
<li><strong>You have to protect your heart, that is your wealth. Your heart is hiranmayakosha, the treasure full of light of awareness, in that Brahma is shining as atma. You&rsquo;ve to protect it from worldliness. And that is accomplished by satsanga.</strong> You&rsquo;d not talk much. <strong>Talking much makes the mind becomes hyperactive.</strong> It will acquire tremendous speed. Remain alone and disengage with the worldly things, people, context. Don&rsquo;t attend any marriages, festivals, functions., celebrations.</li>
<li>In the temple you don&rsquo;t come across bhaktas. You come across fathers, mothers, afraid people, desirers.  Don&rsquo;t enter the threshold of a temple with identification.</li>
<li>Whatever be the rupa you come across in a temple, say &ldquo;OM&rdquo;. All are OM, nothing else. The Ishvara is in my heart as the inner most self. So you attachment to form is replaced by the sound &ldquo;OM&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Who&rsquo;s learning? <strong>There is no &ldquo;who&rdquo;! That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve to learn. There is only ajnanam, no ajnani.</strong> There is only illness, there is no sick person. Does the physician threat the patient or the illness? He doesn&rsquo;t recognize a patient, only an illness. Jiva is only provisional, sruti goes along for a while until you know that you&rsquo;re brahman.</li>
<li>Vedanta is entirely about unlearning.</li>

<ul>
<li>Meditation
<ul>
<li><strong>You do not have any issues in life if you&rsquo;re in the present</strong>.</li>
<li>Guide yourself. Two deep breaths will bring you into present.</li>
<li>While breathing out, imagine you throw out (mercilessly and forcefully) the anxieties also.</li>
<li>Prana and mind are connected. One effects the other.</li>
<li><strong>Be aware of the sounds but do not name it</strong> e.g. that is a motor, I know it&hellip; Don&rsquo;t allow that train of thoughts. Without all that movement of the mind you can still be aware of the sound. You&rsquo;ve reached the state of inner silence, as you&rsquo;re aware.</li>
<li>That inner silence is the foundation of life. It&rsquo;s not void, it&rsquo;s full to the brim. You&rsquo;re as a person are not there. That&rsquo;s the <strong>samadhi of the vedantins</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless there is a contrast, you&rsquo;ll not see anything.</li>
<li><strong>When you see things, you start judging the things. Now you&rsquo;ve started your samsara.</strong> Started at the very young age and it will be going on and on. Aindriyaka jivanam - focus on what the sight cognizes. &ldquo;World is full of opposites and god it&rdquo;. Why should he? No, it was you!</li>
<li>Eyesight is like a mirror, not like a camera. It reflects the forms and then forms are erased. You remain clean, free from forms. Where do you want to focus, on the outside of forms with opposites? These opposites bind people.</li>
<li><strong>People are not selling beauty (roses, jewelry, building, art, landscape, tree&hellip;). They are selling ideas!</strong> The quality of the beauty is not out there. People who assume so are living a life of aindriyaka jivanam - in a dream. And all of it will collapse. Beauty is in you. When the mind is silent, the awareful being comes into the fore and there is a beauty in it.</li>
<li>No self-centered activity - activity without seeking anything for one self. It&rsquo;s there in you. Only you have to make it more pronounced. You&rsquo;re not egoistic all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Mind, which has no self-centered activity in it, is the most beautiful thing.</strong></li>
<li>Any time you assume there is joy in the outer it will cheat you, it will prove to you unequivocally that there is no joy in it. Joy is not an attribute of the outer.</li>
<li>Life a life of viveka, viveki jivan, not aindriyaka. Every time you pay the price for sukham with dukham. Stop seeking any sukham and you&rsquo;ll not know what&rsquo;s dukham.</li>
<li>Eyesight is not really drg, it is drshyam. It is not the subject. It can be good / bad. But who is the subject now? Mind.</li>
<li>Seeing means knowing the forms. Hearing mean knowing the sounds.</li>
<li><strong>When you focus on the sounds you&rsquo;re in dvaita. When you focus on the hearing you&rsquo;ve come into the advaita.</strong></li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re aware of the sounds you&rsquo;re listening. When you name the sound and judge it you&rsquo;re hearing.</li>
<li><strong>Music is not in the notes. It is in the silence between the notes. Notes are outside, you hear those notes and in between is the silence and in that silence is the music. R-a-m-a is what I hear. When it is complete there is a silence. And in that silence there is the knowledge of Rama. Silence is not void, it is fullness. It has everything. All knowledge, all joy, all beauty is in you. Satyam-shivam-sundaram.</strong></li>
<li>Fragrance is not outside. Outside is a flower with aromatic volatile oil, which throws out molecules. A few of them enter into your nose and create the joy of fragrance in the receptors in your nose. Same for skin. Important only: nama &amp; rupa. All sense work in the same way.</li>
<li>Sweetness is in the tongue, not in the object. Therefore do not pay attention to the multiple objects, pay attention to the tongue.</li>
<li>Why should you drink sweet drinks? It&rsquo;s not worth drinking. Water is.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuu7ycuz0qae"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU7YcUZ0qaE">Class 4</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; is already reserved for ideation. When you say it it could be only an &ldquo;idea&rdquo;.</li>
<li>From from &ldquo;namarupa&rdquo; into the thing. That&rsquo;s called study of Vedanta. Everything else is conceptual study. There is no value in it.</li>
<li>Spiritual dimension cannot be introduced in itself. It has to be introduced through the drsya. Provisionally present the psychological dimension as the drg (which it is in reference to the physical) and through it then take you into the higher dimension. That&rsquo;s the job of the speaker, that can be done only with cooperation with the student.</li>
<li><strong>Mind is the stepping stone into the spirit.</strong></li>
<li>Mind is not one thing. It&rsquo;s a bag.</li>
<li>Waking consciousness is the background of the mind&rsquo;s movement.</li>
<li><strong>The brain has two lobes. One is intellect, the other deals with emotions and is called mind.</strong></li>
<li>If you look at your consciousness you can clearly notice how it is moving. In there there is kama (desires). It becomes a habit with people and they cannot live in comfort. Always uneasy or disturbed, because something or the other is missing. Where ever you put them, they complain.</li>
<li>Instead of teaching simplicity the religion teaches desires.</li>
<li>If you give a freedom to the mind it has a set of questions. And if answer is given you feel very happy. There is a joy in it.</li>
<li>Tamasi dhrtih is all about eating. Rajasi about ambition.</li>
<li>Accumulated knowledge will disintegrate, not understanding. Learning is accumulation.</li>
<li>When you psychologically depend on the other person, you&rsquo;re insecure. What will happen when the other person doesn&rsquo;t oblige? When you&rsquo;re dependent on the money, you&rsquo;ll become very insecure when you lose it.</li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;m giving up this and I&rsquo;m ready for whatever consequence. Then you&rsquo;re ready for sanyasa. Retirement, 401k funds, insurance are all born from the sense of insecurity.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;ve to examine whether you&rsquo;ve that sense of insecurity in you. Am I afraid of death? Illness? Maybe yes. That means there is some identification. I have to work on it. Are you afraid when you&rsquo;re alone? No. Good, you&rsquo;re not psychologically dependent on somebody.</strong> That&rsquo;s the book of your mind, that you&rsquo;ve to read.</li>
<li>Real is in you. And the mind is there as a gatekeeper, that doesn&rsquo;t allow you to embrace the reality. <strong>You&rsquo;re that already. But you don&rsquo;t feel it. You don&rsquo;t feel that divinity, fullness. Ask yourself: Do I feel inadequate?</strong> That&rsquo;s the fullness. Actually it&rsquo;s more negative. You do not feel insecurity, you feel love for all. Even you love the door to the point that you don&rsquo;t bang it. You just close it carefully. You love a paper, you don&rsquo;t want to waste it. When you love this insentient objects, what to speak of people? Including those, who throw some dust on you. That&rsquo;s divinity. <strong>YOU HAVE TO FEEL IT, IT IS NOT INTELLECTUAL. That doesn&rsquo;t serve much purpose.</strong></li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t feel the brahmanhood only because the mind is making too much noise. Just like clouds are enough to cover the sun. Mind veils your swarupa.</li>
<li>Love is not sentimentality, love is not attachment. Dismiss all sentimentality, attachment, aversion and all those things and then you come to love. You feel love. Feel it to all. You feel the sense of love towards a friend and towards a foe equally. That love is brahman.</li>
<li>Mind is not chetana. It is physical, material. Mirror is the sand only that was heated to few thousand degrees. Body and mind are of the same material. Mind is very subtle. Yet it is physical thing. A machine. Mind also moves and produces thoughts. <strong>Mind is the machine of thought process.</strong></li>
<li>Suppose you look at yourself notice a flow of thoughts. That&rsquo;s the mind. Suppose you notice there is no thought. Who knows that there is no thought. Are you not aware of the thoughtless state of mind? The thoughtlessness, the gap between a thought and another is with you. When you sneeze, you don&rsquo;t think. If you pay attention to something, the thought comes to an end. And then comes again. <strong>To whom is known the thought process. Watch your mind. Stand apart from it and understand it.</strong></li>
<li>Develop the space of being aware of the thoughts/emotions. That means you&rsquo;re already free from it. You&rsquo;ve stepped back. <strong>Who&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s free from it? The one who&rsquo;s aware of it!</strong></li>

<li><strong>Our greed is the investment for the corporate world.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Just be totally devoted to the job. Forget about corporate people pushing their ways etc.</li>
<li>Stop finding scapegoats, always look within.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>God bless him.
<ul>
<li>If he&rsquo;s right, I learned something about me and I&rsquo;ve got something to correct.</li>
<li>If he&rsquo;s wrong, thank god he&rsquo;s wrong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Face all the challenges with courage. <strong>You&rsquo;d never appeal to the outside, man or god, but to the god who&rsquo;s in you.</strong> He&rsquo;s listening to you and always watching you. He&rsquo;s atma, sakshi he&rsquo;s. Appeal to the inner sakshi and take blessing from him and move forward.</li>
<li>Seeing Niagara on the Internet is just nama rupa. You must see and lose yourself in the seeing. That seeing is brahman. The fact, the truth of seeing is brahman. The seer seen superimposition is samsara. Therefore you&rsquo;ve to go to Niagara. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you&rsquo;ve done it, it&rsquo;s always new. It&rsquo;s always for the first time. Meet anything and everything fresh! The number doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s memory, unreal.
<ul>
<li>Few drops of rain on my head I consider a great blessing. In that raindrop I see the origin of all the oceans of the world.</li>
<li>Life is always fresh, we only look at it through the prism of the memory and then it becomes stale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I look at the jealousy. It&rsquo;s very familiar for all of us. I&rsquo;m aware of it, without condemnation. It&rsquo;s natural consequence of comparison, of the way we&rsquo;ve been brought up. It&rsquo;s not a crime. And that I see that it hurts myself and goes against the vision of Vedanta. Jealousy has no meaning,</strong> I learn a lesson. This is not accumulative knowledge. From then on I&rsquo;m not feeling jealous.
<ul>
<li>What you learn is not accumulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seeking: substitute seeking with striving and everything will be all-right. Generally people are not earnest. They are just seekers. By habit.</li>
<li>Two kinds of impurities of the mind. Sakashaya dosha - jealousy, anger, etc. Nishkashaya dosha - hyperactivity of the mind, restlessness. You cannot sit for 5 minutes. Simple pranayama will help.
<ul>
<li>Give up multitasking. Be devoted to one task at the time.</li>
<li>Multitasking will not increase productivity. It compromises productivity.</li>
</ul>

<li>Religion is belief, philosophy is rational thinking. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUnCgTyqboo&amp;list=PLd6RYR-zr5hFheEjd_0ZjTyCLpbLCMScU">Bhakta &amp; Bhakti</a> talks.

<li>easy vs. difficult</li>

<li>Idea that Pujaswami will take birth again is not correct. Atma is the same for all. The only difference is that a mahatma knows it.</li>

They are more dharmic than us.</strong> They are certain elements of dharma in us that they don&rsquo;t have. <strong>They are more catholic than us. Future generations are already safe. Only we&rsquo;re not safe yet. We have to pay attention to ourselves.</strong></li>
<li>&ldquo;Sun illuminates everything&rdquo;. You cannot say that. There is no doing on the part of the sun. It just is. When the sun is, everything gets illuminated. &ldquo;Sun illuminates&rdquo; is also not correct. <strong>Illumination is not an action (sun doesn&rsquo;t take a broomstick and removes the darkness). &ldquo;Sun is the shining&rdquo;. Sun is the light. Nothing more, no verb there.</strong> Same for brahman.</li>
<li>A wrong question cannot be answered, it can be only seen/understood as a wrong question.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re waiting for something, it can be only death.</li>
<li>Vedantins love death, mrtyuh. Brahmavidyacarya - kathopanishad.</li>

<li>Who am I? It&rsquo;s a query without an answer. All answers which are but conclusions are merely conditioned responses. Just ignore them, they have no value. Only the query has value.</li>

<ul>
<li>Singularity. Time is the byproduct of creation.</li>
<li>A believing person is a not a thinking person.</li>
<li>People are like children. They want children. And they believe the stories wholeheartedly.</li>
<li><strong>People live superficially. They believe. Asking questions makes you go into the depths of consciousness and investigate.</strong> Living on the surface makes us very agitated. That&rsquo;s the movement of the mind. Like a cork on a water with a lot of disturbance.</li>
<li><strong>When you look at the mind are you not already free from the limitations of mind?</strong></li>
<li>I notice my limitation. Lo behold, <strong>I&rsquo;m aware of my limitation. And you should not condemn it, if you do you&rsquo;ve lost the game. So I&rsquo;m free of that limitation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The entire movement of the mind is an object. Don&rsquo;t give the mistake of giving it the status of the subject.</strong></li>
<li>I&rsquo;m observing but without being an observer. Otherwise I&rsquo;m an egotistic observer. Observing and judging, justifying, assessing, evaluating, condemning. Do you know <strong>how ego operates? It condemns what it observes.</strong> Example: somebody tells I&rsquo;m an idiot. Will I become an idiot only because somebody says so? <strong>When you observe, you&rsquo;ll not get hurt.</strong></li>
<li>Alert is same as aware. Alert means ego is not there.</li>
<li>Observation without condemnation. Means without ID. That is the definition of awareness. Awareness brings understanding. Justification, ID, condemnation &hellip; there is no understanding. If you have understanding, there is no frustration.</li>
<li>When Rama met Ravana for the first time he gave him a piece of advice. &ldquo;Nothing is lost, release Sita, go home and live a long life&rdquo;. There is no enmity.</li>
<li>There is <strong>no end in view.</strong> No &ldquo;let me be aware to get moksha in three months&rdquo;. Just trust the process. <strong>You&rsquo;re focused on the process, not on the end.</strong></li>
<li>Awareness is not self-improvement. The egoistic self is the false self. Don&rsquo;t bring drg drsya viveka to the level of psychology. In psychology the mind is real. Here only atma is real. On the contrary it is the end of the small &ldquo;me&rdquo; which is there in the braincells. You don&rsquo;t find this &ldquo;me&rdquo; in no other part of the body but braincells. Don&rsquo;t be head people (kundalini goes to the head). Be heart people.</li>
<li>Ego holds memory. That&rsquo;s why when the braincells become weak, memory is lost.</li>
<li>Krishna: &ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re pursuing moksha you&rsquo;ll not get it&rdquo;</li>
<li>As long as you take yourself as a person, guru be a person. And god will be another person. You&rsquo;re not a person, but tattvam. So is guru, so is Ishvara.</li>
<li><strong>What is world? It is not relative to your senses and mind? It is mithya. Minus senses and mind where is the world? How can you call jagat real.</strong></li>
<li>Sakshi: that which sees without any means for seeing. You see the mind, you see yourself without any means. Sun illuminates everything else. And shines by itself. You know the world by light and the sun is light. We don&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;illuminates itself&rdquo;. There is no action.</li>
<li>In the awareness there is no becoming. There is only mere silent observation.</li>
