<h2 id="part-1-2">Part 1, 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Teaching from the Gita is more practical as that of Upanishad. Closer to the ordinary life.</li>
<li>The body is the chariot. Arjuna is the master of the chariot. You&rsquo;re Arjuna.</li>
<li>Be clean. Be frank. Be like an open book. One who&rsquo;s like that is Arjuna. No crookedness, no crafty-ness, innocence.</li>
<li>The tree is called Arjuna because it soars straight into the sky.</li>
<li>If you keep a distance between you and the teaching, you&rsquo;ll be quoting Gita, not living Gita.</li>
<li>There is no outside enemies. You&rsquo;re (thoughts, qualities of head and heart) your own enemy.</li>
<li>Ideation is not knowledge, idea is not the truth.</li>
<li>Kama is an attitude of desiring and people are addicted to it. Constantly desiring one thing or the other. It becomes a habit. But it cannot withstand the scorching of examination, knowledge. Similarly krodha, mada (arrogance).</li>
<li>In Sanskrit life is called prAna. pra-ana. Movement. Life is that which makes all this movement, functions possible.</li>
<li>Love is not of the mind, attachment is. Love, peace, bliss are from a deeper source.</li>
<li>Happiness has an opposite. Bliss not.</li>
<li>That peace nobody can disturb once you discover it. Nobody can assail it.</li>
<li>Imagine somebody tells a good joke. You&rsquo;re laughing heartily. You as a person will not be there.</li>
<li>Love is unknown, but not inaccessible. It is supremely accessible but you cannot know it. And you come to it by discarding the known. Love cannot be discovered by a mind full of the known.</li>
<li>When you say to a person &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t love the person. You want to possess, hold the person. When you try to do it, you&rsquo;ll get jealousy if you believe the person is possessing by somebody else.</li>
<li>Also, love is not a sentiment. To be sentimental is the same as being emotional. Emotionalism is but a sensation.</li>
<li>If you see somebody dancing (as love of god) suspect the person right away.</li>
<li>A sentimental person cannot know what is love because the sentiment will turn it in opposite direction.</li>
<li>In bhakti you&rsquo;re very calm and quiet. And that quietude expresses in the body outside and inside (mind is resolved), so that you abide as the awareful being. Love is the fragrance of that awareful being. That love is called bhaktih.</li>
<li>If Lord Krishna would be standing here in front of us you&rsquo;d consider him escaped from a drama company.</li>
<li>Concentrating on form you have to struggle to make it happen. To concentrate on space you need not only give up. It is so easy.</li>
<li>Be aware that you&rsquo;re in embrace of this power.</li>
<li>When you retain your persona and want to love that already is the denial of love.</li>
<li>Gita bhasya is very tough, brahmasutra the opposite.</li>
<li>Samsari: I love the rose. Bhakti: I love the glory of Ishvara that is in the rose. Ravana being a criminal doesn&rsquo;t prevent Rama from seeing the glory of Ishvara in him. You&rsquo;d be able to see the glory of Ishvara in everything, thus loving everything because everything is a conduit through which the glory of Ishvara is becoming abundantly clear, recognizable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="part-3-4">Part 3, 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Evidence -&gt; existence -&gt; nama rupa. Works better with nose, ears than with eyes - the progression is too fast. We&rsquo;re so attached to nama rupa (last step) that we miss the first two.</li>
<li>It exists, therefore it is evident. Vasu (asti) deva (bhati). That astibhati is Ishvara, that is called Vasudeva.</li>
<li>You cognize nama rupa, but learn to be aware of the presence.</li>
<li>You can feel the presence with closed eyes (touch) more easily.</li>
<li>Water&rsquo;s specific gravity is 1, body 1.9. If only people remain calm, they will not sink.</li>
<li>Bhakti: feeling and recognising the presence of Ishvara in all of the things. Deva (Vasudeva) is the feeling.</li>
<li>Be always conscious of the blissful and real aspect of the five elements.</li>
<li>Water is also called sa:jivanam. It is life.</li>
<li>While you&rsquo;re inhaling, there is bliss. When you&rsquo;re exhaling, there is a small anxiety. By inhaling you can feel the power of life, by exhaling the power of death.</li>
<li>Space represents the power of gravity.</li>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t you accept a tree, piece of stone, river, cow, dog, kid, any human &hellip; as divinity?</li>
<li>Learn to give up the nama rupa.</li>
<li>Mental form - criminal. Physical form - human.</li>
<li>You have to rise above the forms, the words, the syllables to get the meaning. Similarly you&rsquo;ve to rise above the forms of idols etc. to get the divinity.</li>
<li>Divine vision: you visualize Isvhara everywhere and Ishavara only and none other that Ishavara. You&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the divine bliss anywhere and at any time. The whole world becomes the temple of god. Whatever you do becomes worship. That&rsquo;s ananyabhakti.</li>
<li>Vishvarupa: any head on the earth is Isvhara&rsquo;s head. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s infinite. Every life form is his manifestation. That&rsquo;s why no himsa. It is more then ethics and morals. It is the divine vision that stops you from hurting another life form.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="class-5-6">Class 5, 6</h1>
<ul>
<li>Believers will be always insecure unless they have some other believers around. That&rsquo;s why they seek to convert people. They see security in numbers.</li>
<li>One iota of experience is superior to a ton of precept.</li>
<li>Pick one idea and live it. A living idea is superior to a ton of precept.</li>
<li>SakshatkAra: I&rsquo;m because I&rsquo;m, not because I see, not because I think.</li>
<li>In the thinking of a devotee god is always compassionate. Because the devotee needs compassion.</li>
<li>Common aim of the upasana is to abolish the diversity of names of form.</li>
<li>To discover brahman in the worldly objects and also in yourself. So we don&rsquo;t look at phrtivi as a means of sense gratification.</li>
<li>If you love, there is no one that loves apart from the feeling of love. If the person is there that is cupidity.</li>
<li>Desirelessness doesn&rsquo;t belong. Desire belongs (to the small self). As it (desire/fear) springs up it brings above the person.</li>
<li>Even after thinking for 10 minutes I don&rsquo;t find something to desire. Be like that!</li>
<li>There is no fear means there is no person. It means you&rsquo;re merged into divine vision.</li>
<li>Wanting a heaven in future means you&rsquo;re currently living in the hell. Looking for it will convert the present to hell. Heaven in future = credit in future religion. We want cash religion = bliss now and here.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not talking. Talking happens. Mahatmas talk. You&rsquo;ve got a problem with the vision? Go and complain to Sri Krishna or Shankara.</li>
<li>If you have 10 rupees you can give 1/2 to a person and the other to somebody else. You can give the same amount of love to one person and to the other. It is infinite, it is like space. It is a fragrance of the being. The appreciation for the chaitanyam/life everywhere.</li>
