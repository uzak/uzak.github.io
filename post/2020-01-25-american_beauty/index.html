I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what it is but I know didn&rsquo;t always feel this sedated. But you know what? It&rsquo;s never too late to get it back.</p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s the weirdest thing. I feel like I&rsquo;ve been in a coma for about 20 years and I&rsquo;m just now waking up.</p></li><li><p>&mldr; retiring to the men&rsquo;s room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a life that doesn&rsquo;t so closely remember hell.</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of denial.</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;m just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;ve got that [frozen] homeless woman on videotape. Why would you film that? Because it was amazing. What&rsquo;s amazing about it? When you see something like that, it&rsquo;s like God is looking right at you just for a second. And if you are careful, you can look right back. And what do you see? Beauty.</p></li><li><p>That&rsquo;s the day where I realised that there was this entire life behind things. And this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know that there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.</p></li><li><p>Video&rsquo;s a poor excuse. I know. But it helps me remember. I need to remember. Sometimes there is so much &mldr; beauty &mldr; in the world. I feel like I can&rsquo;t take it. My heart is just going to cave in.</p></li><li><p>This isn&rsquo;t life. This is stuff. And it has become more important to you than living.</p></li><li><p>Today is the first day of the rest of your life.</p></li><li><p>No, no. You don&rsquo;t get to tell me what to do ever again.</p></li><li><p>Me-centered living.</p></li><li><p>I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me but it&rsquo;s so hard to stay mad when there is so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m seeing it all at once and it is too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that&rsquo;s about to burst. And then I remember to relax and stop trying to hold on to it. And then it flows through me like rain, and I can&rsquo;t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life. You have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about, I&rsquo;m sure. But don&rsquo;t worry. You will someday.</p></li><li><p>The Beatles - Because:</p><p>Because the world is round it turns me on<br>Because the world is round, ah</p><p>Because the wind is high it blows my mind<br>Because the wind is high, ah</p><p>Love is old, love is new<br>Love is all, love is you</p><p>Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry<br>Because the sky is blue, ah</p><p>Ah, ah, ah,ah</p></li></ul><p>Ultimate song name from OST: <em>Still dead</em></p><hr><ul><li>still - without movement, without noise (de), calm</li><li>still - eternal, always, persistent</li></ul><p>still = truth = infinity = being</p><p>sanskrit root: <a href="https://youtu.be/W-A9z2xWWh8?t=890">sthA</a></p><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
