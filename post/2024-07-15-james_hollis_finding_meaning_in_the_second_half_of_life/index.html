fabulous descent into the underworld with the recognition that midway in life he found himself in a dark wood, having lost his way.</li><li>Aeschylus, the first great tragedian, observed that gods ordained a solemn decree that from <strong>suffering alone comes wisdom.</strong></li><li>Using the words soul and psyche interchangeably.</li><li>Mystery in which our journey plays out:<ol><li>the immense cosmos through which we are flung at warp velocity,</li><li>ambient nature, which is our home and our context,</li><li>each proximate other who brings the challenge of relationship, and</li><li>our own elusive, insurgent Self, forever asking, insisting, not to be forgotten.</li></ol></li><li>A life that constricts meaning wounds the soul</li><li>Jung: &ldquo;<strong>Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore equivalent to illness.</strong> Meaning makes a great many things endurable - perhaps everything.</li><li>Jung once observed that one can travel no further with another than one has traveled on one&rsquo;s own.</li><li>inexplicably, <strong>it is the soul itself that has brought us to that difficult place in order to enlarge us.</strong></li><li><strong>individuation, that is, the lifelong project of becoming more nearly the whole person we were meant to be - what the gods intended, not the parents, or the tribe, or especially, the easily intimidated or inflated ego.</strong></li><li><strong>The Self is the embodiment of nature&rsquo;s plan for us, or the will of the gods.</strong></li><li>If we are in the service to the Self, we can seldom be in service to the herd as well.</li><li>the process of individuation must lead to more intense and broader collective relationship and not isolation</li><li><strong>In most lives, permission to live one&rsquo;s life is not something one is given; it is to be seized.</strong></li><li><strong>&ldquo;Does this path enlarge or diminish me?&rdquo;</strong> We know the answer intuitively, instinctively, in the gut.</li><li>each of us is obliged to find our personal path through the dark wood. <strong>In the medieval Grail legend the knights, having seen the Grail, and intuiting that it symbolized their search for meaning, undertook to challenge and began their descent into the dark wood. But the text tells us that each one choose a separate place of entry &ldquo;where there was no path, for it is a shameful thing to take the path that someone else has trod before.&rdquo;</strong></li></ul><h2 id=chapter-one-expensive-ghosts-how-did-we-get-to-this-point>Chapter One: Expensive Ghosts: How did we get to this point?</h2><ul><li>Paul Hoover (Theory of Margins): &ldquo;We drag expensive ghosts through memory&rsquo;s unmade bed.&rdquo;</li><li>If we have not had such moments of genuine confusion, perplexity, and doubt, chances are we&rsquo;re simply living on automatic pilot.</li><li><strong>Our greatest sin may be choosing to remain unconscious.</strong></li><li>As Shakespeare observed in Twelfth Night, no prisons are more confining than those we know not we are in.</li><li><strong>the presence of suffering is already manifestation of the psyche at work.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-freedom-of-this-contemporary-hour>The Freedom of This Contemporary Hour</h3><ul><li><strong>A young person can&rsquo;t afford such questions, which threaten to erode the ego&rsquo;s fragile structure. But by midlife, one may finally be strong enough, or desperate enough, to ask these questions in a committed fashion.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=thee-silent-passage-into-the-second-life>Thee Silent Passage into the Second Life</h3><ul><li><strong>Whatever &ldquo;The plan&rdquo; of their lives was, conscious or unconscious, it progressively seemed to not be working too well.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-midlife-crisis>The Midlife Crisis?</h3><ul><li>One has to have separated from the parents long enough to be in the world, to make choices, to see what works, what does not, and to experience the collapse, or at least erosion of one&rsquo;s projections.</li></ul><h3 id=how-it-begins>How It Begins</h3><ul><li>The psyche is always speaking, and its urges will manifest as <strong>ennui, the more conscious boredom, then inner resistance to our conscious scripts, and, as we continue to turn deaf ears, finally as eruption of invasive feelings and behaviours</strong>: interrupted sleep or eating habits, the lure of an affair, troubling dreams, self-medicating addictions, and so on.</li><li>We experience the unavoidable conflict between the natural Self and the acquired &ldquo;sense of self&rdquo;</li><li>The most common characteristic of this kind of passage, is the <strong>deconstruction of &ldquo;the false self&rdquo;.</strong></li><li><strong>It is quite natural to cling to the known world and fear the unknown.</strong></li><li><strong>is it not self-deluding, then to keep doing the same thing but expecting different results?</strong></li><li>As Jung once put it humorously, <strong>we all walk in shoes too small for us.</strong></li><li>The person in the grip of this unconscious agenda cannot see that the outer woman is surrogate for his inner life, which has been neglected these many years. <strong>The problem with the unconscious is that it is unconscious.</strong></li><li>Jung: I&rsquo;ve frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life. They seek position, marriage, reputation, outward success or money, and they remain unhappy and neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking. Such people are usually contained within too narrow a spiritual horizon. Their life has not sufficient content, sufficient meaning. If they are enabled to develop into more spacious personalities, the neurosis generally disappears.</li><li>It is generally through the experience of unsolicited suffering that we grow larger, not because the unexamined life proved easier.</li><li><strong>What we have ignored or denied inwardly will then more likely come out to us as outer fate.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=chapter-two-becoming-who-we-think-we-are>Chapter Two: Becoming Who We Think We Are</h2><ul><li><strong>Garden of Eden: Partaking of the Tree of Life is to abide forever int he world of instinct - whole, connected and living the deepest of rhythms without consciousness. Partaking of the Tree of Knowledge brings the mixed blessing of consciousness.</strong></li><li>The birth is also the birth of neurosis, so to speak, because from that moment on we are in service to twin agendas - the biological and the spiritual drive to develop.</li><li><strong>Twin gremlins of fear and lethargy.</strong></li><li><strong>The way forward threatens death - at the very least, the death of what has been familiar.</strong></li><li>People attack gays for stirring unconscious insecurities about their own sexual identities.</li><li>The daily confrontation with these gremlins of fear and lethargy obliges us to choose between anxiety and depression. <strong>Anxiety will be our companion if we risk the next sage of our journey and depression will be if we do not.</strong></li><li>Yogi Berra: When you come to a fork in the road - take it.</li><li>psychological or <strong>spiritual development always requires a greater capacity in us for the toleration of anxiety and ambiguity.</strong> The capacity to accept this troubled state, abide it, and commit to life, is the moral measure of our maturity.</li><li><strong>Anxiety is an elixir, and depression a sedative.</strong></li><li>Jung: &ldquo;The spirit of evil is fear, negation &mldr; the spirit of regression, who threatens us with bondage to the mother and with dissolution and extinction in the unconscious.&rdquo; <strong>Mother symbolizes the safe and sheltering harbor: the old job, the familiar warm arms, and the same unchallenged, and stultifying, value system.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=why-the-tragic-sense-of-life-matters-to-us>Why the Tragic Sense of Life Matters to Us</h3><ul><li>our ancestors believed that we often &ldquo;offend the gods&rdquo;, that is, violate energic designs of which they are dramatized personifications.</li><li>one possessed by Ares will act out of unreasoned anger, with all its attendant consequences. Accordingly, they believed that by &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the texture of one&rsquo;s life, one can identify the ignored or repressed archetypal powers, the gods offended, and offer homage and compensatory behaviours to them to resolve the balance.</li><li><strong>At birth, each of us handed lens by our family of origin, our culture, our Zeitgeist through which to see the world.</strong></li><li>&ldquo;Right relationship with the gods&rdquo; as a psychological concept means that we harmonize our concious life with the deepest powers that govern the cosmos and course through our own souls.</li><li><strong>(Is not this deepened journey of the soul, in fact, our &ldquo;home&rdquo;?). The tragic sense of life, then is not morbid but rather heroic, for it is a summons to consciousness.</strong></li><li><strong>Who ignores this summons will suffer the wrath of the gods, the splitting of the soul we call neurosis.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=existential-wounding-and-the-programming-of-our-sense-of-self>Existential Wounding and the Programming of Our Sense of Self</h3><ul><li><strong>Magical thinking results from an insufficient ability to differentiate self and world.</strong></li><li>Lacking other &ldquo;readings&rdquo; of the world, it is natural fora child to conclude: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as I&rsquo;m treated&rdquo;.</li></ul><h3 id=the-wound-of-overwhelmment>The Wound of Overwhelmment</h3><ul><li><strong>Given the message that the world is larger, more powerful, we may logically try to evade its potential punitive effect upon us by retreating, procrastinating, hiding out, denying, dissociating.</strong></li><li>I have seen people marry someone they did not love because they felt unable to approach the one they did love, because they had reflexively imbued that other with such transferred powerfulness that they were afraid to approach them.</li><li>The second logical response to overwhelmment is found in our frequent <strong>efforts to seize control of the situation.</strong></li><li>&ldquo;The world is hurtful and invasive. You must hurt or invade first, or be hurt and invaded instead&rdquo;.</li><li><strong>We may pursue education, because to understand is to be in control</strong>&mldr;</li><li>Their <strong>urgent desire for power is a measure of their inner powerlessness.</strong></li><li><strong>Accommodation</strong> is a learned response, sometimes even necessary for civilization to survive.</li><li>We say someone is &ldquo;sweet,&rdquo; &ldquo;personable,&rdquo; &ldquo;amiable,&rdquo; &ldquo;easygoing,&rdquo; and most often &ldquo;nice.&rdquo; When these labels repeatedly apply to someone&rsquo;s behaviour the consequences to the person&rsquo;s inner life may be in fact ugly.</li><li><strong>Codependence is predicated on one&rsquo;s reflexive assumption of powerlessness</strong> and the inordinate power of the other.</li><li>Learning to find one&rsquo;s own truth, to hold it, to negotiate with others seems easy enough on paper.</li></ul><h3 id=the-wound-of-insufficiency>The Wound of Insufficiency</h3><ul><li><strong>the unconscious equation is &ldquo;I am as I am treated by others&rdquo;.</strong></li><li>something in us does dream, and brings an invitation to consciousness, to risk embodying a larger sense of self.</li><li><strong>what one lacks within one will seek in the outer world.</strong></li><li>How many marriages are in the service to the hidden agenda of the less psychologically evolved of the two?</li><li>Narcissist work very hard to conceal their inner poverty from recognition by others.<ul><li><strong>sense of self is predicted upon emptiness</strong>, derives from early childhood neglect or insufficient mirroring</li><li>any argument or disappointment with them will always prove to be your fault and not their responsibility</li></ul></li><li>Fate dominates destiny, history dictates future</li><li>Food, for example, is especially prone to receive the projections of perceived loss and gain.</li><li><strong>Any reflexive response to stress and anxiety, whether conscious or not, is a form of addiction. The chief motive of any addiction is, of course, to help one not feel what in fact one has already been feeling. Breaking the tyranny of the addiction will require one to feel the pain that the addiction defends against.</strong></li><li>Whenever we&rsquo;re fatigued, stressed, or whenever conscious control is lessened, these old patterns are especially prone to reactivation.</li><li><strong>Seldom are we wholly present to this moment, this ever-new reality, without interference of the past.</strong><ul><li>Faulkner: <strong>past is not dead; it is not even past</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>No freedom is possible, no authentic choice, where consciousness is lacking. Paradoxically, consciousness usually only comes from the experience of suffering.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=chapter-three-the-collision-of-selves>Chapter Three: The collision of Selves</h2><ul><li>It is far easier to talk in the shoes too small for us than to step into the largeness that the soul expects and demands.</li><li>Most of us are brought into therapy on our knees, or at best in a state of disorientation.</li><li><strong>A formal, committed therapeutic relationship provides a deeper, more objective, more informed conversation with oneself, through the engagement of another person who has our interest at heart.</strong></li><li>The invitation to meet oneself is seldom if ever solicited; it is rather brought on by outer or inner events that force one to question who one is, and in service to what values.</li><li>None of us is pleased to encounter the <strong>false self, the necessary fictions in which we invest, until even we can no longer believe them.</strong></li><li>Perhaps 95 percent of our daily functioning is reflective</li><li>Come to live his life as a <strong>conscious, self-examining being.</strong></li><li><strong>The ego wishes comfort, security, satiety; the soul demands meaning, struggle, becoming.</strong></li><li><strong>Stronger soul seek therapy, the more damaged seek someone to blame.</strong></li><li>He had to complain about his wife, not to look at himself.</li></ul><h3 id=depressions-therapeutic-gift>Depression&rsquo;s Therapeutic Gift</h3><ul><li><strong>Grieving is an honest affirmation of the value of the original investment of energy.</strong> No grief, no true investment occurred.</li><li>Many people in therapy have learned that <strong>the way out of a depression is through it, asking not what I, the ego consciousness, want, but what the soul wants.</strong> Only the reorienting conscious energies in service to other values will lift the depression.</li><li>Anxiety must be chosen over depression, for it is developmental and depression is regressive.</li><li>Need to differentiate the forms of depression; namely, does it come from a biological base, a reaction to loss, or an intrapsychic conflict that, becoming conscious, has great information for us about the next stage of our journey.</li></ul><h3 id=relationship-as-field-of-fire>Relationship As Field of Fire</h3><ul><li><strong>the field of outer relationship is always troubled when we are troubled within.</strong></li><li><strong>it is much easier to blame our partners, or try to reform them, or leave them.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=projections-eroded-projections-renewed>Projections Eroded, Projections Renewed?</h3><ul><li>Projections always pass through five identifiable stages:<ol><li>At the onset they feel magical; they literally alter our sense of reality. We are seeing some unknown part of ourselves in the exterior world</li><li>The second stage begets disillusionment. The other does not carry through as expected.</li><li>We begin to do whatever we can to reinforce the projection, to recover its pristine attraction.</li><li>To suffer the withdrawal of the projection.</li><li>if we reach this point at all, is to become that a projection has occurred.</li></ol></li><li>Every failed projection is quantum of energy, our energy, an agenda for growth or healing, and a task that has come back to us.</li></ul><h3 id=jobs-abrogated-contract>Job&rsquo;s Abrogated Contract</h3><ul><li><strong>a deal is a presumption of the ego in service to its now familiar agenda, which promotes its own security, satiety, and continuity.</strong></li><li>Robert Frost: <em>Forgive, O Lord, my little joke on thee, And I&rsquo;ll forgive thy great big one on me.</em></li><li><strong>This betrayal by the other</strong> - by God, by our lover, by our friend, by the corporation - <strong>is a betrayal of our hope that the world might be manageable and predictable</strong>.</li><li>our presumptive <strong>contracts are delusory efforts by the ego to be in control</strong>.</li><li>The world is more magical, less predictable, more autonomous, less controllable, more varied, less simple, more infinite, less knowable, more wonderfully troubling than we could have imagined being able to tolerate when we were young.</li></ul><h3 id=competing-agendas>Competing Agendas</h3><ul><li>If <strong>the agenda of the first half of life is social, meeting the demands and expectations our milieu asks of us,</strong> then <strong>the questions of the second half of life are spiritual, addressing the larger issues of the meaning</strong>.</li><li><strong>The psychology of the first half of life is driven by the fantasy of acquisition.</strong></li><li><strong>When the ego prevails, change is forestalled, and spiritual stagnation, even regression, sooner or later occurs.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=chapter-four-barriers-to-transformation>Chapter Four: Barriers to Transformation</h2><ul><li>W. H. Auden (The Age of Anxiety): &ldquo;We would rather be ruined than changed, We would rather die in our dread Than climb the cross of the present And let our illusions die.&rdquo;</li><li>we must recall that the <strong>central, universal message of the world to the child is: &ldquo;I am big and you&rsquo;re not; I am powerful and you&rsquo;re not; now find a way to deal with that.&rdquo; Whatever stratagem we evolve &ndash; approach/avoidance; trust/distrust; fight/flight; control/placate &ndash; has a tendency to get locked in as a core relational paradigm for self and world, a reflexive strategy for survival and means for getting one&rsquo;s needs met.</strong></li><li>It is essential that we not judge ourselves, for we cannot be blamed for choices we made as children.</li><li><strong>A complex is a cluster of energy in the unconscious, charged by historic events, reinforced through repetition, and generating a programmed response and an implicit set of expectations.</strong></li><li>Folk wisdom has long recognized the presence and power of complexes in such homey sayings as, &ldquo;Count twenty before you say something&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Write the letter but wait a week before you send it.&rdquo;</li><li>If I&rsquo;m not my ego state, then who am I?</li><li><strong>when a complex is at work, there is always some seizing up of the body - a constricted throat, flutter in the stomach, sweating palms</strong></li><li>A complex takes place when an unconscious stimulus is received.</li><li>historically generated but invisible clusters of energy are activated over and over that patterns <strong>(complexes) form in our lives, patterns which seemingly have a life of their own and are seldom consciously chosen. For this reason, our ancestors speculated that the hand of an offended divinity was at work.</strong></li><li>A person in the first half of life is so swarming with the power of these unconscious forces</li><li><strong>Zen saying: &ldquo;Everywhere you go, there you are.&rdquo;</strong></li><li>&ldquo;the middle passage&rdquo; occurs only when a person begins to discern that his or her repetitions, compensations, and treatment plans for life have their origin not in conscious life but in unconscious history.</li><li>Ixion: the wheel of repetition.</li><li>St Paul: while we may intend the good, we seldom do it.</li><li><strong>lethargy - Lethe, the river of forgetfulness</strong> in the classical topography of the underworld. Forgetting that we are summoned by each moment to make life-defining choices.</li><li>Perhaps to <strong>greatest addictions in our culture do not include street drugs, but are television and food.</strong></li><li>Blaise Pascal noted that popular culture has become a vast divertissement, a <strong>diversion from the engagement with the Self. Even the king had to have his jester</strong>.</li><li>our age, where <strong>lethargy of the spirit</strong> is merchandised by very intelligent people and lulls all of us into the <strong>sleep of reason,</strong> and the <strong>slumber of the spirit.</strong></li><li>Growing up, leaving home, require two practices.<ol><li><strong>we must take responsibility for ourselves, and stop blaming others:</strong> the society, the parents, the partner, the malevolent gods.</li><li><strong>we have to look within to see the repetitive core ideas, the complexes, and the historic influence where the true enemy lies.</strong></li></ol></li><li>Rumi mused: &ldquo;<em>A king sent you to a country to carry one special, specific task. You go to the country and you perform a hundred other tasks, but if you have not performed the task you were sent for, it is as if you have performed nothing at all. So man has come into the world for a particular task and that is his purpose. If he doesn&rsquo;t perfdorm it, he will have done nothing.</em>&rdquo;</li></ul><h2 id=chapter-five-the-dynamics-of-intimate-relationship>Chapter Five: The Dynamics of Intimate Relationship</h2><ul><li>Rumi (&ldquo;Sometimes I Forget&rdquo;): &ldquo;<em>Sometimes I forget completely What companionship is. Unconscious and insane, I spill sad energy everywhere.</em>&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Of all the ideologies that possess the contemporary soul, perhaps none is more powerful, more seductive, and possibly more delusory than the romantic fantasy that there is someone out there who is right for us, the long-sought soul mate, what I call &ldquo;the magical other&rdquo;, the one who will truly understand us, take care of us, meet our needs, repair the wounds, and, with a little luck, spare us the burden of growing up and meeting our own needs.</strong></li><li><strong>its chief rival: the fantasy that material goods will bring us happiness.</strong></li><li><strong>In earlier epochs the notion that one might find fulfillment in this life was considered laughable, even impious. This world, our predecessors believed, was a &ldquo;vale of tears&rdquo; and could only be compensated by an afterlife.</strong></li><li><strong>It is far easier to be disappointed in the other than to call ourselves to account.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=the-psychodynamics-of-relationship>The Psychodynamics of Relationship</h3><ul><li><strong>All relationships begin in projection.</strong></li><li>As historically charged creatures, we have a tendency to transfer those historical patterns, and their predicable outcomes, into every new relationship.</li><li>Either <strong>choice is dictated by the unmetabolized events of the childhood.</strong></li><li>If we are sincere, and really do wish to <strong>improve relationships</strong>, as so many popular books and magazines claim, we may usefully <strong>ask: &ldquo;What do we project, and what do we transfer onto the other person?&rdquo;</strong></li><li>An <strong>imago is a very deeply charged image.</strong></li><li><strong>Our intrapsychic imago of the beloved other will most commonly have been shaped by our most primal experiences of relationships.
