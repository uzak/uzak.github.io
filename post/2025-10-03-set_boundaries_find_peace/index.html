It took years for me to realize that I was not helping people by &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; them.</li><li><strong>Clarity saves relationships.</strong></li><li>Communicating what you want and need is tough at first. And dealing with what comes after can be downright uncomfortable. But the more you do it, the easier it gets, especially when you experience the peace of mind that follows.</li><li>Reasons people don&rsquo;t respect your boundaries:<ul><li><strong>You don&rsquo;t take yourself seriously</strong></li><li><strong>You don&rsquo;t hold people accountable</strong></li><li><strong>You apologize for setting boundaries</strong></li><li><strong>You allow too much flexibility</strong></li><li><strong>You speak in uncertain terms</strong></li><li><strong>You haven&rsquo;t verbalized your boundaries (they&rsquo;re all in your head)</strong></li><li><strong>You assume that stating your boundaries once is enough.</strong></li><li><strong>You assume that people will figure out what you want and need based on how you act when they violate a boundary.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=part-1-understanding-the-importance-of-boundaries>Part 1: Understanding the importance of boundaries</h2><h2 id=1-what-the-heck-are-boundaries>1.

They require an awareness of your emotional, mental and physical capacities, combined with clear communication. They look like:<ul><li>being clear about your values</li><li>listening to your own opinion</li><li>sharing with others appropriately</li><li>having a healthy relationship with people who have earned your trust</li><li>being comfortable saying no</li><li>being comfortable hearing no without taking it personally</li></ul></li><li>Saying no without apologizing because it&rsquo;s the healthiest choice for you at the moment</li></ul><h3 id=two-parts-to-setting-boundaries>Two parts to setting boundaries</h3><ul><li>short-term discomfort for a long-term healthy relationship is worth it every time.</li><li>Whenever you identify a boundary you&rsquo;d like to set, remember that there are two steps to the process: communication and action.</li></ul><h4 id=communication>Communication</h4><ul><li><strong>People cannot accurately assume your boundaries based on your body language or unspoken expectations. When you explicitly state what you expect, there is little room for others to misinterpret what works for you. Assertive statements are the most effective way to do this.</strong></li><li>Example:<ul><li><em>When we have a disagreement, I&rsquo;d like you to use a lower tone and take a break if you feel like you&rsquo;re getting too heated in the argument. Also, I will mention when I&rsquo;m becoming uncomfortable with your tone.</em></li><li><em>It&rsquo;s important to me that you honor plans that we set up.

Name it: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re testing my limits&rdquo;. Express how testing your boundaries makes you feel.</strong></li><li><strong>Do your best to name your boundary without offering an explanation so that you&rsquo;re not talked out of it.</strong></li></ul><h4 id=ignoring>Ignoring</h4><ul><li>passive-aggressive way of pretending they didn&rsquo;t hear them</li><li>resentment build, over time this erodes respect in the relationship.</li><li>How to handle: <strong>react to ignoring immediately after you notice the issue.

You have to look out for yourself</strong> - no excuses required.</li><li>How to handle: <strong>be careful not to explain yourself. Keep your response short by saying something like this: &ldquo;This is what&rsquo;s healthy for me.&rdquo; Saying too much will put you in a back-and-forth negotiation.</strong></li></ul><h4 id=defensiveness>Defensiveness</h4><ul><li><strong>being clear in our wording helps minimize defensiveness.</strong></li><li>Defensively, people will turn the issue on you because they don&rsquo;t want to be at fault.</li><li>Defensive people aren&rsquo;t listening while you&rsquo;re talking; they&rsquo;re personalizing what you say and crafting a response.</li><li>How to talk to people when they&rsquo;re being defensive:<ul><li>Make it about yourself, not them. Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements.</li><li>Talk about one issue at a time.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t talk about old issues with this person while stating your boundary.</strong></li><li>Use &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; words, such as &ldquo;When you &mldr;.&rdquo;, I feel &ldquo;&mldr;.&rdquo;.</li><li><strong>Say something in the moment or soon after.</strong> Don&rsquo;t let issues fester for days, weeks, or months.</li><li>When you feel you won&rsquo;t be able to set the boundary face-to-face, set it by any means necessary.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=ghosting>Ghosting</h4><ul><li>Ending things without explaining or disappearing is often called &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo; and is an unhealthy response to boundaries.</li><li>How to handle:</li><li><strong>Send a precise text message or email mentioning the behaviour you&rsquo;re noticing. Express how the ghosting is making you feel and the concerns you have about the relationship. If receiving a response take a few days, be clear how to restate how the ghosting makes you feel. If you don&rsquo;t receive a response, remind yourself that their reaction was not about you.</strong></li></ul><h4 id=silent-treatment>Silent Treatment</h4><ul><li>less extreme than the ghosting but still painful.</li><li>How to handle: <strong>Verbalize what you notice: &ldquo;You seem upset.

Challenge the behaviour of the other person.</strong></li></ul><h4 id=acceptance>Acceptance</h4><ul><li>Boundaries are the cure to most relationship problems.</li><li>Signs of an Unhealthy Relationship:<ul><li>You are unable to express your needs because the other person refuses to listen.</li><li>The other person refuses to meet reasonable requests.</li><li>There&rsquo;s emotional, physical, or sexual abuse.</li><li>You feel sad, angry, drained, or disappointed after most interactions.</li><li>The relationship is one-sided; you give and they take.</li><li>There&rsquo;s lack of trust in the relationship.</li><li>The other person refuses to change some unhealthy behaviours.</li><li>The other person has an addiction that is harmful to you.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=areas-where-we-commonly-need-boundaries>Areas Where we Commonly Need Boundaries</h3><h4 id=family>Family</h4><p>Parents should respect the limits and needs of their children, even when they are young.</p><h4 id=work>Work</h4><p>Limits can help you maintain a healthy work-life harmony.</p><h4 id=romance>Romance</h4><ul><li>When it comes to love, for some reason we all want our partner to read our mind and know everything we want without having to ask.
