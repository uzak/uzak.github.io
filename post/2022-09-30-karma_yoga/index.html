<ul>
<li>When Gita was started, there was dharma, not religions.</li>
<li>In the context of a dharmic civilization worship of Ishvara is called karma.</li>
<li>500 CE something like religious ID started. Before there Christ&rsquo;s teaching were there.</li>
<li>Action is different than work. All natures works. Only humans act. Action is work performed by a human being with a motive.</li>
<li><strong>Vivekananda. Humans are slaves. They don&rsquo;t work like masters. They are slaves to the motives behind their acts. Suppose you erase the motive you&rsquo;ll not be bound. This is what Shri Krishna was teaching. This is what will give you enthusiasm and courage!</strong> No motive and there is no sense of doership nor enjoyership.</li>
<li>Breathing - work. Pranayama - action (maybe to reduce high heartbeat).</li>
<li><strong>One has to work anyway. But you induce motive (desire) into the work.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Origin of action is thought.</strong> Lay emphasis not on the outer (the benefits you&rsquo;ll get), but on the thought. That makes you antarmuhka, otherwise youll remain bahirmukha.</li>
<li>Organised religion fails us because it doesn&rsquo;t allow us to place emphasis on the inner. It pulls you out of yourself and makes you put emphasis on the outer.</li>
<li>Another name for motive is desire for the action.</li>
<li>Action - result - desire for the result - actor (doer). All of that is one movement. Unitary movement. Motivated thought becomes the origin of the action and creates the actor. The me (ego) which is also a thought.</li>
<li>Basic necessities of life are not motives.</li>
<li><strong>In the language of Gita the motiveless thought is called pure.</strong> The very desire is impure. Impurities of the mind begin with &ldquo;kama&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Bondage doesn&rsquo;t depend on being brahmachari, sanjasi, grhasta. Bondage depends on being slave to one&rsquo;s own imagination.</li>
<li><strong>Desire to achieve an end brings about the will, which is the actor.</strong> Which is a process of becoming.</li>
<li>Narendra Modi: the more you throw mud of me the better the lotus blooms.</li>
<li>Our daily life the way we know it is a process of becoming.</li>
<li>Focus on the being, not on the becoming. All you want is in the being. Becoming is a strive, pain, constant battle.</li>
<li>Horizontal vs. vertical movement.</li>
<li><strong>Be totally devoted to the job/duty.</strong> Until the last breath. Don&rsquo;t even think of motive, result, end. This is the devotion. It becomes the offering to the supreme god.</li>
<li><strong>The one who created the body/mind will take care of it</strong>.</li>
<li>Ambition is a poisonous bread. Ambitious person lives for himself.</li>
<li>Human mind has a weakness wanting a yes/no answer. One of such question is about ignorance.</li>
<li>Darkness is. You switch on the light. It is not. Where is is?</li>
<li><strong>In life there are no conclusions, there is only negation. There are no answers. There is only inquiry and it is timeless.</strong></li>
</ul>
