This always involves the diminution of the moral significance of the individual. So we see <strong>with the Protestant Revolution that the faculties of free will are vitiated, and the power of the individual diminished among the vast mass of the elect; so with the French Revolution the individual&rsquo;s role within the state is diminished for the abstraction notion of the citizen; and with the Third Revolution, the means a man&rsquo;s material wellbeing, namely his utilization of property, is diminished following the transformation of property through the industrial revolution. So we see with the Fifth Revolution, with man&rsquo;s individual health becoming something to be sacrificed to the socialized and notional versions of societal health.</strong></li><li><strong>man is at his highest a moral being: He who is able to cognize and choose the course of his life. It is this attribute which makes man distinct from herd animals, his nature and soul that can damn or save him. Such conceptions were first attacked with the Protestant Revolution, the first great socialization of man</strong>, and one conducted against his highest attribute, which is the tutelage of his own soul. This was the first great disorientation of self, and in time for Protestant ruling powers and the subject man no longer saw himself as unique individual cognizable apart from the social order. So it was further <strong>with the Second Revolution, when man&rsquo;s position and his accordant rights within the state were erased with the Declaration of Rights of Man. So it continued with the Third Revolution, when the rights of property, which are the basis for civil government, were etiolated, and his position in the social order made dependent on the will of the industrialist.</strong></li><li>Men&rsquo;s moral rights arise out of his material circumstance.</li><li><strong>All evil is perversion, and the Revolution is nothing but a perversion of the Everlasting and Immanent.</strong></li><li><strong>The modern young person is a monster.</strong></li><li>How to combat this beast of banality? <strong>There is no return to Nature, because man is not natural and never has been, nor ever could be. He is a creature who by definition transforms Nature, who contorts Nature in order to extend his own faculties.</strong> Man is not man without art, if he is not contorting Nature to his will.</li><li><strong>Backwardness in technology is always the rejection of some perfection</strong>, a power of man abjured.</li><li><strong>All men are created as rational souls, with personhood and individuality unfathomable. Yet they accept this great gift of selfhood only reluctantly against the temptation of the herd and of the flesh. It is the cultivation of the individual that must be sought above all, for it is and always has been the end of the Revolution to attack man&rsquo;s individuality.</strong></li><li><strong>The uncritical acceptance of technology is the Revolution in its purest form</strong>. Technology can be used to foster man&rsquo;s individuality and his greatness, but this requires concerted limitations on its use.</li><li><strong>These is no fodder for greatness amongst these herd animals, these beats of caprice who have no ability to rule themselves, these natural slaves who adore their slavery.</strong></li><li><strong>return to God, not as an amorphous force of benevolence or even the creator and protector of the moral order, as the mere social conservative and the modern civil religionist can abide, but as God as He is, God Incarnate, the Word made flesh. For the evil of the present age stands against not only against the nature of Christ as God, but of Christ as man. The Incarnation, the uniting of God and man, was the positive means of our salvation.</strong></li><li>the only right response to God is to adore Him. It is this fundamental response to value which must guide all else. Just as anything in existence must beloved to be fully participated in, just as any greatness, even material greatness, can arse only through love: that any family can be fostered, that any city can be founded, that any civilization can be reformed.</li><li><strong>To properly adore God is to truly love oneself.</strong></li><li><strong>Our society cannot be remade until men are once again recognized as small bastion of the eternal, as warriors in life and soldiers in slaying of death.</strong></li><li>No good government is possible if it does not acknowledge that his <strong>spirit is no free-floating, immaterial thing, but bound in most intimate marriage to material reality through his own flesh.</strong></li><li><strong>Man is a spirit incarnate, dust ennobled by life in God.</strong></li><li>approaching where he is most apparent, tangible to finite sense yet adorable in infinite contemplation: In the Eucharist, where Truth and eternity cannot be deformed, where Being begins and ends, whose reception cannot be simpler but whose heights cannot be surpassed. <strong>It is only here that selfhood can be protected, in the Incarnate Christ where humanity finds the end of the Creature and the wholeness of the Creator, against which the daemon of the Revolution will fall and the Immaculate Heart will triumph.</strong></li></ul><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
