Upon achieving these three realizations, the hair turns gold. This doesn&rsquo;t solve all his problems, but brings new ones.

There is a leak in it somewhere.</li><li>The naive man tends to have an <strong>inappropriate relation to ecstasy. He longs for ecstasy at the wrong time or in the wrong place, and ignores all masculine sources of it. He wants it through the feminine, through Great Mother, through the goddess, even though what may be grounding for the woman ungrounds him.</strong></li><li>The man without limitations may also <strong>specialize in not telling.</strong></li><li>He doesn&rsquo;t know that there is a being in him that wants to remain sick.</li><li>His timing is off.</li><li>There is something in naivete that <strong>demands betrayal.</strong> The naive man will have curious link to betrayal, deceit and lies. Not only he will betray others easily, but when a woman lives with a truly naive man for a while, she feels impersonally impelled to betray him. When there is too much naivete around, the universe has no choice but to crystallize out some betrayal.</li></ul><h3 id=numbness>Numbness</h3><ul><li>A spiritual man may love light, and yet be entirely numb in the chest area.</li><li>A mother&rsquo;s protection, no matter how well intentioned, will not do as a substitute for the father&rsquo;s protection.</li></ul><h3 id=the-story-taking-kitchen-work>The Story: Taking Kitchen Work</h3><ul><li>Go out into the world now and there you&rsquo;ll learn what poverty is.</li></ul><h3 id=katabasis>Katabasis</h3><ul><li>lowliness, associated with water and soul, as height is associated with spirit.</li><li>Drop - ancient Greek called katabasis.

The emphasis is on the consciousness of the fall.</li><li>In a divorce, man&rsquo;s emotional safety may disintegrate.</li><li>Marriage&rsquo;s breakup or breakdown revives the wound.</li><li>Divorce feels for most men like a discharge, as if one had been fired from a task taken on the day of the wedding.</li><li>If the man refuses to be cheered up, and considers all the discomforts to be cunning expression of an isolating would received in early childhood, then the man can use the divorce - like any other serious collapse - as an invitation to go through the door, accept katabasis, immerse himself in the wound, and exit from his old life through it.</li><li>Christ: &ldquo;You shall not get out until have paid the last penny.&rdquo;</li><li>Some power in the psyche arranges a severe katabasis if the man does not know enough to go down on his own.</li><li>Some Sufi groups begin their night-work with a repeated word reminding them of the grief of what they have not done the past year.</li><li>Seeing the dark side of a person close to us is a discipline the descender accepts.</li><li><strong>It is said that in the marriage, the man and women give each other &ldquo;his or her nethermost beast&rdquo; to hold.
