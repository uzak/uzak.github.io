<ul>
<li>Upadesha is instruction. In jnanam there is only instruction, no handing over. Like there is in religion - handing over a mantra. The one instructing you can call <strong>instructor</strong>.</li>
<li>You need not instruct nobody to go to a physician when he&rsquo;s ill. But <strong>when the psyche is ill, nobody will even acknowledge that he&rsquo;s sick</strong>. And when somebody points out that you&rsquo;re sick in the mind, you become angry. Diagnosis: worldliness -&gt; frustration, agitation. The fact that the people become angry shows that they&rsquo;re ill.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological dimension dominates.</strong> If there is a disorder in this area, your physiological dimension never can become safe and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t overdo anything.</strong> It is a curse. Even for shravanam. When you do, manana and niddidhiasanam are given a go-by.</li>
<li>You have to lecture yourself. You have to instruct yourself. Look at yourself, look at the mind, and you give a lecture to the mind. That is the <strong>self-instruction. Watch the movement of your mind, be aware of its entire movement</strong>. Without your effort a silence will enter into you. It is the gateway into the real.</li>
<li><strong>Jnanam - recognising the false as false. You cannot recognise the self. If you recognise it, it becomes the other.</strong></li>
<li>Health - just cessation of roga. Becoming normal. No special benefit.</li>
<li><strong>When there is a disorder in the subtle, the gross becomes the victim.</strong> Medicine for the subtle is <strong>dispassion</strong> (viraga, vayragyam).</li>
<li>How to get the dispassion? First viveka, then vayragyam.</li>
<li><strong>Inquire</strong>. Woman might not inquire. Man should inquire. Why should men inquire. Even woman should have some gold, but not the passion. Passion is wrong. It is developed out of wrong thinking.</li>
<li>The fever is the trshnah, greed. Intense attachment to sense pleasures. Wealth and pleasure. All the commercials, <strong>advertisements are meant to attract people towards them. To create a sensation in the mind of a person, to occupy the mental space of the people and inject this passion, greed, attachment to pleasures into the mind.</strong> The defect by which the immunity is compromised is that <strong>the mind wants always more</strong>. Vulnerability of seeking more. Regarding any sense pleasure: food, money, watching TV etc.</li>
<li><strong>Close your eyes and notice whether the sense of more is coming again and again. Finally tell yourself you do not need more</strong>. In fact, you do not need anything. It is the body that needs some food.</li>
<li>To realize your true self you need to have a healthy mind in a healthy body. Body has cancer. Mind has trshna. You satisfy it and comes again back and wants more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvro5r-s78mum"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro5r-s78MuM">Class 2</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The fever of the mind - attachment to the sense pleasures. Intense desires. Medicine - jnana viraga bhesayam.</li>
<li><strong>Body is the instrument of action and therefore needs to be put to action. Medicine for it will be physical. Mind is the instrument of cognition. Any irregularity, illness in the mind will be cognitive in nature. Medicine will be cognitive - understanding of what is the self and what is non-self</strong>.</li>
<li>viraga follows naturally from viveka. The combination of these two is the medicine.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; is a fundamentally flawed attitude. You&rsquo;re not supposed to work for a reward. But for the love of the work.</strong> Reward is anatma and therefore unreal. Your dispassion is in question again.</li>
<li><strong>Practice viveka and vairagya just like you breath-in and breath-out. You&rsquo;re not thinking of any reward. This is the very spontaneity and this is also effortless.</strong></li>
<li>trsnah is the abnormal. It is the single source of illness. It will manifest in the body.</li>
<li><strong>Elimination of illness is the benefit. You remain what you are, normal. There is no positive benefit for any medicine.</strong></li>
<li>Identification with the desired object is the infection, the origin of the mental fever.</li>
<li>In Sanskrit &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; and &ldquo;taking a birth&rdquo; are considered the same.</li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s morning person is born out of the yesterday&rsquo;s desiring person.</li>
<li><strong>Give up the desire for sukhah and you will not know what is dukhah.</strong></li>
<li>You&rsquo;re the atma, you&rsquo;re aware of the movement of the mind. You&rsquo;ll address, lecture the mind. You&rsquo;re the guru to you. <strong>In identification you&rsquo;re the mind. In disidentification you&rsquo;re the atma.</strong> Buddha: be a light upon yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdnjv2kt8hpy---center-prisoner-of-space-and-time"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNJV2kt8HPY">Class 3</a> - center, prisoner of space and time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opposite of being aware of your own consciousness (which is not in motion) is not alert. You&rsquo;re identified with the mind. You&rsquo;re one with the flow, you do not have any space with reference to this flow. You&rsquo;re a samsari.</li>
<li>Be a witness to the mind. You&rsquo;re looking at the mind. Mind is the other. In doing so you&rsquo;ve discovered the mental space in reference to the mind. Now the mental states do not define you. You&rsquo;re aware of them. There is sukha, there is duhka. But you don&rsquo;t become sukhi, you don&rsquo;t become dukhi.</li>
<li>Most of the people are followers. Not thinkers.</li>
<li>The calamity the mind has created for us is aham and mama.</li>
<li>Look at yourself. There is a center in you. What is it? A bunch of memories. That is the &ldquo;me&rdquo;. It is the result of time. A center has always a space around it. And the space is bounded. As long as there is a center, there is circumference and the bounded space occupied by limited things. You created this prison.</li>
<li>Some people say I&rsquo;m free. I&rsquo;ve free will. There is no free will separate from the supreme will. It is like the prisoner saying I&rsquo;m free between the prison walls.</li>
<li>All the concepts outside of his space become extraordinarily important for the prisoner. In spite of acquiring all the concepts (religion, culture, family, etc.) he&rsquo;s still in prison. As long as there is the center there is no freedom. There center always creates space. No matter how big it will be it will be still limited. Prisoner of space and time.</li>
<li>Do your job. Do everything with tremendous vitality. But you don&rsquo;t need a center for it.</li>
<li>The moment you&rsquo;re asking for a method you&rsquo;re creating time.</li>
<li>Me is the jiva. It creates duality. There is a bigger me called God. Dvaitam is the product of me.</li>
<li>Look at the rising sun with the eyes of the gayatri manta. You&rsquo;ll not experience any division between yourself and the sun. Like looking at the beloved person. There is no me in you. Me vanishes. You the pure being, are just looking at another expression of your self. Without center-me you&rsquo;ll experience a vast space.</li>
<li>Me is the complex thing. The real simplicity is looking at things without me.</li>
<li>It is possible to live in the world without &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Sankhyas: posit the individual separate from the mind movement. There is a person called jiva and they called it atma. Atma is many. And then there is the mind moving and the mind is moving for the benefit of atma. First create me out of the movement of the mind and then say the movement of mind is meant for the benefit of this me.</strong> Mind is moving and creating sukha/dukha benefit for the jiva. All movement of the mind is meant for the multiple jivas called atma too.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfryppkhtoi---mind-as-machine"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfRYppkHtOI">Class 4</a> - mind as machine</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The only calamity in life is &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; syndrome.</strong> The first three purushartas are centered around me and mine and they strengthen the syndrome.</li>
<li>Sankhya example (wrong): chariot (mind) moves for the benefit of the master (atma). If mind moves the right way, atma gets joy, otherwise suffering. Atma is connected to pleasure and pain, atma becomes the bokta and mind is the karta.</li>
<li>Oh silly mind how can you create situations of enjoyment to me, the atma? You don&rsquo;t have sentience, you&rsquo;re jada. You cannot do nothing by itself. Also, atma doesn&rsquo;t need any enjoyment generated by the mind.</li>
<li><strong>Mind is a machine. Mere machine. It has a process, it functions and produces something. The thought process.</strong></li>
<li>Mind receives the sensations, converts the sensations into experience, then gives a label to the experience and records the experience. Next time the thought comes out of this memory.</li>
<li><strong>What is outside is always fresh and new.</strong> But the sensation goes into the mind, the mind compares and contrasts and makes it into a repetition. Even when you look at your spouse in the morning, you&rsquo;re looking at her freshly. But the mind makes it a repetition. It converts the present into past. Mind can only be repetitive. It can never have something original. Original comes from something more deep down.</li>
<li>What is before you is fresh, the sensation is fresh. But mind makes it repetitive. The thought can never be fresh. <strong>Thought is always a response of the memory. Therefore thought can never be creative.</strong></li>
<li>When you can never produce anything original (mind), better keep quiet (atma).</li>
<li>Controlled mind (hathayoga) is not a free mind.</li>
<li>When the mind becomes silent, it becomes knowledgable about its own movement. <strong>Quiet mind means freedom from thinking. Why are you sorrowful or excited? Because you&rsquo;re thinking.</strong> Why are you conflicted? Because the thought produces the conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom from thinking is moksha.</strong></li>
<li>If your mind is moving slowly, you don&rsquo;t have many thoughts.</li>
<li>In jumping from one thought to the other you&rsquo;ve become a victim of memory.</li>
<li>Mind is creating thoughts. Thought is from the memory, from the past.</li>
<li>When memory is put aside you&rsquo;re experiencing freshness. That brings out the creative being in you.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge - pious name given to the memory.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When you know your mind, the limits of your mind, you&rsquo;re beyond the mind.</strong></li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t come across human beings, but across human doings (doctor, teacher, engineer, ..).</li>
<li>Does your mediation spring from time or is timeless? Your meditation is also a doing. The real meditation is the essence of life. Is being aware of the mind. There is no phalam for it. It is a merger with the timelessness.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx49szimd4uo"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49szimd4Uo">Class 5</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Be a light unto yourself&rdquo; - Buddha&rsquo;s last advice to his disciples.</li>
<li><strong>Generally when people are alone they remain occupied. They indulge in a variety of thoughts.</strong> Instead try to watch your mind. Very soon, you&rsquo;ll be bored. That means you&rsquo;re not comfortable with looking at your mind. Therefore <strong>address the mind: &ldquo;mind, I&rsquo;m always contented. I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re or not.&quot;</strong></li>
<li><strong>As long as you&rsquo;re with the thoughts of the mind. You remain discontented. Fullness you never get by identifying with the mind.</strong></li>
<li>People are not contented at all. Moving from one to another. From one relationship to another. From one religion to another. For what? They&rsquo;re all dogmatic. They think, that through such movement of change they will find happiness. Meaning they are unhappy to start with.</li>
<li>Change for the sake of change or because you&rsquo;re bored/disenchanted with one thing, or because you&rsquo;re unhappy to start with, will never make you happy.</li>
<li>Contentment is true when you remain <strong>without any desire to change</strong>. If the change happens naturally I&rsquo;m not resisting.</li>
<li><strong>The trouble begins with comparing what you have with somebody else</strong> and therefore you want to change. You&rsquo;d live a life without comparison. First compare, next condemn and then become unhappy.</li>
<li><strong>I learn to live with my lot</strong>. I do not compare, I do not condemn. I desire no change. Any change that happens naturally is OK.</li>
<li><strong>When you&rsquo;re not comparing you&rsquo;re looking at the things as they are.</strong></li>
<li>Advise the mind to remain healthy by becoming quiet. Desires make the mind dull.</li>
<li>Religious-minded persons should be extra careful. Entire religion seems to have one purpose - get you what you seek.</li>
<li><strong>We&rsquo;re speaking of contentment, not speaking of indulgence, laziness.</strong> Contentment is timelessness. Desire for change is always time. We&rsquo;re not waiting for future.</li>
<li>Hope is no better than desire as far as creating psychological time is concerned.</li>
<li>When a thought or feeling arises, just watch it. Be aware of it. Out of it comes silence. That&rsquo;s meditation! You&rsquo;re not asking, not striving for silence. It naturally happens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-6httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyqfinphqina"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqfiNphqInA">Class 6</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This center, &ldquo;me&rdquo;, <strong>ego is as much a thought as any other silly thought.</strong> Any other thought might not have much significance. Pot-thoughts comes and goes. <strong>Whereas the me-thought stays there. Whole life it will be there unless you know yourself correctly,</strong> unless you realize that this &ldquo;me&rdquo; is false. And it will pick up a new body and continue to be there also. Therefore people identify with that &ldquo;me&rdquo;. This is the story of the ahamkara and the role of the ahamkara is the bondage of the samsara.</li>
<li>If you allow the ego to go, it will go. If you know it as false, it will vanish.</li>
<li><strong>When ahamkara is removed by not identifying with it, mind will not stop to function.</strong> The movement of the mind will be there but it will become impersonal. There are actions, cognition, intellection, thoughts but they are not mine.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; don&rsquo;t help you to live in a family, in a society, in a city and practicing a honest profession. They are only a big burden.</li>
<li>If you learn concepts you&rsquo;re not learning anything. That&rsquo;s why we discuss issues here.</li>
<li><strong>Look at your mind. And you&rsquo;ll be abiding as your true self. (Disidentification).</strong> You&rsquo;re never away from it. In every cognition (thought) the light of atma is shining brilliantly.</li>
<li><strong>A concept is never the truth.</strong> Push them aside and in their place create an issue. Cultivate a little impatience to know the truth and settle the issue of atma.</li>
<li>God creates chronological time, you create psychological time by pursuing your objects.</li>
<li><strong>The witness of the mind knows the mind. Do you know the mind or not? Don&rsquo;t try to rationalize too much, that makes a concept out of it. Just grab it and hold to it.</strong></li>
<li>Hunger is there but it is not mine. Therefore it is not bothering me.</li>
<li>Rise above the normal identification with hunger and thirst. Don&rsquo;t allow the hunger and thirst to dictate the life to you.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t drink/eat for enjoyment.</li>
<li>Not seeking the pleasure is not a stale state, it is the precondition for self-realization. <strong>Every pain is the price for the pleasure you&rsquo;ve sought and enjoyed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzkepb5wx6s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkEpB5Wx6s">Class 7</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Oh, mind, please get it. I&rsquo;m naturally beyond the six waves (birth and death of the body, thirst and hunger of prana, pleasure and pain of the mind). I&rsquo;m the essential element. Don&rsquo;t try to create confusion.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m the essential element not only of the body mind but also of this universe. I&rsquo;m the reality of the world experience.</li>
<li>Mind should be receptive and sensitive.</li>
<li>If you think in a gross way the world is outside and you&rsquo;re yourself. Look closely, is there a world without a cogniser? Can the world exist without your body? <strong>Did you ever experience the world without experiencing the body as a precondition?</strong> But you assume the world is the absolute and then speak of a creator&hellip; You&rsquo;re creating a wall between yourself and the truth.</li>
<li>And the body never exists without the mind. <strong>What you call body is simply an idea in the mind.</strong> You&rsquo;ve got it only when you think of the body. And the mind never exists without the consciousness.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve got 5 senses and therefore the world is made of 5 objects. There is no 6th object in the world.</li>
<li>There is no world without a world experience just as there is no movie without movie experience.</li>
<li>What you call world (jagat) has it&rsquo;s essence in the consciousness (atman). What you call world is what you&rsquo;re projecting out of yourself.</li>
<li>Jagat is shabda. The essence of shabda is shabda-jnana. Essense of shabda-jnana is the movement of mind. The movement of the mind is the background consciousness, which is the light of awareness, the absolute atman.</li>
<li><strong>We have to learn to see the world as an appearance in the consciousness.</strong> Think of the dream. Mountain in it is just your consciousness.</li>
<li>Consciousness doesn&rsquo;t manifest, it doesn&rsquo;t undergo any modification. <strong>Consciousness doesn&rsquo;t become the matter, matter appears in the consciousness. Consciousness appears as matter-consciousness.</strong></li>
<li>Sorrow and fear do not exist independent of the thought.</li>
<li><strong>Sruti talks of unity. Smrti has divisive thinking as its essence.</strong> All divisive thinking comes from it. In smrti all the things are real and different from everything else.</li>
<li>Window is not the source of light.</li>
<li>Smrtis do not sanction love marriage. They sanction marriage organised by the elders within the same cast and all kinds of other conditions. Love marriage is a revolt against all of that.</li>
<li>Smrti converts the sruti into a dead letter.</li>
<li><strong>You perceive a tree because you have the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; in your mind and that word is associated with a form. Mind is memory, bundle of past-experiences converted into knowledge. Suppose mind is made to become quiet and doesn&rsquo;t supply the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. You still perceive and you&rsquo;re the light.</strong>. Your knowledge of the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; prevents you from the seeing the right way, seeing the truth of the tree. E.g. if you see a friend or a foo that&rsquo;s the distortion made by the mind.</li>
<li><strong>Your consciousness is all-knowing. When you know English, you know it. When you don&rsquo;t know French, you know it too. Never underestimate its (your own) glory as the very ground of cognitions. The consciousness is always flowing through the prison of nama rupa put in place by the mind.</strong></li>
<li>Acknowledge you&rsquo;re the boss and not the mind. You command the mind &ldquo;keep quit, I&rsquo;m not interested in your movement in the form of supplying nama rupa in every cognition&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re coloring every cognition with nama rupa. When you try this this is shiva-drsthi. Shambavi mudra.</li>
<li>The mind always wants to categorize. If it can&rsquo;t, it will be very uneasy. <strong>Let not the mind categorize and there still will be perception. Without categorization the perception cannot disturb you. And somehow strangely you&rsquo;ll see that the perception is no other than you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It is the joy that makes your heart innocent. Pursuit of pleasure makes you clever, cunning, egoistic.</strong></li>
<li>Shankara: mind, your movement, it&rsquo;s just a waste. Just keep quiet. Your heart opens to that immeasurable. That&rsquo;s meditation.</li>

<li>People are deluded into thinking that the movement of the mind is their essence.</li>
<li>Prarabda&rsquo;s reach is creating favorable/unfavorable situations in your life. Then ajnana in the form of self-identification with the mind takes over.</li>
<li>If you identify with the mind then the changes deeply impact you and you become alternatively sukhi and dukhi. If that identification is snapped, it (changes caused by prarabda) will have no impact you.</li>
<li>Oh silly mind, <strong>if only you keep quiet (tvajI prashAnte), divisive thinking vanishes (bedhadhIh nAsti)</strong>.</li>
<li>Personal. My lungs, my nostrils, my air that I inhale. The personality is entirely product of the mind. And we associate that life-giving process (prana) with me and mine. Tendency is towards division. You&rsquo;re inhaling the same air that the entire humanity is inhaling. You&rsquo;re connected with entire flora and fauna through this process.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to the inhalation and exhalation and understand that they are not connected to the finite (body, mind) but to the life giving air, the universal</strong>, the infinite.</li>
<li>All division is in the mind (chitta), none in the reality (chit). This recognition is called joga.</li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;m a living entity and the whole world is non-living. I&rsquo;m a sentient being wheres the world is insentient. It is dead nature, dead world, dead universe.</strong></li>
<li>All entities, we&rsquo;re all so many bubbles in the ocean of cosmic light. All the objects, all the events are not excluded.</li>
<li>Wherever there is a sense of division, there is insecurity and fear. And therefore so much agitation in the mind. The moment divisive thinking is gone you&rsquo;ll be free from all that. No more suffering.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t teach divisive identification into the minds of impressionable people.</li>

<li>We stand in identification with the mind and then address the world. Oh world, make me happy. Step back and look at the mind and see.</li>
<li>The witness of the mind is that which knows the mind. If the mind vanishes it is just the mind only.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of trying to control the mind. It is not necessary. Leave it alone and don&rsquo;t waste the inner energy.</strong> You&rsquo;ll not be creating any conflict.</li>
<li>The understanding is powerful enough that without any effort the mind gets purged of impurities.</li>
<li>You look at a person&rsquo;s accomplishments and you feel happy about it. That should be the way your mind should move, you feel. No jealousy.</li>
<li><strong>The situation is a fact. Not truth, but a fact. Unpleasantness is a projection.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be the love of a husband. Don&rsquo;t call yourself a husband. The word husband comes with a huge conditioning.</strong> Don&rsquo;t be the householder, be the love of a householder.</li>
<li><strong>I don&rsquo;t know. Others don&rsquo;t know. That is double ajnana. It is not necessary for the others to know the truth. It is enough so you know. Like in a dream, when you&rsquo;re suffering, all problems are resolved. All others (and their problems) are in your dream.</strong> No need to assume that because the others are not knowing the truth you need a special way to deal with them. While dealing with others develop a sense of equanimity and harmony. If others are insensitive, which they are more often than not, all you need is titiksha. Endure.</li>
<li>Consciousness is the content of consciousness. All if the content put together becomes the world. There is no other world. The mind &ldquo;inside&rdquo; is the counterpart of the &ldquo;matter&rdquo; outside and vice-versa.</li>
<li><strong>Mind is &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and the world is &ldquo;outside&rdquo;. Subject and object division. This is the moha. This moha is the product of the movement of the mind.</strong></li>
<li>When the delusion is gone is understand myself as that spontaneous, effortless state of perfect silence. Nameless and formless reality. You might call it God or Brahman. In that there is no division.</li>
<li>Division is of two kinds. Benign like seeing different objects of the world. It is required for the transactional thinking. And divisive thinking in which you divide human beings in terms of caste, creed, religion. That is destructive.</li>
<li>Sakshatkara, direct perception, one&rsquo;s reality doesn&rsquo;t need senses. Perception requires senses. Direct knowing (avagati) doesn&rsquo;t require mind. <strong>Therefore: oh mind, I&rsquo;m not concerned with your movement, I&rsquo;ve understood my true nature.</strong> I&rsquo;m not bound.</li>
<li>Stepping back and watching the mind requires sattvaguna. In tamoguna you identify with the body, lose all sensitivity and become very dull. Tamas and rajas go together and are the very nature of the mind. You&rsquo;ve to uplift the mind to sattva.</li>
<li>When you identify when the restlessness gets new energy. You&rsquo;re restless you cannot disidentify. The two elements are just one. Learn the art of contentment and the mind loses its restlessness.</li>
<li>Mind is moha. In this creation there is no friend, no foe. There is only divinity. Nobody can hurt you. Only you yourself can hurt yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Moksha is when your consciousness is full of harmony.</strong> You&rsquo;re not frustrated/unhappy/hating anybody. You endure some of the undesirable situations and you respond with love to hostility. That is the freedom from bondage, from being locked-up in your mind.</li>
<li>Know yourself as simple and single. That is the freedom from bondage. I&rsquo;m not old, I&rsquo;m not young. I&rsquo;m neither beautiful, nor ugly&hellip; That is the simplicity. Single - you love entire humanity but you&rsquo;re alone (not lonely).</li>
<li><strong>Really speaking it is the mind that get&rsquo;s caught and get&rsquo;s liberated.</strong> Atma is never bound.</li>
<li>Vikara - as you cognize the situation you&rsquo;re impacted by it. Certain things are painful or pleasant. The moment you declare something painful/pleasant you&rsquo;re impacted. The pleasant and the painful do not exist. In that understanding you lose the vikara and emerge as avikriya.</li>
<li><strong>In giving a situation the name &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve already created the &ldquo;painful&rdquo; situation.</strong> You&rsquo;ll be always caught in the conflict of opposites. Just see facts, don&rsquo;t give names. Maintain equanimity. <strong>Do not name any situation as pleasant or unpleasant.</strong> When you look at a flower don&rsquo;t call it beautiful, because it will be only a matter of time until you see an ugly. <strong>Become bland, rise above the opposites as pleasant and painful. That &ldquo;blandness&rdquo; is called bliss.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Critical element: participation in the teaching. You allow it to be part of your being. Don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;watch&rdquo; like a tennis match.</strong></li>
<li>Sukha and dukha happen only when you anticipate them.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have a proper understanding of the whole life. <strong>You divide the life into bits and pieces and decide sukha/dukha for each bit.</strong> Unless an ignorant mind projects sukha and dukha there cannot be sukha/dukha. Rise above the projection. Things just happen. Sukha and dukha happen around you, in the body, mind. But they never happen to me.</li>
<li>Worldly people just drift. Victims of ever changing society, body, and mind. Carried with total identification with the situation around the body and mind. <strong>Worldy people own up the movement.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I feel very clearly, without an iota of doubt, a distance with reference to the content. I&rsquo;m the knowing element. Nothing can ever happen without me knowing.</strong></li>
<li>Deep-sleep, waking does not happen to myself. Somehow there is a distance between me and these states.</li>
<li><strong>Develop titiksha. Begin with sukha. When it comes, be sober, quiet. Accept the sukha gracefully and try to handover it to others.</strong> Then when dukha comes, you&rsquo;ll be able to handle it.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;d live in a family like lotus-leaf in murky waters.</li>
<li>Only love should guide you. First love (in spite of idiosyncrasies and misbehaviour of the others) and then you do what you will.</li>
<li>It is not necessary that others understand me. The other need not approve me. It is up to them. The others will correct themselves when they want to correct themselves.</li>
<li>Meditation begins when thought comes to an end. When you&rsquo;re aware of what happens in your mind it becomes quiet. When the thought stops creating (sukha, dukha situations).</li>
<li><strong>Mind is like a child. When it falls it cries a bit. It waits for your response. If you pay attention it will cry like crazy.</strong> If not, it will get up, clear the clothes of dust and continue what it did before.</li>
<li>All illness originates in the mind.</li>
<li>What you have to do is not go to the society and start reforming it. Address the mind to keep quiet. Silly mind, why are you doing all this nonsense?</li>
<li>You seem to be the result of your parent&rsquo;s beliefs, habits and fears. You as the person are the result of the past. Of time. Time is the past going through the present to become the future.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not a traditionalist. I don&rsquo;t belong to any parampara.</li>

<li>When you don&rsquo;t see the distinction between an idea and the truth you&rsquo;ll be deprived of the later.</li>
<li>Negative understanding is the highest understanding. In understanding how you&rsquo;re in the bondage of time the door will open for yourself to step into timelessness.</li>
<li><strong>Every idea has its origin in the past. All of the past is the raw material out of which you the person is created and sustained.</strong></li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I was&rdquo;. &ldquo;I will be&rdquo;. Only &ldquo;I am&rdquo; has a touch of reality which the other two don&rsquo;t have. And that reality is you.</strong></li>
<li>Memory is time. What you see is what is dictated by memory. No surprise life is very dull for us. It is the recycling of the same memory again. It doesn&rsquo;t inspire us.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m opposed to time, not to astrology. Because I want to realize myself as timeless.</li>
<li><strong>When you are performing all kinds of actions with a result in mind, hoping for a better future, you&rsquo;re sacrificing the present, the timelessless at the alter of imagined future.</strong></li>
<li>Religions are the past. An organised religion is the frozen thought of the head who lived a long time ago. Truth doesn&rsquo;t have a tradition. Only propaganda has a tradition.</li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;m alert to every concept that is likely to catch me in the net of time.</strong></li>
<li>Drop the past when you encounter a person or a thing. It will appear in a new light, without attachment or enmity. Look at the tree without nama rupa. You as subject won&rsquo;t be there. There will be only observation without an observer. You experience the vastness, newness, freshness, being, awareness, life. There will be no name.</li>
<li>Food that you eat you should not make you feel heavy.</li>
<li>Life should be disciplined and orderly, and healthy body kept by exercise.</li>
<li>Aditiya Upasana of Rama: <em>Oh Lord, I&rsquo;m about to embark upon the performance of my duty. The battle against this asura (Ravana), that is in me only.

<li>It is estimated that 90% of the suffering is mental and the rest physical and not evitable. Mental suffering is needless. <strong>All suffering arises from the psychological time.</strong> The mind wants to accomplish so many things in the world, which requires effort, which is time. Body is unable to cope with this demands so suffering is created. The past, which is memory, which is mind, which is time, becomes the suffering.</li>
<li>Death is always in the future. When the present is alive and aware there is no death.</li>
<li>When you understand that death and birth come together you&rsquo;ll not celebrate birthday. You have put death to future and are enthusiastic about the birthday. Death is not in future, death is now. Die to the time, body identification, past, mind, me&hellip; Do that and you&rsquo;re free! <strong>There is freedom in death.</strong></li>
<li><strong>By putting the death to the future you&rsquo;ve created the fear of death.</strong> It is a fully. Don&rsquo;t put death to future, put it now.</li>
<li><strong>Death is always with reference to something</strong>.</li>
<li>Practical vedanta vs. armchair philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>Aliveness, newness of the present moment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;ve taken upon you the life of modifications and they become you and so you&rsquo;re now a victim of time</strong>. Atma is avikara. <strong>All our suffering is because of modifications.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In doing all the changes happen. In being there is no change, no vikara. You&rsquo;re fundamental essence is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&rdquo;. There is no doing it it, it is only being.</strong> And in being there is no time. Just be. Do, think, move means time.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re timeless and everything else a process. So don&rsquo;t make this cardinal sin of identifying with the process and therefore put yourself in the time.</li>
<li><strong>The god that I worship is entirely created out of my own estimate of myself. Man creates god in his image and then that god creates the man in his image.</strong></li>
<li>Human mind doesn&rsquo;t want to admit that it doesn&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;Destiny&rdquo; is the name for &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. If you say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; it is innocence.</li>
<li><strong>You do not see the mind with mind. You see the mind with your own light. It is the atma that sees the mind in dream. You can repeat that experience in waking state by watching the mind.</strong> You&rsquo;re the light. Therefore you&rsquo;re one without the second.</li>
<li>You alone are real (sat), all the mind has collected sums up to zero (asat).</li>

<li>When you understand it is not accumulation. Binary method (samvada) is for understanding.</li>
<li>Mithya - it appears, you see it and yet it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
<li><strong>In reality it is not you who sees all the dream objects. It is the dream subject that is created along all the dream objects.</strong> And that dream subject sees all the dream objects. <strong>If you focus on dream objects it is realism. If you focus on dream subject it is idealism. Truth is neither, both subject and object are created together</strong>. Truth is the consciousness that transcends the subject-object division.</li>
<li>All created by the movement by the mind is unreal -&gt; mind&rsquo;s movement is unreal. Mind is the movement and the movement is the mind.</li>
<li>In the entire story only that you&rsquo;ve sen a dram is real.</li>
<li>This mind is there when you don&rsquo;t want to find it. <strong>Mind makes you suffer so much. You reverse and try to find it. And you&rsquo;ll only see that it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</strong> Mithya.</li>
<li>Ramana: what you consider the world is merely your conception of the world. Both are equally unreal.</li>
<li>Anirvachaniya - that which cannot be categorised as existent or non-existent. Something appearing. The movement of the mind.</li>

<li>In sleep, the person (aham), the world and the god is not there. Vedanta is about the inner most reality, not about god etc.</li>
<li><strong>The known (world) depends on the knower (aham). And when you look at the vastness of the world, you&rsquo;re obliged to bring about the god.</strong> If creator is in the beginning than the creator is yourself.</li>
<li><strong>You know what you know and you know what you don&rsquo;t know (Chinese). Therefore you&rsquo;re sarvajnah, just like the creator in the beginning.</strong> This is Vedanta.</li>
<li>People prefer conceptual Vedanta, where brahman is the creator. And sampradaya, systems become more important. <strong>When there is a vision, a system has no value.</strong> It can be in its place, we don&rsquo;t pay much attention on that. In Vedanta the focus is on you. The teaching helps you to discover your vastness, to which we give the name brahman.</li>
<li>Bhashyakara very appropriately named the Brahma Sutra as sharIrakam shastram. The one that is obtained in this body mind.</li>
<li>The way to remove misconceptions is to inquire, study, investigate.</li>
<li><strong>The truth, the real cannot be measured. Cannot be captured. Drsh (view, sight - držať).</strong></li>
<li>In idealism they give priority to the drashta. In realism they give reality to the drshya. I don&rsquo;t fit in any category because both are interdependent only. They are appearances and the <strong>reality is one, present in darshanam, drstha, drashyam (immanent), but really speaking it is beyond all three (transcendent).</strong></li>
<li>Duality as an experience is not contested. It&rsquo;s a fact, not truth.</li>
<li>If guru and parampara is what sustains you then there is no advantage in joining Vedanta.</li>
<li>The dream experience is with you all the time. But you never looked at it  closely. <strong>The knower rises with the known and the known rises with the knower.</strong> Waking up is simply negating the dream.</li>
<li>Seer is unreal -&gt; Shunyavada. Seer&rsquo;s essential nature is Brahma -&gt; Vedanta. Seer is uncertain.</li>
<li><strong>Seeing is the truth. What you see is unreal. That you see is real.</strong> You can get this conclusion from the dream experience also. <strong>All that you&rsquo;ve seen incl. the subject is unreal, but that you&rsquo;ve seen a dream is real. Out of that seeing springs up a seer supposedly within and seen supposedly without. What you call &ldquo;seer&rdquo;, the me, the person is but a thought. What you call &ldquo;seen&rdquo; is also an idea in the mind.</strong></li>
<li>There is a world experienced by you only when you&rsquo;re a body/mind identified person. Suppose you&rsquo;re not a body/mind identified person, like in deep sleep, then there is no world.</li>
<li><strong>When the mind is perfectly still, there is no waking state anymore.</strong> The drastha, drshyam, darshanam triad has come to and end.</li>
<li><strong>The knowingness alone is real. In that knowingness the triad alone appears and disappears. The knower and known are added by the mind. Knowing alone with being is your true nature.</strong></li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re angry with a person. The adversary is the known / unreal. The angry person, the ego, is also unreal. The atma caitanya which illuminates this interaction is the real.</li>
<li>It is your delusion, because you&rsquo;re imagining things. Mind is imperfect. All you need to do is to purify the mind so it stops identifying with the persona created by the mind&rsquo;s movement and relegates its oneness with the light of awareness / atma. That mind is the maya.</li>
<li>Maya doesn&rsquo;t have antecedents. Maya is not false because of something else, it just is false. Everything else is false due to maya.</li>
<li><strong>Is maya satya or mithya? I do not want to answer this question. What appears due to maya is mithya. What remains after negation is satya.</strong></li>

<li>Motion is critical. <strong>Without motion you won&rsquo;t see multiplicity.</strong> Something is moving, creating a sense of division. The movement which is the mind creates the experience of subject object duality.</li>
<li>Utilitarian (what&rsquo;s in for me) approach comes from wordliness. In Vedanta we do not look at the utility of understanding the truth. It has its own value. I&rsquo;m not interested in benefits accruing to me from knowing the truth. I just speak the truth.</li>
<li><strong>What you call &ldquo;tree&rdquo; is nothing but tree-consciousness.</strong> There is no thief but a thief-consciousness. All is myself. All that exists is myself. All appearances are in me only.</li>
<li>Avasthu yoga: the division has no intrinsic reality.</li>
<li><strong>Shakti is one power. The power to emerge as rupa jnanam and shabda jnanam are the same.</strong> Within you, the knower, there is no division in rupa, rasa, ghanda etc. That kind of outcome division doesn&rsquo;t create a division in the origin (shakti). Extrapolate to multiple knowers.</li>

<li>Once you negate the world the limitations of conciousness also get negated.</li>
<li>Jagat is known to the knower through a means of knowing. The means of knowing is mithya and the status of the knower (knowership) is also mihtya. The division is mithya, only the light of awareness in which this subject-object division shines is real.</li>
<li><strong>When you assume yourself to be the drastha (knower) you assume yourself to be standing away from that brahman.</strong> Once the drahstrtavm is negated, you do not stand apart anymore and merge into the light of awareness that alone is.</li>
<li>If jivas are many, what about Ishvara? Sankya: you don&rsquo;t need Ishvara. Believer needs Isvhara, he&rsquo;s the inner need. It&rsquo;s like a child, it holds on to mother. Advaita: the one atma is Ishvara.</li>
<li>If atmas are many -&gt; atmas are limited -&gt; atmas undergo transformations -&gt; atmas go extinct -&gt; shunyavada.</li>
<li><strong>Existence of the world: you need a conscious being to have the appearance of the jagat.</strong></li>
<li>Whenever you take yourself as the inner light, you&rsquo;ll never experience the multiplicity, division. It&rsquo;s not about experiencing some kind of exotic oneness.</li>
<li><strong>Why the mind is doing the mistake identifying with separate existence? Because it is imperfect. Because it is crude (tamoguna) and restless (rajoguna), thus lacks viveka and identifies with the body.</strong> Therefore, purify the mind, make it calm and sensitive.</li>
<li>The world that the ajnani sees is not the same as the world that the jnani sees. The way people concretise - identify with the nama rupa, is the problem. <strong>Learn to take the nama rupa lightly, dismiss them. As long as you hold on to nama rupa you remain a body identified person and are far from the truth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Where there is no projection of fear or desire, there is no ego also.</strong></li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not going to experience the infinite. The approach is rather negative. You&rsquo;d look at the particularization of yourself and give it up. Dismiss all kind of projections or mental forms which divide you, make you feel small and limited. Overcome fragmentary thinking - dvaita buddhi.</li>
<li>If you stop the categorization you&rsquo;ll instinctively feel the oneness.</li>

<li>North and south pole are opposites, but they are not opposed. They are together in the same magnetic field. The differences do not separate. There are opposites but there is not opposition.</li>
<li>The divide and to particularize is the nature of the mind. <strong>If you give free run the mind it will divide, divide and divide.</strong> Separation is against the truth. Nature is one. Reality is one.</li>
<li>Anything which is limited in space is invariably limited in time also. Dualist conveniently avoid any mention of space and time. Why? Because they give a form to god. Doing so you&rsquo;re doing an injustice to the whole vision. You&rsquo;re putting beginning and end to the god. Therefore atma cannot be many.</li>
<li><strong>The ego is precipitated or is posited in the consciousness whenever there is a desire. The desire or fear or all-is-not-well sense belong to it.</strong></li>
<li>Person is the same as ago. They are not two different things.</li>
<li>Upasana requires duality. But only take that much duality that is needed for it. Don&rsquo;t take it too far. Duality is admitted only provisionally.</li>
<li>Emotionalism and sentimentality are not true devotions. They are traps.</li>
<li><strong>The expressions of jnana are infinite.</strong></li>

<li><strong>I&rsquo;m prior to the mind (-&gt; time). I&rsquo;m prior to the perception, inference, scriptural instruction. I&rsquo;m prior to the body (-&gt; space). I&rsquo;m prior to the world.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Before you rise a doubt whether atma is real or not, I&rsquo;m already there. You cannot say I&rsquo;m unreal. I (atma) can declare you&rsquo;re unreal (mind). Projections alone can be unreal. Divisions are projects. It cannot be but your imaginations, your projection.</strong></li>
<li>I can never ever be false. Generally what you negate is many and unreal. What remains is one and cannot be negated.</li>

<li>the very existence is associated with diversity</li>
<li>Nowadays Buddhism has become like puranic Hinduism. Full of forms.</li>
<li>The dialogue between the sunyavadi and atmavadi is the very proof for existence. You cannot have any such deliberation about sunya. If atma were like the horn of a rabbit there would be no such deliberation about it.</li>
<li>Whatever mind projects is unreal. Now the mind will say even the atma is unreal. Now atma is saying to the mind &ldquo;oh mind, you cannot say that&rdquo;. Even before you rise to say anything, I&rsquo;m there. Just like a son cannot you the father doesn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
<li>You can never ever be unaware of yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Doubt comes only when the mind is active.</strong> But you&rsquo;re there no matter what. When you find yourself in doubt, just pass.</li>
<li><strong>It is the thought that breeds sorrow, conflict, fear. Hold your ground, tell yourself: You&rsquo;re prior to the thought.</strong></li>

<li>Knowing is the mechanical process that is performed by the mind. The mind which is but a thought. It is the thought which knows and a thought is a mechanical movement and out of this movement knowledge happens.</li>
<li><strong>When you&rsquo;re thoughtless, you&rsquo;re aware you&rsquo;re the pure knowingness in which there is no knowingness of any particular thing.</strong></li>
<li>The magnet doesn&rsquo;t make the iron fillings move. When the magnet is present, they move. The world shines in the presence of the sun. The sun doesn&rsquo;t make the world shine. Sun is and shines.</li>
<li>Act of knowing belongs to the domain of the mind, not atma. Atma doesn&rsquo;t guide the mind (e.g. say &ldquo;have good thoughts&rdquo;). Mind is guided by its own latencies.</li>
<li><strong>Whatever is known by the mind has two qualities. It is divisive, therefore dualistic and it is unreal.</strong> Therefore atma is unknown and unknowable by the mind. This very fact proves atma is real (because whatever is known to the mind is unreal).</li>
<li><strong>Writing the exam and passing the exam is one integrated action. The mistake happens that we take the action which is in the present and split it. Make one part of the action in the present and one in the future (result). That is kamya karma. If you pray before the exam to write the exam well that is not kamya karma (but duty-based action). If I pray to give a good class and get dakshina that is kamya karma (desire-based action).</strong></li>

<li>The glow is the sat and the glow that you see is asat. What you see is unreal.</li>
<li><strong>We have to admit the real. You cannot say shunyam is the element from which it all comes.</strong> Because it is shunyam, it is void. Nothing comes out of nothing.</li>
<li><strong>The glow cannot be shunya because we&rsquo;re deliberating on it.</strong> Same logic apply to multiplicity also.</li>
<li><strong>If the duality is taken as real then the original real will become unreal. The real cannot be two, it can be only one.</strong></li>
<li>Whatever the mind projects is unreal. But the unreal looks real. Just appearance alone should not push you into any wrong conclusions. Check, whether it is time-bound or not. Whether it is transient or not. <strong>When it is real it cannot be transient.</strong></li>
<li>Upanishads are not theological, not dogmatic, not stories. Upanishads are entirely doctrinal.</li>
<li>Yat nityam tad eva satyam. Cardinal principle of Shankara. Whatever is timeless is real.</li>
<li><strong>When you believe in it, the appearance is taken as real.</strong> If you doubt it (raise questions about it) the &ldquo;reality&rdquo; vanishes.</li>
<li>Transiency is best proof of unreality. Whatever is limited in time is limited in space.</li>
<li>When it is unreal, then there is no need to deliberate upon it.</li>
<li>In spite of the appearance of the unreal, the real is not affected.</li>
<li><strong>What you call outside is very much inside the mind only.</strong> It is the movement of the mind itself that creates this schism that you call outside/inside. Jagat is apparently outside the body but is inside the mind. What you call jagat is movement of mind only.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be carried away by usefulness and TX. It doesn&rsquo;t imply reality.</li>
<li><strong>You have a commitment to make the world real. If not entirely, at least partially you&rsquo;ve invested your emotions in the world and you want it to be real. If not as real as brahman, at least 50:50. That&rsquo;s why you miss the point.</strong></li>
<li>The world is a projection of the mind entirely built on memory and imaginations.</li>
<li>It is the nature of the mind to imagine goals and strive for those. And therefore there are goals which are very &ldquo;real&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Goal, desire, fulfilling the desire, reaching the goal, striving for the goal. These are all states of the mind. The real is beyond the mind.</li>

<li>It is always the human mind that wants to know the purpose. If you minus the human mind you can remove the word &lsquo;purpose&rsquo; from the dictionary.</li>
<li><strong>Truth doesn&rsquo;t serve any purpose whereas untruth does serve multiple purposes.</strong></li>
<li>Student should always seek the truth without ever without ever asking about it&rsquo;s purpose.</li>
<li>The purpose belongs to the realm of unreal. Don&rsquo;t you ever bring this argument (of purpose) to truth. Purpose -&gt; holding to unreal.</li>
<li>Your dualistic sat (god) is good as asat. It serves a purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Not serving a purpose doesn&rsquo;t establish unreality.</strong> You imagine purpose with your mind, your own thinking, based on your own latencies.</li>
<li>What do you want to gain by learning Vedanta? It helps you examine the reality of your experiences.</li>
<li>Realization of the self doesn&rsquo;t serve any purpose what-so-ever. There are no rewards.</li>
<li>People are more credulous than thinking. Nobody has the inner space to examine the vision very closely.</li>

<li>Maya - movement in the motionless Brahman.</li>
<li>The movement is characterized by space and time.</li>
<li>Maya - space time continuum. Continuum is when there are two things you cannot separate. And the space time continuum directly gives rise to variety, multiplicity.</li>
<li>Truth is always one. Real is always one. The multiplicity that you experience is a product of maya.</li>
<li><strong>Without consciousness there is no error. Wall, pot etc. don&rsquo;t make the error.</strong> The appearance of the serpent is possible only because there is the background of consciousness upholding that appearance.</li>

<li>Where did this world experience begin? This morning. Where? In my consciousness. Prior of that what were you? The pure light of awareness. Prior the onset of the multiplicity there was the real. And you&rsquo;re the real.</li>
<li><strong>All knowledge is nescience.</strong></li>
<li>What you get out of struggle is nescience. What you get spontaneously is the truth. self-realization is not a knowledge. You&rsquo;re what you&rsquo;re for no particular reason.</li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;re what you are not because of what you know you&rsquo;re. There is no knowing involved in it.</strong></li>

<li>Vedanta is study of the real. Science is study of the forms. Vedanta begins where science ends.</li>
<li><strong>Child has no mind and it gradually acquires it. Mind is a collection of ideas acquired from the family, society &hellip; and then putting the things together the mind comes with its own projection.</strong></li>
<li>Whatever idea about the real can only be a projection. Knowing the self is not possible. If the self is known it becomes the other.</li>
<li>Svasamvedhyatvam - knowing oneself by oneself. There is no such thing.</li>
<li>How? There is no how. Atma is. The real is which is.</li>
<li><strong>There is no need to know the being. It is not possible either. Because the being itself is the knowing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you want to know yourself, sir? Then just be yourself! It is enough to stop imagining oneself to be this or that.</strong></li>
<li>By knowing what you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re free that. I&rsquo;m not the riches. I&rsquo;m poor neither.</li>
<li>The truth is always bitter.</li>
<li>The richman is one who is slave to his riches.</li>
<li>Clever swami wanting to rest: &ldquo;I will answer all questions that are not based on ID with body mind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>By identification with what you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not in your natural state.In this natural state this expectation to know what I&rsquo;m will vanish. You&rsquo;ll leave the abnormal, excited, feverish state of a worldly person.</li>
<li>Atma is avishesha (vishesha - quality, label, specialty, property). Atma is not something. Don&rsquo;t say nothing. You&rsquo;ve a fixed idea that you&rsquo;ve to be something&hellip; No label apply to you.</li>
<li>Sanjasi feels proud that he belongs to the dashanami (bharati, saraswati &hellip;). That&rsquo;s what binds you. No, you&rsquo;re avisesha.</li>
<li>Love the family members. You don&rsquo;t need to label yourself as a family person.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;You are&rdquo; is same as &ldquo;you know&rdquo;. They are not two different things. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;I know&rdquo;.</strong> It&rsquo;s enough to know what you&rsquo;re not.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge is always a description. Description of what? Of what is already known. Perceptually, conceptually or inferentially.</strong></li>
<li>What you&rsquo;re cannot be described except as total negation. Neti neti.</li>
<li>As you can point as this or that it cannot be yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Can you be something else? How can you be something else? You can only be yourself. If you can&rsquo;t be something else, how can you say I&rsquo;m this or I&rsquo;m that?</strong></li>
<li>Remember, without you there cannot be no perception, no conception. Whatever is perceived or conceived, you&rsquo;re not.</li>
<li>The proof of the pudding is in it&rsquo;s eating. Taste the freedom that comes of the scissor neti-neti. Live it.</li>
<li>What helps you to know yourself correctly that is sadhana.</li>
<li>To know oneself correctly, to realize oneself correctly rather, is bliss, freedom, ananda, love, emancipation. Not knowing oneself correctly and taking up superimpositions is sorrow, bondage.</li>
<li><strong>The family has to look on you as a family person. You don&rsquo;t need to look at yourself as a family person. Don&rsquo;t imagine anything about yourself.</strong></li>

<li>Not accepting atma (yourself) as being distinct from body mind, no amount of study will have no effect. You have to reach beyond verbal expression.</li>
<li>Body and mind are shields (koshas). They shield the atma. They cover.</li>
<li>Body is the doing element. Mind is the thinking element (subtle doing). Go deeper. To the knowing element.</li>
<li>Atma is the light of awareness, the ground, base in which the mind is thinking and organ of speech communicating this thoughts.</li>
<li>Shunyavadis subscribe to four elements. Akasha is void, it doesn&rsquo;t exit.</li>
<li><strong>Birth - was it an experience registered by the mind? Therefore I cannot tell about myself that I was born.</strong> You&rsquo;d question it. You&rsquo;re inferring that you&rsquo;re born. People are telling that you&rsquo;re born. Shastra is telling you&rsquo;re not born. What do you take? Don&rsquo;t follow anything. Take the clue from everything.</li>
<li>Follower sounds like you&rsquo;re not very great. Belief doesn&rsquo;t sound very good. Tradition is a better name. Parampara. You remain a follower and call yourself traditionalist.</li>
<li>Birth is an idea. Same for death. <strong>You don&rsquo;t have the experience of death, just experience some people dying.</strong></li>
<li>The power that created the body takes care of the body.</li>
<li>Ultimate good is not there in indestructible body, extended life, this and that.</li>
<li><strong>What is whole is also holistic, holy. It is the opposite of fragmented.</strong> Go above.</li>
<li>Love your enemy. It means there is no enemy. How to do it? By love.</li>
<li><strong>The illness of the body originates in the mind. See the ignorance of the fragmentation and get over it.</strong></li>
<li>When there is no fragmentation in you as &ldquo;myself&rdquo; and &ldquo;not myself&rdquo; then the sadhana chatusthaya will come to you very smoothly.</li>
<li>Spirit of crucifixion is the negation of the body. That&rsquo;s what Buddha and Krishna teach about.</li>

<li>There is no connection between Radha Krishna and Gita Krishna whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>When your mind is active, you&rsquo;re not understanding. You&rsquo;re collecting.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Understanding is not additive, it doesn&rsquo;t accumulate. In learning, there is no accumulation, no addition.</strong></li>
<li>Suffering caused by misconception about oneself cannot be eliminated by accumulating knowledge. For that you need to understand your misconception.</li>
<li>In Vedanta there is only one devata. Atma. People want the word devaha, the divine, somewhere away and separate from them.</li>
<li>You who was born is imagined (kalpita). You who was not born is akalpita.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re anxious to learn, you&rsquo;re never anxious to learn.</li>
<li>Street dogs can be very dangerous, mango is very tasty &hellip; is that accumulation? No. <strong>You learn by inquiry</strong>. Inquiry is a job to be done by you, in you, for you. Submitting to something called vedanta is not inquiry.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re always free from death, birth, &hellip;. by your very nature.</li>
<li><strong>Anybody who claims to be a jnani and others are ajnanis is ajnani himself.</strong> Mahatma says none of us were born and will die. Our nature is like that.</li>

<li><strong>The imagined comes only after the thought (movement) begins.</strong> After the thought begins it is real.</li>
<li><strong>Look at yourself. You&rsquo;re not an imagination.</strong></li>
<li>Ideas like birth and death only appear when the thought begins. Before thought there is no time itself.</li>
<li>Without movement there is no time. Therefore thought is encased in time.</li>
<li>Thought is fragmentary, thought divides. Prior to thought there is no division.</li>
<li>Thinkers vs. yes-sayers.</li>
<li><strong>Maya: you&rsquo;re aware of body/mind but unsure of atma. Which is the only thing you&rsquo;d be sure of.</strong></li>
<li>You cannot question that which is prior to the thought. It is as real, as tough as a diamond.</li>
<li>Look into your thought process which is the thought process. Consciousness is defined here as the content of consciousness.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t understand the power of your desire. It will mold your life and the one thereafter.</li>
<li>You want to uplift the world. Learn instead. Don&rsquo;t teach. Keep quiet. You cause trouble for this and next life for the person you teach. If you have to teach, teach there is no birth, death, old age for you. You&rsquo;re brahman, you&rsquo;re atma.</li>
<li>If you believe you can do it. If you believe you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s all in your mind. If you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a very unlucky person&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll become very unlucky.</li>

<li>Duality does not really exist.</li>
<li>Before you can settle birth or not birth, atma must be there. To make the mistake about ropesnake, there must be some light. And to fix the mistake, you also need light. The knowing element must always be there. Either to say there is birth or to say there is no birth.</li>
<li>Shankara is struggling a lot to dismiss the birth.</li>
<li>Mother remains the mother and the child is born. What kind of &ldquo;born&rdquo; it is?</li>
<li>Dvaita is only appearing, it is not taking birth at all.</li>
<li>Unless you resolve this contradiction (birth impossible for atma) you&rsquo;ll pay a very bitter price. Develop that space in reference to body and mind. You&rsquo;re never born, you&rsquo;ll never die. Discover your immortality here and now.</li>

<li>Realization - purging the consciousness of false notion.</li>
<li>Idea is never the truth.</li>
<li>Instead of saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;re following of a frozen thought&rdquo; we prefer tho nice name &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;. There is no updating, no thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate all the structures and systems that you&rsquo;ve put in place to reinforce the notion of birth</strong>. Therefore in your consciousness the idea of birth should not even occur. It&rsquo;s only required for the CV.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll be able to say &ldquo;shubham&rdquo; when death occurs. Death has no meaning for you. The only sentiment about it is that you have to dispose off the body.</li>
<li>You mind find the functions of the body declining naturally, but you don&rsquo;t feel the burden of being impatient and old guy. You&rsquo;re immortal.</li>
<li><strong>Once the idea of birth is purged the idea of old age and death will be purged automatically.</strong> Something like katrtvam is gone by itself when bhoktrtvam is dismissed.</li>

<li>Jumping from sat to asat (death) and vice versa (birth) is not acceptable. Pair of sat and asat remain distinct.</li>
<li>You can say about yourself only this much &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&rdquo;. Whatever you add to it (the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of I&rsquo;m), all of it, is false. The &ldquo;how&rdquo; of I&rsquo;m is false. This is the shortest path to self-realization.</li>

<li>Abhyupagama: when you&rsquo;re not understanding what I&rsquo;m not saying I go along with what you think. Instead of having a debate with you and trying to convince you.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not connected with you (and your movement, one of which is the birth) silly mind - asangatah.</li>
<li>If you really grow up, you&rsquo;d put the body aside. Like soldiers.</li>
<li>One should outgrow the body and body based early in life (30&rsquo;s or 40&rsquo;s) so you can dedicate the rest of the live to self-realization. Instead we accumulate knowledge about self-realization.</li>
<li>Sastra says that the soldiers who puts his body out of the way on the battlefields and a jnani who puts his body away in understanding of the true self both reach brahman.</li>
<li>The one who knows (looks at) the mind is the witness of the mind. You cannot explain more than that. The witness is known to you because you&rsquo;re the witness.</li>
<li>Being the witness is same as knowing the movement of the mind and the body. Being the witness helps you to know what you&rsquo;re not. You become free from false ideas and false desires.</li>
<li><strong>You need not know what you&rsquo;re. E.g. when you&rsquo;re healthy, you&rsquo;ll not know that you&rsquo;re healthy.</strong></li>
<li>If the mind is restless you don&rsquo;t worry. Let it be restless. You (witness) have no connection with that.</li>
<li><strong>You cannot and need not control the smoke (mind) coming out of the incense stick (body). Let it be in peace. You&rsquo;re the glow (light).</strong></li>
<li><strong>See, you need not close the eyes. But see without raga dvesha, which is the movement of the mind</strong> - your associations. <strong>BE ALERT, BE AWARE OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE MIND. DON&rsquo;T IDENTIFY WITH THE MIND.</strong> The mind comes with a response to what is heard/seen &hellip; a reaction.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re hurt whatever you do is a reaction and that will show you in a poor light. If you don&rsquo;t identify you won&rsquo;t be hurt. And you can say &ldquo;sir, you&rsquo;ve got it all wrong. Have a good day&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Unless there is self-identification with the mind, you won&rsquo;t be hurt.</strong></li>
<li>There is nothing worth keeping in this world. There is nothing worth worrying about if you lose it in this world.</li>
<li><strong>Develop &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; approach. If the mind wants to have raga dvesha, let it have. I&rsquo;m kutastah.</strong> With self-ID you only reinforce raga dvesha.</li>

<li>The words, the symbols have become more important that the search for reality. <strong>Is not the symbol an escape from the real? A fanciful distraction from the real?</strong> The symbols, the ceremony, the festivities.</li>
<li>What is the true religion is not the question. What is not the true religion is the question.</li>
<li>To know the truth you need a very <strong>simple mind. Not a conditioned mind. Not a mind full of descriptions, words, names, rituals.</strong> A mind having an agenda for everybody around.</li>
<li>What is the content of the religion I hold on to? I suggest words and words only.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t want to think and we don&rsquo;t want to find out. That is our problem. We want some sensation, some stimulation in name of fanciful distraction. To think is very painful.</li>
<li>Beyond the words is the creative reality which is the atma.</li>
</ul>
