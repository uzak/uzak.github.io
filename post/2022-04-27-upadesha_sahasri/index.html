In jnanam there is only instruction, no handing over. Like there is in religion - handing over a mantra. The one instructing you can call <strong>instructor</strong>.</li><li>You need not instruct nobody to go to a physician when he&rsquo;s ill. But <strong>when the psyche is ill, nobody will even acknowledge that he&rsquo;s sick</strong>. And when somebody points out that you&rsquo;re sick in the mind, you become angry. Diagnosis: worldliness -> frustration, agitation. The fact that the people become angry shows that they&rsquo;re ill.</li><li><strong>Psychological dimension dominates.</strong> If there is a disorder in this area, your physiological dimension never can become safe and secure.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t overdo anything.</strong> It is a curse. Even for shravanam. When you do, manana and niddidhiasanam are given a go-by.</li><li>You have to lecture yourself. You have to instruct yourself. Look at yourself, look at the mind, and you give a lecture to the mind. That is the <strong>self-instruction. Watch the movement of your mind, be aware of its entire movement</strong>. Without your effort a silence will enter into you. It is the gateway into the real.</li><li><strong>Jnanam - recognising the false as false. You cannot recognise the self. If you recognise it, it becomes the other.</strong></li><li>Health - just cessation of roga. Becoming normal. No special benefit.</li><li><strong>When there is a disorder in the subtle, the gross becomes the victim.</strong> Medicine for the subtle is <strong>dispassion</strong> (viraga, vayragyam).</li><li>How to get the dispassion? First viveka, then vayragyam.</li><li><strong>Inquire</strong>. Woman might not inquire. Man should inquire. Why should men inquire. Even woman should have some gold, but not the passion. Passion is wrong. It is developed out of wrong thinking.</li><li>The fever is the trshnah, greed. Intense attachment to sense pleasures. Wealth and pleasure. All the commercials, <strong>advertisements are meant to attract people towards them. To create a sensation in the mind of a person, to occupy the mental space of the people and inject this passion, greed, attachment to pleasures into the mind.</strong> The defect by which the immunity is compromised is that <strong>the mind wants always more</strong>. Vulnerability of seeking more. Regarding any sense pleasure: food, money, watching TV etc.</li><li><strong>Close your eyes and notice whether the sense of more is coming again and again. Finally tell yourself you do not need more</strong>. In fact, you do not need anything. It is the body that needs some food.</li><li>To realize your true self you need to have a healthy mind in a healthy body. Body has cancer. Mind has trshna. You satisfy it and comes again back and wants more.</li></ul><h2 id=class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvro5r-s78mum><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro5r-s78MuM" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 2</a></h2><ul><li>The fever of the mind - attachment to the sense pleasures. Intense desires. Medicine - jnana viraga bhesayam.</li><li><strong>Body is the instrument of action and therefore needs to be put to action. Medicine for it will be physical. Mind is the instrument of cognition. Any irregularity, illness in the mind will be cognitive in nature. Medicine will be cognitive - understanding of what is the self and what is non-self</strong>.</li><li>viraga follows naturally from viveka. The combination of these two is the medicine.</li><li>&ldquo;<strong>What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; is a fundamentally flawed attitude. You&rsquo;re not supposed to work for a reward. But for the love of the work.</strong> Reward is anatma and therefore unreal. Your dispassion is in question again.</li><li><strong>Practice viveka and vairagya just like you breath-in and breath-out. You&rsquo;re not thinking of any reward. This is the very spontaneity and this is also effortless.</strong></li><li>trsnah is the abnormal. It is the single source of illness. It will manifest in the body.</li><li><strong>Elimination of illness is the benefit. You remain what you are, normal. There is no positive benefit for any medicine.</strong></li><li>Identification with the desired object is the infection, the origin of the mental fever.</li><li>In Sanskrit &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; and &ldquo;taking a birth&rdquo; are considered the same.</li><li>Today&rsquo;s morning person is born out of the yesterday&rsquo;s desiring person.</li><li><strong>Give up the desire for sukhah and you will not know what is dukhah.</strong></li><li>You&rsquo;re the atma, you&rsquo;re aware of the movement of the mind. You&rsquo;ll address, lecture the mind. You&rsquo;re the guru to you. <strong>In identification you&rsquo;re the mind. In disidentification you&rsquo;re the atma.</strong> Buddha: be a light upon yourself.</li></ul><h2 id=class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdnjv2kt8hpy---center-prisoner-of-space-and-time><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNJV2kt8HPY" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 3</a> - center, prisoner of space and time</h2><ul><li>Opposite of being aware of your own consciousness (which is not in motion) is not alert. You&rsquo;re identified with the mind. You&rsquo;re one with the flow, you do not have any space with reference to this flow. You&rsquo;re a samsari.</li><li>Be a witness to the mind. You&rsquo;re looking at the mind. Mind is the other. In doing so you&rsquo;ve discovered the mental space in reference to the mind. Now the mental states do not define you. You&rsquo;re aware of them. There is sukha, there is duhka. But you don&rsquo;t become sukhi, you don&rsquo;t become dukhi.</li><li>Most of the people are followers. Not thinkers.</li><li>The calamity the mind has created for us is aham and mama.</li><li>Look at yourself. There is a center in you. What is it? A bunch of memories. That is the &ldquo;me&rdquo;. It is the result of time. A center has always a space around it. And the space is bounded. As long as there is a center, there is circumference and the bounded space occupied by limited things. You created this prison.</li><li>Some people say I&rsquo;m free. I&rsquo;ve free will. There is no free will separate from the supreme will. It is like the prisoner saying I&rsquo;m free between the prison walls.</li><li>All the concepts outside of his space become extraordinarily important for the prisoner. In spite of acquiring all the concepts (religion, culture, family, etc.) he&rsquo;s still in prison. As long as there is the center there is no freedom. There center always creates space. No matter how big it will be it will be still limited. Prisoner of space and time.</li><li>Do your job. Do everything with tremendous vitality. But you don&rsquo;t need a center for it.</li><li>The moment you&rsquo;re asking for a method you&rsquo;re creating time.</li><li>Me is the jiva. It creates duality. There is a bigger me called God. Dvaitam is the product of me.</li><li>Look at the rising sun with the eyes of the gayatri manta. You&rsquo;ll not experience any division between yourself and the sun. Like looking at the beloved person. There is no me in you. Me vanishes. You the pure being, are just looking at another expression of your self. Without center-me you&rsquo;ll experience a vast space.</li><li>Me is the complex thing. The real simplicity is looking at things without me.</li><li>It is possible to live in the world without &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo;.</li><li><strong>Sankhyas: posit the individual separate from the mind movement. There is a person called jiva and they called it atma. Atma is many. And then there is the mind moving and the mind is moving for the benefit of atma. First create me out of the movement of the mind and then say the movement of mind is meant for the benefit of this me.</strong> Mind is moving and creating sukha/dukha benefit for the jiva. All movement of the mind is meant for the multiple jivas called atma too.</li></ul><h2 id=class-4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfryppkhtoi---mind-as-machine><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfRYppkHtOI" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 4</a> - mind as machine</h2><ul><li><strong>The only calamity in life is &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; syndrome.</strong> The first three purushartas are centered around me and mine and they strengthen the syndrome.</li><li>Sankhya example (wrong): chariot (mind) moves for the benefit of the master (atma). If mind moves the right way, atma gets joy, otherwise suffering. Atma is connected to pleasure and pain, atma becomes the bokta and mind is the karta.</li><li>Oh silly mind how can you create situations of enjoyment to me, the atma? You don&rsquo;t have sentience, you&rsquo;re jada. You cannot do nothing by itself. Also, atma doesn&rsquo;t need any enjoyment generated by the mind.</li><li><strong>Mind is a machine. Mere machine. It has a process, it functions and produces something. The thought process.</strong></li><li>Mind receives the sensations, converts the sensations into experience, then gives a label to the experience and records the experience. Next time the thought comes out of this memory.</li><li><strong>What is outside is always fresh and new.</strong> But the sensation goes into the mind, the mind compares and contrasts and makes it into a repetition. Even when you look at your spouse in the morning, you&rsquo;re looking at her freshly. But the mind makes it a repetition. It converts the present into past. Mind can only be repetitive. It can never have something original. Original comes from something more deep down.</li><li>What is before you is fresh, the sensation is fresh. But mind makes it repetitive. The thought can never be fresh. <strong>Thought is always a response of the memory. Therefore thought can never be creative.</strong></li><li>When you can never produce anything original (mind), better keep quiet (atma).</li><li>Controlled mind (hathayoga) is not a free mind.</li><li>When the mind becomes silent, it becomes knowledgable about its own movement. <strong>Quiet mind means freedom from thinking. Why are you sorrowful or excited? Because you&rsquo;re thinking.</strong> Why are you conflicted? Because the thought produces the conflict.</li><li><strong>Freedom from thinking is moksha.</strong></li><li>If your mind is moving slowly, you don&rsquo;t have many thoughts.</li><li>In jumping from one thought to the other you&rsquo;ve become a victim of memory.</li><li>Mind is creating thoughts. Thought is from the memory, from the past.</li><li>When memory is put aside you&rsquo;re experiencing freshness. That brings out the creative being in you.</li><li><strong>Knowledge - pious name given to the memory.</strong></li><li><strong>When you know your mind, the limits of your mind, you&rsquo;re beyond the mind.</strong></li><li>We don&rsquo;t come across human beings, but across human doings (doctor, teacher, engineer, ..).</li><li>Does your mediation spring from time or is timeless? Your meditation is also a doing. The real meditation is the essence of life. Is being aware of the mind. There is no phalam for it. It is a merger with the timelessness.</li></ul><h2 id=class-5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx49szimd4uo><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49szimd4Uo" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 5</a></h2><ul><li>&ldquo;Be a light unto yourself&rdquo; - Buddha&rsquo;s last advice to his disciples.</li><li><strong>Generally when people are alone they remain occupied. They indulge in a variety of thoughts.</strong> Instead try to watch your mind. Very soon, you&rsquo;ll be bored. That means you&rsquo;re not comfortable with looking at your mind. Therefore <strong>address the mind: &ldquo;mind, I&rsquo;m always contented. I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re or not.&rdquo;</strong></li><li><strong>As long as you&rsquo;re with the thoughts of the mind. You remain discontented. Fullness you never get by identifying with the mind.</strong></li><li>People are not contented at all. Moving from one to another. From one relationship to another. From one religion to another. For what? They&rsquo;re all dogmatic. They think, that through such movement of change they will find happiness. Meaning they are unhappy to start with.</li><li>Change for the sake of change or because you&rsquo;re bored/disenchanted with one thing, or because you&rsquo;re unhappy to start with, will never make you happy.</li><li>Contentment is true when you remain <strong>without any desire to change</strong>. If the change happens naturally I&rsquo;m not resisting.</li><li><strong>The trouble begins with comparing what you have with somebody else</strong> and therefore you want to change. You&rsquo;d live a life without comparison. First compare, next condemn and then become unhappy.</li><li><strong>I learn to live with my lot</strong>. I do not compare, I do not condemn. I desire no change. Any change that happens naturally is OK.</li><li><strong>When you&rsquo;re not comparing you&rsquo;re looking at the things as they are.</strong></li><li>Advise the mind to remain healthy by becoming quiet. Desires make the mind dull.</li><li>Religious-minded persons should be extra careful. Entire religion seems to have one purpose - get you what you seek.</li><li><strong>We&rsquo;re speaking of contentment, not speaking of indulgence, laziness.</strong> Contentment is timelessness. Desire for change is always time. We&rsquo;re not waiting for future.</li><li>Hope is no better than desire as far as creating psychological time is concerned.</li><li>When a thought or feeling arises, just watch it. Be aware of it. Out of it comes silence. That&rsquo;s meditation! You&rsquo;re not asking, not striving for silence. It naturally happens.</li></ul><h2 id=class-6httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyqfinphqina><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqfiNphqInA" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 6</a></h2><h2 id=class-7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzkepb5wx6s><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkEpB5Wx6s" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 7</a></h2><h2 id=class-8httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtk9veq6nada><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9veq6naDA" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 8</a></h2><h2 id=class-9httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqtruyw9uxru><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTrUYW9UxrU" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 9</a></h2><h2 id=class-10httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfm8oozj-s_i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm8oozj-S_I" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 10</a></h2><h2 id=class-11httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvocrrxfpzspo><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCRRxFpZSpo" target=_blank rel=noopener>Class 11</a></h2></article></div><section class=article-navigation><p><a class=link href=/post/2022-04-25-systems_de-engineering/><span class=li></span>Systems' de-Engineering</a class="link"></p></section><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=uzak/uzak.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOGkA1Jg data-category=Q&A data-category-id=DIC_kwDOGkA1Js4CO1WV data-mapping=title data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-theme=light data-lang=en-US crossorigin=anonymous async></script></section><script charset=utf-8>window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",()=>{const e=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(e=>{const t=e.target.getAttribute("id");e.intersectionRatio>0?document.querySelector(`nav li a[href="#${t}"]`).parentElement.classList.add("active"):document.querySelector(`nav li a[href="#${t}"]`).parentElement.classList.remove("active")})});document.querySelectorAll("h2[id]").forEach(t=>{e.observe(t)})})</script><aside class=toc><details open><summary class=toc-title>Table of Contents</summary><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#class-1httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlt2ymnfxqwa><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt2YMNFxqwA">Class 1</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvro5r-s78mum><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro5r-s78MuM">Class 2</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdnjv2kt8hpy---center-prisoner-of-space-and-time><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNJV2kt8HPY">Class 3</a> - center, prisoner of space and time</a></li><li><a href=#class-4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfryppkhtoi---mind-as-machine><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfRYppkHtOI">Class 4</a> - mind as machine</a></li><li><a href=#class-5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx49szimd4uo><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49szimd4Uo">Class 5</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-6httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyqfinphqina><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqfiNphqInA">Class 6</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzkepb5wx6s><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkEpB5Wx6s">Class 7</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-8httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtk9veq6nada><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9veq6naDA">Class 8</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-9httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqtruyw9uxru><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTrUYW9UxrU">Class 9</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-10httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfm8oozj-s_i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm8oozj-S_I">Class 10</a></a></li><li><a href=#class-11httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvocrrxfpzspo><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCRRxFpZSpo">Class 11</a></a></li></ul></nav></details></aside><section id=footer class="footer max-body-width"><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>©2022 Martin Uzak</p></div><div class=footer-wrap><a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh target=_blank rel=noopener>CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a><span> | </span><a href=/index.xml target=_blank rel=noopener>RSS</a></div><div class=footer-wrap><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://github.com/qdzhang/hugo-notepadium-mod target=_blank rel=noopener>Notepadium-mod</a></p></div><div class=footer-wrap><a onclick='window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"smooth"})'>^ TOP ^</a></div></section></div></body></html>
