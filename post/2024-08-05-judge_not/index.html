You don&rsquo;t really get rid of ego. Is part of your machinery as man.</li><li>Get on with life. Attend what is there to attend and forget about your ego. When you do what you love you forget about yourself in the process.</li><li>What do I do about highs and lows? Just like weather, nothing.</li><li><em>Little bed, early to rise, makes the man healthy, wealthy and wise.</em></li><li>When I was a little boy &ldquo;psychology&rdquo; was not even invented. We&rsquo;ve lost touch with common sense. We&rsquo;ve become so unnatural.</li><li>How to make the world a better place? With 20 years old I tried to do physically, now I pray.</li><li>Father: mother knows man. As young man: nature knows man. Now: <strong>God knows best. Prayer is aligning myself with that. Jesus: into thy hands, oh Lord.</strong> I try to surrender not only myself but everything which is contained in my consciousness. There is no better way in which I can serve the world. God knows and I do not but I have faith that this is the best thing I can do.</li><li>One of the most damaging aspects of the ego - judging and critizising others. Jesus: judge not! Judging puts our selves in prison. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right and he&rsquo;s wrong&rdquo;. Let God be the judge.</li><li>Wars are like futball matches. You support one side and cheer when your side makes a goal.</li><li>Ego builds up subsitute reality and the idea that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m separate&rdquo;. <strong>In the beginning the one man - Adam, the spiritual man, lived in paradise. Yet his wife stole what they were told not to steal. They stole like we&rsquo;re stealing from the world. So they got cast out and divided.</strong></li><li>To be one - not to be divided at all. Come back to that primal state of being in paradise.</li><li>regular daily practice of turning to god. Meditation and prayer. This will lead the way and the ego falls behind. You simply grow out of it, of this childish selfishness.</li><li>Quote from Johns book &ldquo;Wonders of Spiritual Enfoldment&rdquo;: <strong>there is no more expectation of comfort or reliability in man, nor desire for the things of creation.</strong> World - a marvelous order of things including the disorder of man. But I feel ever less moved to participate.</li><li>Constant longing for god has become reality now.</li><li><strong>You don&rsquo;t lose it, you can&rsquo;t find it.</strong> It&rsquo;s just part of you, you merge into it. God&rsquo;s no longer something separate and you&rsquo;re fine. <strong>&ldquo;Know I&rsquo;m with you always&rdquo;.</strong></li><li>This is a billion times more effective than psychologists.</li><li>When you find this infinite presence there are no more questions, not more problems. Completion. Wonderful.</li><li>There is nothing, nothing that isn&rsquo;t loved in this world. Even terrorists.</li><li>Ego is separate and makes everything else separate. We end up in living in a world of names.</li><li>Life of separation, life of name and form. Melt them.</li><li>Demonstrate my confidence in silence and not speaking. Show my disinterest in all that talking. Greater value mediate. Less talking</li></ul><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
