That proves it&rsquo;s the only evolutionary stable strategy under these circumstances. The more unpredictable image you project, the more cautious the malevolent actors will be.</p><p>If your honour prohibits you to give concessions and the malevolent one truly thinks so, he won&rsquo;t make demands. Furthermore, if he thinks you are unpredictable, he&rsquo;ll be afraid to provoke you.</p><p>The confrontation is not a kinetic conflict. It is a social game built on mythos, beliefs and psyops. Malevolent powers purposefully project unpredictable image to scare you into submission. They pretend to be determined, unbending, uncompromising so there&rsquo;s no point in resisting.</p><p>This makes sense. Power is mythical in nature and once the mythos is gone, power is gone too. Any misconvenience (in this case rotten meat in soup) can spark a revolt.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s sum up. International conflict is not a kinetic clash of inanimate powers. It&rsquo;s a confrontation of two human collectives consisting of animate creatures united by a mythos.</p><p>International relations are sometimes quite similar to the prison relations. In both cases you are locked with malevolent actors who want and can hurt you. And you can&rsquo;t get anywhere. Don&rsquo;t give concessions.</p><p>the malevolents forces you face are animate. They are human institutions coordinated by a mythos. If the mythos is gone, they&rsquo;re gone too. Fortunately with time passing, their hubris grows and they start acting stupidly. If you don&rsquo;t fall for a psyop, they lose.</p><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
