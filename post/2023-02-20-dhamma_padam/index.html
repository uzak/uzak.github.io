Shankara was a hidden buddhist. Swami TV: Buddha is an open buddhist.</li><li><strong>Buddha dismissed cast and gender distinctions. All are human being. That was most unpalatable for the orthodox ritualists</strong>.</li><li><strong>When you hate something, you invent (folklore) stories</strong>.</li><li><strong>Human society wants a villain. Unless there is a villain there is no target they can put all their vehemence against.</strong></li><li>The orthodox made Buddha a villain because he didn&rsquo;t agree with the violence (against the animals) of the karmakhanda. And then they made stories.</li><li>Prakrta is the language of the people. Sanskrta is the language of the elite.</li><li>Shankara wrote his bhasyas in the language of the people, which was at his time Sansrkt. Pali was the prakrta in the time of Buddha.</li><li>Buddha is different from Bauddhas. Bauddhas have understood Buddha in their own way. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything clearly about the transcendental. Buddhism is different from Buddha&rsquo;s teachings.</li><li>Dhamma Pada is a book of life.</li><li><strong>Jesus Christ was not a religionist. He did not create a religion. He was a philosopher and advaita vedantin.</strong></li><li>Indian Society is not a law abiding civilization, but a dharma abiding civilization. Europe and US is a law abiding civilization.</li><li>Vivekananda: <strong>Study Gita-Krishna, don&rsquo;t bother about Radha-Krishna</strong> (Krishna from stories).</li><li><strong>Life is relationships</strong>. Even for sanyasis, there is always a relationship - my students, my teacher, my vedanta, my class, my sampradaya &mldr;</li><li><strong>The value of the thing is not intrinsic. It comes from the mind. Because the mind believes it&rsquo;s valuable.</strong></li><li><strong>When physical things become very important in your live, you&rsquo;ll miss the truth and relationships with other people will get disturbed.</strong> Therefore the mind has more importance as the physical things. And one meaning of dharma is &ldquo;physical thing&rdquo;.</li></ul><h2 id=02---sound-om>02 - sound OM</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnZYdd_42rU">src</a></p><ul><li><strong>What is is real (sat) and your understanding of the real is the truth (satyam). Om is the sound represents the truth.</strong></li><li><strong>We should devote the life to the search for the truth. Alternative is devoting it to artha, kama, dharma and there will be no truth in life. And without the search for the truth of life it will become a wasted life</strong>.</li><li>How not to waste a lot of life? Not by practising a lot more of religion.</li><li>How to begin the search for the truth? With the word &ldquo;OM&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s intonational sound, thus universal. Not alphabetical which is for human beings only.</li><li><strong>First learn to listen! Listen to what? Whatever is there.</strong> Don&rsquo;t judge the sound. Don&rsquo;t name. Don&rsquo;t approve. Don&rsquo;t like. Don&rsquo;t dislike. If you can it means your mind is silent.</li><li>Rshis were listening to the sounds of nature. And they discovered the sound OM.</li><li><strong>All the sects revere the sound OM equally. Even buddhism. What comes after OM, they all differ.</strong> OM is the expression of truth. It is universal, doesn&rsquo;t belong to a particular language. It is the sound of nature.</li><li><strong>I suggest ignore two things: rupa, nama.</strong></li><li><strong>In this world there is nothing auspicious. Everything is a trap, takes away the freedom, binds you. Yet there is opposite of it, the real, which is also called Shiva. It makes you joyous. Where is it? Everywhere. How to represent it - Vishnuh. It&rsquo;s not a person.</strong> How to represent it - &ldquo;that&rdquo;, out of which the 4th case is &ldquo;tasmai&rdquo;. That is how do it the Upanishads.</li><li><strong>Gurudom - people are waiting for the truth to be told. This has come from the ritualism. You put the proper dress on, sit and wait to be told.</strong> The same spirit bring the sishyas to the Vedanta class. In learning you discuss together, inquire together and with open mind you examine and explore.</li><li>(Vedantic) meditation means reflection, contemplation.</li><li>sa:Arahan = most deserving.</li><li>There are two jobs in Indian society for which you need no qualification what-so-ever. Politics and gurudom.</li><li>Acharya is the one who walks the talk.</li><li>Swami Vivekanda: <strong>Buddha may or may not believed in personal god. That does not matter to me. He reached the same state of perfection to which others come by bhakti, yoga or jnana.</strong> They lead to state of perfection and Buddha has reached this state. Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor cast, nor priest, nor custom. He fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him. Such a <strong>fearless search for truth, that is Buddha.</strong> Such love for any living thing, the world has never seen.</li><li>Buddha himself believes in some sort of eternal being. It can be seen from his utterances. He doesn&rsquo;t give the name &ldquo;Brahma&rdquo; to it. His name is &ldquo;Damma&rdquo;.</li><li>There is no knowing in the future. By putting it in the future, you&rsquo;ve blocked any possibility of knowing the truth. There cannot be any understanding in the psychological future. But <strong>we say we&rsquo;ll understand and we&rsquo;re sure the guru understands. This is called fanaticism.</strong> You don&rsquo;t know but are so sure the guru knows. What you&rsquo;re getting is a bunch of ideas - ideation.</li><li><strong>The idea is not the thing, the word is not the thing.</strong> Knowing the word &ldquo;jackfruit&rdquo; nor having an idea about it is not the truth. <strong>People worship ideas. Think they know the truth.</strong></li><li><strong>Parampara - passing on of ideas. And you become sorrowful and insecure. Or did you become a joyous person after ideation?</strong></li><li>Soon brahmachari will be <strong>burdened by knowledge.</strong></li><li>Being a knowledgable person, standing on a high pedestal, he&rsquo;s got an agenda for the whole society, whole world. He looks down upon the people. He doesn&rsquo;t have any love for the people.</li><li><strong>When you learn the truth it doesn&rsquo;t accumulate</strong>.</li><li>In atmabodha there is no accumulation, only learning. In tattvabodha there is only accumulation, no learning. People want the burden of accumulation, not the joy of learning.</li><li>Buddha loves the people. He doesn&rsquo;t take part in the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.</li><li>Be cautious that it is learning, not accumulation. Buddha was ruthless, he said that metaphysical mumbo-jumbo is not for me.</li><li>Another meaning for &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; is &ldquo;people&rdquo;. The individual, not a person.</li><li>Your body is in the world. But <strong>the world is not outside of your mind. It is outside of your body.</strong></li><li>Mind produces thoughts. Consciousness is the entire movement of the mind. All experience of life is in the mind. Mind is frequency.</li><li>You experience the pain in the body but it stems from the mind. Immunity to corona virus is in the mind.</li><li>Manahpurvahgamah = individual - the one who moves along the mind. You go wherever mind takes you. You&rsquo;re what your mind is.</li><li>In this conglomerate of the body and mind, what is the supreme? Mind is the supreme.</li></ul><h2 id=03---desirelessness>03 - desirelessness</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLdBvIWVG3E">src</a></p><ul><li>People find it easy to believe, difficult to think. Easy to follow, difficult to define their own way.</li><li>Buddha has so much love for the people that he understands.</li><li><strong>We become very skillful with transcendental speculation.</strong></li><li>Buddha pulls the metaphysical Brahma into the empirical Dhamma. One and the same, they are not different. Shankara does the same. There is really no difference.</li><li>When you embrace a person you love, tell yourself it is mortal. This will prevent you from becoming an emotional entity.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t become an intellectual. You&rsquo;ll find it difficult to love people, because you&rsquo;ll be standing on a higher pedestal. Relationships also will become very soar.</strong></li><li>Your body must not be the body, the emotions, the intellect but the truth. The home in which you live is called sharanam. Buddha calls it Dhamma.</li><li>Shankara never refutes Buddha, he refutes buddhism only.</li><li><strong>The mind (another name is &ldquo;psychology) is an integral part of the nature. It is not separate.</strong> It is not that you&rsquo;re a person and have your own mind. Human consciousness, the movement of the mind, is the same. <strong>Also the same for physiology. Your body is part of nature.</strong> The person is throwing mud at you. You do not feel bad about the person. Mind creates things, e.g. conflict. And then believes the conflict is real.</li><li><strong>The very idea of &ldquo;else&rdquo;, of &ldquo;other&rdquo; is a calamity. The mind creates a lot of mischief.</strong></li><li>Thought -> speech -> action.</li><li><strong>Religious leader gives you a list why there is suffering in the world. Every point is a miss.</strong></li><li>There is no end to the monstrosity of ignorance. You don&rsquo;t need to educate people. At least don&rsquo;t push them into ignorance. Buddha: look at your mind. That is the culprit.</li><li>7 Sins: salt, sugar, stress, sleeplessness, sepsis, spirit + one more.</li><li>Desire is an impurity. <strong>Do not entertain any desire about anything on which you do not have any command.</strong> Remind yourself that all things are unreal and all people are mortal.</li><li>Marah here is used as synonym for kama (desire).</li><li><strong>All fears arise out of desire only.</strong></li><li><strong>Prasadah is not eating food. Prasadah is a mind with clarity and cheerfullness.</strong></li><li>People are anxious about healing the body. You have to heal the mind (first). When you heal the mind you seldom become sick.</li><li><strong>When there is a desire lingering you&rsquo;re tense.</strong></li><li><strong>Gossip is a direct outcome of jealousy.</strong></li><li>Vivekananda: <strong>desirelessness and fearlessness is godliness. The consciousness has become one with the godliness. It is already godliness. Hence you do not remember god separate of you.</strong></li><li>Upanishads: the moment the person becomes desireless that moment he becomes immortal and that moment he becomes one with brahma.</li></ul><h2 id=04>04</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-yPiMW_PXk">src</a></p><ul><li>Listen to the sounds, far as well as near, without naming. You&rsquo;re now establish in what is called sakshi bhavah. You&rsquo;re not a person anymore.</li><li><strong>First sanyasin was actually Buddha.</strong></li><li>Buddha declined to define the nature of the absolute reality. He contented himself with negative description. So do upanishads.</li><li>When superstition comes from great acharyas you have to call it sophistry. <strong>It is difficult to draw a line between the superstition of the ignorant people and sophistry of the learned.</strong></li><li>Traditional - whatever doesn&rsquo;t fall within the narrow vision is labeled as non-traditional and non-worthwhile. That&rsquo;s sophistry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the right person to speak about it, sit down&rdquo;.</li><li>You have to find a light in yourselves. You cannot rely entirely upon a physical entity called guru. But ultimately you&rsquo;re your own guide.</li><li>Religious way of life is not where rituals but wisdom dominates. Superstition is loaded with fear.</li><li>Prasada - clarity in thinking, charity in feeling in mind and in action.</li><li>When you play the same tune you stop thinking about it. Without thinking you develop an attachment to it.</li><li>You get a feeling that you&rsquo;re familiar with it even without knowing it. There is so much knowledge but no learning. Knowledge accumulates, learning does not.</li><li><strong>Knowledge is professional. Learning is loaded with love.</strong></li><li><strong>If you&rsquo;re caught in a structure you won&rsquo;t be able to listen to anything new, thinking in an original way. You know only to move in a groove.</strong></li><li>Art of listening. Give full attention. Listen with entire operation of the thought, which is but memory, at bay. That is how you have to listen to the scriptures. Keep all the knowledge you&rsquo;ve accumulated on Vedanta aside.</li><li><strong>Thinking and stress go together. Stress has its origin in thought.</strong></li><li><strong>When you listen with full attention, you&rsquo;re fully relaxed. In the very act of listening, the old tape gets wiped out.</strong></li><li>You have to find a way of living, which is not dependent on any belief. Where a very creative thinking guides the life.</li><li>Prasadah: the circumstances around do not impact you. The quality of life is always free, young (not biologically), vital&mldr;</li><li>The old ways of thinking, the repetition of old patterns and repetition of living and acting come to an end when you pay attention.</li><li>Are you serious about finding a way of live where there is no misery, no turmoil? Than you have to get rid of the old habit of thought. E.g. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m somebody&rdquo;.</li><li><strong>Through the old habit of thought we get caught in the samsara. I&rsquo;m somebody, I&rsquo;m such and such and I want to fulfill myself. Why?</strong> That is selfishness. Why should you fulfill yourself or become something? You&rsquo;d know what you&rsquo;re. You need not become anything other than you&rsquo;re.</li><li><strong>&ldquo;I believe in my opinions&rdquo;. They are not your opinions! Somebody has put them there.</strong></li><li>There is so much fragmentation. All fragmentation leads to confusion.</li><li>Find for yourself what is the right way of thinking and living. <strong>You&rsquo;ve to find that wisdom in yourself by yourself.</strong></li><li>In the inner movement only creative thinking and learning (which is in the present), not memory, helps.</li><li><strong>Religions promise to heal the mind. They won&rsquo;t do it. You have to take your life in your hands.</strong></li><li>Child-Like mind not childish mind.</li><li>Buddha&rsquo;s <strong>loving kindness meditation</strong>: to get rid of injustice towards me and hate.</li><li>Nobody can hurt you. Only your actions, your thoughts, the way you conduct your relationships. Unless you allow the other person to hurt you, nobody can hurt you.</li></ul><h2 id=05>05</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtWLYUmVcS8">src</a></p><ul><li>All people are frustrated. With their places, jobs, relationships, marriages, family life to sanyasa &mldr; hoping to find something better. Bhagavan Buddha is acting out this frustration.</li><li><strong>Science and technology doesn&rsquo;t divide people. It unites them. Indian aeroplane can be flown by a German guy. Whereas religion, belief system, divides people.</strong> You feel animosity spontaneously to an unknown person for the simple reason that he is not your co-religionist.</li><li><strong>Ideology is nothing but an idea highlighted and blown-up to very big proportions as if it is the truth. Ideologs are not peaceful, but very frustrated, agitated and unhappy people.</strong></li><li><strong>Fulfillment and frustration are interrelated. Fulfillment of what?</strong> Goal, desire of the mind.</li><li>Frustration is but a form of hate only.</li><li>Jealousy is nothing but hatred.</li><li><strong>Sensation is another name for thought. You&rsquo;ve got a pleasant sensation, fulfilment - that&rsquo;s thought. Thought is not love. Love is the flame and thought is the smoke.</strong></li><li><strong>Love has no opposite. There will be always an opposite for thought.</strong></li><li>Love is like water. It is not limited by a given vessel. When you think of it, do you think of a particular vessel? Is it meant to be partaken by a given person?</li><li>When you know love you&rsquo;ve known god. What people usually have is attachment.</li><li>Heart is burdened by the things of the head.</li><li><strong>You cannot find a rich man happy. He&rsquo;s a slave to his riches.</strong> He&rsquo;s an unhappy person. There is sorrow in him, even though he might not give expression to it.</li><li>Buddha is sensitive to sorrow in all.</li><li>Preamble of the constitution of <strong>UNESCO: since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.</strong></li><li>Swami TV: there is every reason to be frustrated. But I&rsquo;m not frustrated. I&rsquo;m ecstatic? No. I&rsquo;m a simple person living my life. Yet I don&rsquo;t feel any hate. It&rsquo;s just a matter of paying attention.</li><li>Sometimes in a given context it&rsquo;s inappropriate not to be frustrated.</li><li>sa:sham-a (to douse, to extinguish) becomes sa:shantih.</li><li>Examine your thought process. As long as it (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m somebody&rdquo;, &ldquo;I deserve&rdquo;, &mldr;) is retained in your consciousness, the fire of enmity won&rsquo;t be extinguished.</li><li>To heal psychologically is more important that to heal physically. Get out of that thought pattern (&ldquo;that somebody has wronged me&rdquo;). You get what you deserve, call it destiny if you want. Stop thinking on that lines.</li><li><strong>Vipashyana meditation. Just watch the breath. Buddha&rsquo;s scheme: meditate 30 days long at a given time. Do it alone.</strong></li><li><strong>Who&rsquo;s right, who&rsquo;s wrong. That&rsquo;s not the point.</strong></li><li>Loving kindness meditation. Practice, once/twice times a week. And then look at your consciousness. The antagonism comes to an end. It is one of the great blessings of bhagavan Buddha.</li><li>Be in dark. Sitting upright is important. At least in the beginning. It takes out the tamoguna. The laziness.</li><li><strong>Alertness and relaxation go together.</strong> They are complimentary.</li></ul><h2 id=06>06</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMBtIFDvic4">src</a></p><ul><li><strong>Law is man-made, dharma is the outcome of the nature which is God.</strong> For us God is not different from nature. What you call nature has God as its substratum.</li><li><strong>Sanatanah means timeless, whereas law is time-bound. Laws also change from space to space. Sometimes even from person to person.</strong> Laws are very changeable.</li><li>Even dharma can change but it&rsquo;s scope is universal. Dharma has its origin in the nature. Dharma is the laws that govern the cosmos. Like you don&rsquo;t want to hurt any other creature because you yourself don&rsquo;t want to be hurt. Ahimsa is dharma, not a law enacted by a king or a ruler.</li><li>Sanatanah can mean perennial (like the sun, which will be exhausted) and timeless like the atma.</li><li>Being. I&rsquo;m. It is the same irrespective of time. Morning, evening, midnight, the I&rsquo;m-ness is the same. Mind is not the same. At office, at home mind is different. I&rsquo;m is not different.</li><li>It is a crazy world in which no guru encourages the student to find the God for himself.</li><li>Upanishadic method: based on the hints you discover what is the God. <strong>In Upanishad the preceptor encourages the student to find the truth.</strong></li><li>What is the truth? Whatever is!</li><li><strong>The thing in it-self. Gold is the thing, not ornament.</strong></li><li>Essence of all the upanishadic upasanas. Look at living (chit) and non-living (jada). That you have around you. Prakuruti. The substratum of this is Ishvara or Brahma. All upanishadic upasanas are based on this principle. Brahma is before as as the intelligence that commands and controls the universe. Sattvaguna. That is hiranyagarbhopasana.</li><li>Even when you&rsquo;re looking at the world you&rsquo;re looking at God. This is the upasana.</li><li>The present day Hindu-Society has moved out of three main pillars of any cultural religion: 1) grantha - the scripture 2) acaryah 3) commitment of the devotees.</li><li>Everybody follow what scriptures he likes.</li><li>Instead of acarayah there are preachers. When there are followers a leader will come up. There is no unified vision.</li><li><strong>Psychological health is far more important than physical.</strong> Mind and body influence each other.</li><li>When the age comes and the psychological health is not in good shape, you&rsquo;ll suffer to no end.</li><li>We concentrate mostly on healing the outward. That is how the popular opinion is. That&rsquo;s why a physician draws large groups of patients.</li><li>Idealogical people are not peaceful people. They don&rsquo;t know what is peace. They are very agitated people. They have enemies. Mahatmas don&rsquo;t.</li><li>Kaliyuga pill-yuga.</li><li><strong>Dharma - clarity in thinking (utterly uncorrupted), charity in thinking, purity action.</strong></li><li>Conflict you have in your heart dissipates the vital energy which you so desperately need to know the truth.</li><li>If there is a conflict. You should not do anything. That is likely to make the conflict worse. Your goal must be to take out the conflict, the hate from the consciousness. If there is a reason, if you feel injustice done to you, go and offer him some flowers or wish him well. Go and help him to come out of his difficulties. Break the cycle of difficulties.</li><li><strong>Replace hostility with love or at least neutralize it.</strong></li><li>The one who is ridiculing or insulting is indeed insulting himself.</li><li>Your mind will tell you the other is your enemy. He&rsquo;s wronged you. You have to teach him a lesson. It is a battle against yourself. Dhammapada says: nahI vayrena vayrani shamyanti. This is the <strong>devAsura samgramah - battle between gods and deamons. God tells you &ldquo;bless your enemy&rdquo;. Inside there is a jiva, separate from god. That person tells you &ldquo;this is the time to strike and take revenge&rdquo;.</strong> You have to decide.</li></ul><h2 id=07>07</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDhaGsz1Yj0">src</a></p><ul><li><strong>As long as you&rsquo;ll justify antagonism it will hurt you.</strong></li><li>Figuratively globalization means the earth is flat. No difference between east and west. It&rsquo;s all a huge mix.</li><li>When a criminal is executed it is not the other that is executed, it is myself. The one who&rsquo;s slain is myself. The one who slains is also myself.</li><li><strong>When my adversary is cheated by me, I&rsquo;m not cheating the adversary, I&rsquo;m cheating myself.</strong></li><li>Before the power of Jesus Christ the Roman Empire came crumbling down. That&rsquo;s the power of love.</li><li>Prayer: &ldquo;Oh God, I forgive my enemies so you can forgive me&rdquo;.</li><li>Always the real revolution comes from within. And that comes only when you understand. Understanding is learning, not knowledge, which is accumulation.</li><li>Greatest mishap is converting Vedanta into accumulative knowledge. In Gita you&rsquo;re supposed to learn and live. In Panini&rsquo;s Grammar, social science or mathematics you&rsquo;re supposed to know and accumulate.</li><li>Understanding has to come from examining the way how you&rsquo;re conducting yourself in a given relationship. Antagonism is always related to a relationship. You cannot have in in thin air.</li><li><strong>There is no justifiable anger</strong>. Ghandi: there is no justifiable violence. <em>British are not enemies. They&rsquo;re our rulers. They should get out. We rule ourself. The demand stays.</em></li><li><strong>When you become angry. Don&rsquo;t condemn yourself. Just watch the movement of anger in you.</strong> Sakshibhava. When you justify, it becomes stronger, when you condemn it becomes stronger. Stop fueling the fire. It will become extinct by itself.</li><li>In Ramayana you do not see one word of hate coming from the mouth of Rama against Ravana. But it&rsquo;s clear that if Ravana comes close to Rama, he&rsquo;ll be slain.</li><li>How a weak-minded person can forgive? <strong>Only strong-minded person can forgive</strong>!</li><li>Marah is the synonym of kamah. Marah is principle of kamah. Kamah is desire, not sex.</li><li><strong>Atma you&rsquo;ll never know. It is infinite. I&rsquo;m understanding, understanding &mldr; understanding.

Game of the mind, senses in conjunction with the objects. Joy is a good word. It is atma, ananda..</li><li><strong>Sins: spirit, sedentary lifestyle, sleeplessness.</strong> Somebody who values physical and psychological heath, a student of vedanta has nothing to do with this.</li><li>Who connects the three: waking person, dream person, no person.

That&rsquo;s a contradiction. <strong>As a student of vedanta you don&rsquo;t have a right to become/feel hurt.</strong></li><li><strong>You get hurt only when your attention is down.</strong></li><li>The person who is trying to hurt you, pay full attention to what he&rsquo;s saying or doing and you&rsquo;ll see you&rsquo;ll not be hurt.</li><li>When you do not have attention, you&rsquo;re focus is scattered in the things of the world, meaning you&rsquo;re mind is moving a lot.

When you&rsquo;re inadvertent your mind is moving a lot. The more you&rsquo;re attentive, the less agitated is the mind.</strong></li><li><strong>Ego is nothing more than a thought.

Apramada - paying attention is immortality.</li><li>Life is a great mystery. It is one, not multiple. Profound and vast. If we do not understand it, if we remain in pramada, we remain fearful. What else ego can be?</li><li>The right spirit comes only when you realize the truth in yourself. Then only the guru is fulfilled, the shastra is fulfilled.</li><li><strong>Self-realization is the goal. Don&rsquo;t allow nothing else to be a distraction.</strong></li><li>Reveling in that attention will make you a very happy person.</li><li><strong>In belief there is vested self-interest.

In thinking there is projection based on conditioning, prejudice or a pre-formulation.</li><li>Thinking dissipates energy. OTOH looking has none of it. We look at what is. I look at myself. That is attention. There is instant freedom.</li><li>I just look at myself, I don&rsquo;t judge myself. This is not easy, we&rsquo;re habituated to judge.</li><li>In looking at myself there is no boundary. It is spacious. That is the real beauty, not physical, but spiritual, which is in the boundlessness, spaciousness, that is looking at myself.</li><li>As long as I look at myself, there is no hint of the world. The world has to wait for your attention.</li><li>As I look at myself, the mind has become quiet. I&rsquo;ve done nothing for it to be quiet. That is what is called samadhi. It doesn&rsquo;t require any effort, any knowledge.</li><li>You need not be a knowledgable person to be yourself. You need knowledge to cook or drive.</li><li>I don&rsquo;t need eyesight to look at myself. I don&rsquo;t need the assistance of thought. I shine by myself (atma jyotihi) by the flame of attention. It doesn&rsquo;t require any other means to experience.</li></ul><h3 id=lecture-1>Lecture</h3><ul><li>First meditation of Bhagavan Buddha was eating a banana.</li><li>You cannot teach anything to scholarly people. You only get a bad name in the process.</li><li>There is a tremendous difference between knowledge and knowing. For knowledge you need a preceptor and a process (method). You need time. And you&rsquo;ll be tested. None of these apply to knowing. You know by yourself, through yourself, in yourself.</li><li>Meditation is emptying the mind of all thoughts. Either you&rsquo;re thinking, or you&rsquo;re meditating.</li><li>Unless your mind is empty, how can you focus on a given thing?</li><li>There is no meditation in multitasking.</li><li>Thought is very useful in accomplishing the things of outer life.</li><li>After utilizing thought, speech, action to the required extent you need freedom from these things. You need to remain thoughtless, silent, quiet.</li><li>Zenmaster: those who worship the pointing finger miss the moon.</li><li>Thought dissipates energy. Stress is the origin of all problems of health, esp. of the cardiac problems. Origin of stress is thought. You think, you generate stress, you dissipate energy. Especially if the thought generates feeling, like thought become desire, fear, anxiety.</li><li>Thought becomes ego. Ego is but a thought. When it becomes too strong it becomes a psychiatric condition - narcissism.</li><li>Another aspect of fearlessness is vayragya (desirelessness).</li><li>Arrogant person is very much afraid in himself. His fear and anxiety express as arrogance.</li><li>One has superiority complex just because he has inferiority complex. There is no superiority complex in psychology.</li><li>If a dog will show some kind of arrogance or aggression and you don&rsquo;t respond, it will go its way.</li><li>There is fear only because of inadvertence.</li><li>Do not judge others through your understanding dispassion. It might be true, but don&rsquo;t say that, don&rsquo;t feel that. People are passionate, that&rsquo;s how people are. Think: &ldquo;until yesterday I was passionate too. I love them in spite of all their passion&rdquo;.</li><li>Love and do what you will. Don&rsquo;t impose your understanding on other people. If they learn (dispassion) by looking at you, that&rsquo;s their problem.</li><li>When the mind is free from thoughts the mind is free from the known. The unknowable comes into its own. That&rsquo;s why pramana has relevance up to a point (realm of the known). The real, the truth is aprameya.</li><li>Mind cannot become free by substituting one set of thoughts by another set of thoughts. Religious thoughts are as much worldly thoughts as other thoughts.</li><li>When a TX has to take place and you have to employ the mind then the flame of attention will brake but it is always with you. And the mind will be used purposefully instead of the mind using you.</li><li>How many hours can you stay without the cellphone at your side?</li><li>You&rsquo;d be able to say &ldquo;enough&rdquo; to the world. It is the same as closing the door to the known. World is the known.</li><li>Instead of saying no to intellect they say no to meditation.</li><li>People want things of this world and similar things of the other world.</li><li>Never introduce psychological time into meditation.</li><li>Things happen only in the now, nothing happens in the future. Now alone is the truth.</li><li>Make meditation timeless. Don&rsquo;t put a goal.

It is not physical nor political freedom. Nirvana is the freedom to think fearlessly. You no more dependent psychologically on outer things.</li><li><strong>Teacher is not a fixed thing. A cloud, leaf, child can teach you. You can learn from anywhere and from everywhere and from anybody and everybody. Those who have one guru have stopped learning long back.</strong></li><li><strong>A sick person cannot teach you. When the body is sick mind cannot be glorious. They are one and the same.</strong></li><li>When I present myself as model, as Vedanta teacher, I&rsquo;ve already psychologically dependant on shishya. When no shishya turn up what kind of teacher I&rsquo;m?</li><li><strong>You won&rsquo;t get nirvana by effort (doing). Watching, thinking, investigating is no effort.</strong> When you become attentive there is no effort.</li><li><strong>Effort is motivated action.</strong></li><li>Effort makes is physically and psychologically sick. Hard work does not make us sick.</li><li>Wife and husband depend on each other psychologically and that is bondage. They cannot stay together in harmony yet quarrel with each other. They assume that psychological dependence is love.</li><li>When a relation makes you suffer, unhappy it cannot be love.</li><li>Is tradition not imitation? Understanding becomes your own.</li><li><strong>You need freedom not to imitate, but to discover.</strong> Discover what God is.</li><li>This is a crazy world because in this world nobody tells you to find for yourself what God is.</li><li>The real is God.</li><li><strong>The modern guru never disappoints you. He hands over the ready-made god to you. Varuna told his son Bhrgu to find out.</strong></li><li>In this world everybody is struggling to arrive at a safe place. It is a crazy place torn in conflicting beliefs, every form of cruelty, of stupidity, class/race distinctions. You desperately need freedom, nirvana.</li><li>Bana means arrow, it stands for suffering in the world. (bana -> vana) nirvana is freedom from the suffering. There is no happiness as long as you&rsquo;re dependent psychologically on things and people.</li><li><strong>You arrive at this liberation when you constantly inquire.</strong></li><li><strong>There is nothing like knowing your self. You can only be yourself.</strong> When you can sit on your shoulders, then you surely can know yourself&mldr; <strong>Expression atmajnanam might be very misleading. Entire Vedanta world is in grip of this misconception.</strong></li><li><strong>You&rsquo;re accustomed to use the power of intellect, intellection, the faculty of knowing to everything. It doesn&rsquo;t work with atma.</strong> The self is beyond the scope of intellect.</li><li>Therefore better replace the word &ldquo;self-knowledge&rdquo; with &ldquo;self-inquiry&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m habituated to belief that I&rsquo;m such and such or am I really such and such?</li><li><strong>There is a big difference between learning and acquiring knowledge.</strong> In case of knowledge it accumulates. It is an additive process. People have this accumulative spirit. As a child you accumulate marbles and other silly things. Then you accumulate knowledge, money, physical objects.</li><li><strong>When you learn a thing it doesn&rsquo;t accumulate.</strong> Electricity gives a shock, fire burns &mldr; this does not accumulate.</li><li><strong>Accumulated knowledge becomes a burden, whereas learning liberates.</strong></li><li>Supposed you assumed you&rsquo;re afraid of something. Then you examine and learn that you&rsquo;re not afraid. What a freedom? That is the nirvana that we&rsquo;re talking about.</li><li><strong>To get the higher you&rsquo;ve to sacrifice the lesser.</strong> Sri Ramakrishna: to go onto the top of a building, you&rsquo;ve to give up the ladder that brought you there.</li><li>Yoga kshema - motivated effort that makes us suffer to no end. That&rsquo;s the bondage.</li><li><strong>I is the life. The universal life. You&rsquo;re bubble in this ocean of life. And the ocean will take care of you. Wave need not take care of itself.</strong></li><li>Atmavan is courageous one, one who never fails to pay attention. <strong>When you pay attention you understand that you don&rsquo;t need yoga (secure what I don&rsquo;t have yet) and kshema (safeguard what I already have).</strong></li><li><strong>Whatever you get it becomes part of our monotonous existence within one week.</strong></li><li>All the things from this side of the line there were at one time on the other side of line. Now they are on this side but they don&rsquo;t make us happy.</li><li>Sri Krishna: give up this effort, this yoga kshema. It is a poisoned bread. Don&rsquo;t have anything to do with it.</li><li><strong>The food that you can&rsquo;t digest, offer it to god. God is Shiva. He can consume poison without harm.</strong></li><li><strong>In a relation, you stop acquiring or seeking personal advantage. The relation will continue, you need not give it up. Then enrich the relation with love by giving. Don&rsquo;t seek anything for yourself in the relation. You&rsquo;ve given up all the suffering that the relation can engender to you.</strong></li><li>When you go to sanyasa, all the mantras are given up. They&rsquo;re not given up, they&rsquo;re merged in you. <strong>You don&rsquo;t give up your wife, son, home, karmas, you merge them in you.</strong></li><li><strong>You resolve everything in you and you alone are there.</strong> There is no contradiction between shravanam and niddidhiasanam.</li><li>Nirvana itself is the greatest yoga kshema. There cannot be a greater one.</li><li><strong>Give up attachment to kshema and the desire for yoga. Inquiry, meditation is the means that takes you to that effortlessness. Sailboat vs. pushing the boat.</strong></li><li><strong>Become purposefully active without desiring anything. A life given to hard work and a lot of toil is not a burden, it is a benediction.</strong></li><li>Knowledge is in the head, learning in the heart. You don&rsquo;t meditate in the head but in the heart.</li><li>Ramana maharshi: spiritual right is on the heart. Anatomical is on the left. Rise above all these things.</li><li><strong>Me and mine syndrome is always in the head. In the heart you have pure impersonal being.

If the lamp wants to save its wick and oil, then the lamp will not have any luster or splendor.</strong> When the lamp constantly wick and oil, glory is the natural consequence.</li><li>Do not seek easy and comfort for the body. If you do you end up wasting the time in sensual pleasures and luxuries. There will be no hope for the person, it won&rsquo;t be fit for self inquiry.</li><li>The Truth is not somewhere, something to grab, not something that can be seen with special means. Truth is in life, in living. Truth is not in a book, not with a person. Truth is with you and it has to manifest in every single thought that comes out of your mind.</li><li><strong>Human body is made for walking. That&rsquo;s the one thing you should never stop doing. Hands are made for working. Mouth for talking a bit and taking nutrients, not talking a lot and seeking enjoyment of food.</strong></li><li><strong>Inactivity is death</strong>. Actionlessness is not inactivity. Activity alone is life.</li><li>In a river water is fresh and clear, in a stagnant pool water is odorous, dirty, stinking. That&rsquo;s the difference between active and sedentary life.</li><li>By ignorance you think you&rsquo;re flowing. And you become a victim to time. With correct understanding you can current from the flow of time into the truth of timelessness. <strong>Living a lazy way is not the way to step out of time.</strong></li><li>River always adapts to the environment.</li><li>River cleans itself (as long as the impurities are within a limit).</li><li><strong>Be like river, constantly working, constantly adapting, constantly assimilating.</strong> And the river merges in the ocean - you become one with Brahman.</li><li><strong>Whatever hurts the other is papam. Whatever helps the other is punyam.</strong></li><li>You should know what is right and you should perform only what is right.</li><li>Sravanam must be of quality teaching. Otherwise leave it alone. A little sravanam is enough, if it is of good quality.</li><li><strong>You&rsquo;d not follow a religious teacher. He&rsquo;s got nothing to teach you, he&rsquo;s got an agenda for you.</strong> True teacher just shares the wisdom with you. Other than that he&rsquo;s got no vested interest.</li><li>You&rsquo;ve to take responsibility for your own enlightenment.</li><li>While walking, be alert. While cooking, while driving, whatever you do, be alert. We lost this spirit of alertness because we&rsquo;ve become very worldly. It is written big on our faces because we practice multi-tasking.</li><li><strong>You need amusement from outside because you&rsquo;re so badly fed up with yourself.</strong></li><li><strong>How long can you sit just by yourself, without doing anything?</strong> Normally you need one distraction or the other. Before one minute ends you&rsquo;ll go for distraction.</li><li>The mind wants to think and think and think. All action originates in thinking. And by the end of day mind gets totally exhausted. <strong>We accumulate a lot of stress just by thinking unnecessarily.</strong></li><li><strong>Replace thinking by attention.</strong></li><li>To begin with attention, use an anchor. Be aware of different parts of body, or the breath. And there will be no thinking.</li><li>Attention is not fixed in space and time. But you can continue with your schedule.</li><li>Breath meditation - vipasanna - gift of Bhagavan Buddha to the world.</li><li>Someone is there only after you wake up. <strong>So do you wake up first and then somebody from the world arises or vice versa?</strong> When you wake up you create the waking consciousness and also the content of waking consciousness and as a part of it somebody waking you up is there.</li></ul><h2 id=23>23</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYPF3WJZA24">src</a></p><h2 id=24>24</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDL7kngHzKA">src</a></p><h2 id=25>25</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugZEsNR_d9Y">src</a></p><h2 id=26>26</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qizU_gglBqc">src</a></p><h2 id=27>27</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz47i8suESw">src</a></p><h2 id=28>28</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dye55eSNwI">src</a></p><h2 id=29>29</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UFjeqxdBRQ">src</a></p><h2 id=30>30</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdqmOT4oaOM">src</a></p><h2 id=31>31</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZpCrOYLbt0">src</a></p><h2 id=32>32</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMEkeKNKvSQ">src</a></p><h2 id=33>33</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL_tRlgpQmE">src</a></p><h2 id=34>34</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev0lG3MD-UU">src</a></p><h2 id=35>35</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Nqug-Q5yg">src</a></p><h2 id=36>36</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRsQrBLkVk">src</a></p><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
