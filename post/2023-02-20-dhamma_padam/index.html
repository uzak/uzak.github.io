<ul>
<li>Buddha was a upanishadah.</li>
<li>Buddha&rsquo;s fear: people will go after speculative religious practices by giving up the search for the truth.</li>
<li>Swami Vivekananda: Buddha was a great vedantist. Shankara was a hidden buddhist. Swami TV: Buddha is an open buddhist.</li>
<li><strong>Buddha dismissed cast and gender distinctions. All are human being. That was most unpalatable for the orthodox ritualists</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>When you hate something, you invent (folklore) stories</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Human society wants a villain. Unless there is a villain there is no target they can put all their vehemence against.</strong></li>
<li>The orthodox made Buddha a villain because he didn&rsquo;t agree with the violence (against the animals) of the karmakhanda. And then they made stories.</li>
<li>Prakrta is the language of the people. Sanskrta is the language of the elite.</li>
<li>Shankara wrote his bhasyas in the language of the people, which was at his time Sansrkt. Pali was the prakrta in the time of Buddha.</li>
<li>Buddha is different from Bauddhas. Bauddhas have understood Buddha in their own way. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything clearly about the transcendental. Buddhism is different from Buddha&rsquo;s teachings.</li>
<li>Dhamma Pada is a book of life.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ was not a religionist. He did not create a religion. He was a philosopher and advaita vedantin.</li>
<li>Indian Society is not a law abiding civilization, but a dharma abiding civilization. Europe and US is a law abiding civilization.</li>
<li>Vivekananda: <strong>Study Gita-Krishna, don&rsquo;t bother about Radha-Krishna</strong> (Krishna from stories).</li>
<li><strong>Life is relationships</strong>. Even for sanyasis, there is always a relationship - my students, my teacher, my vedanta, my class, my sampradaya &hellip;</li>
<li><strong>The value of the thing is not intrinsic. It comes from the mind. Because the mind believes it&rsquo;s valuable.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When physical things become very important in your live, you&rsquo;ll miss the truth and relationships with other people will get disturbed.</strong> Therefore the mind has more importance as the physical things. And one meaning of dharma is &ldquo;physical thing&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is is real (sat) and your understanding of the real is the truth (satyam). Om is the sound represents the truth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We should devote the life to the search for the truth. Alternative is devoting it to artha, kama, dharma and there will be no truth in life. And without the search for the truth of life it will become a wasted life</strong>.</li>
<li>How not to waste a lot of life? Not by practising a lot more of religion.</li>
<li>How to begin the search for the truth? With the word &ldquo;OM&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s intonational sound, thus universal. Not alphabetical which is for human beings only.</li>
<li><strong>First learn to listen! Listen to what? Whatever is there.</strong> Don&rsquo;t judge the sound. Don&rsquo;t name. Don&rsquo;t approve. Don&rsquo;t like. Don&rsquo;t dislike. If you can it means your mind is silent.</li>
<li>Rshis were listening to the sounds of nature. And they discovered the sound OM.</li>
<li>All the sects revere the sound OM equally. Even buddhism. What comes after OM, they all differ. OM is the expression of truth. It is universal, doesn&rsquo;t belong to a particular language. It is the sound of nature.</li>
<li>I suggest ignore two things: rupa, nama.</li>
<li><strong>In this world there is nothing auspicious. Everything is a trap, takes away the freedom, binds you. Yet there is opposite of it, the real, which is also called Shiva. It makes you joyous. Where is it? Everywhere. How to represent it - Vishnuh. It&rsquo;s not a person.</strong> How to represent it - &ldquo;that&rdquo;, out of which the 4th case is &ldquo;tasmai&rdquo;. That is how do it the Upanishads.</li>
<li><strong>Gurudom - people are waiting for the truth to be told. This has come from the ritualism. You put the proper dress on, sit and wait to be told.</strong> The same spirit bring the sishyas to the Vedanta class. In learning you discuss together, inquire together and with open mind you examine and explore.</li>
<li>(Vedantic) meditation means reflection, contemplation.</li>
<li>sa:Arahan = most deserving.</li>
<li>There are two jobs in Indian society for which you need no qualification what-so-ever. Politics and gurudom.</li>
<li>Acharya is the one who walks the talk.</li>
<li>Swami Vivekanda: <strong>Buddha may or may not believed in personal god. That does not matter to me. He reached the same state of perfection to which others come by bhakti, yoga or jnana.</strong> They lead to state of perfection and Buddha has reached this state. Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor cast, nor priest, nor custom. He fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him. Such a <strong>fearless search for truth, that is Buddha.</strong> Such love for any living thing, the world has never seen.</li>
<li>Buddha himself believes in some sort of eternal being. It can be seen from his utterances. He doesn&rsquo;t give the name &ldquo;Brahma&rdquo; to it. His name is &ldquo;Damma&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There is no knowing in the future. By putting it in the future, you&rsquo;ve blocked any possibility of knowing the truth. There cannot be any understanding in the psychological future. But <strong>we say we&rsquo;ll understand and we&rsquo;re sure the guru understands. This is called fanaticism.</strong> You don&rsquo;t know but are so sure the guru knows. What you&rsquo;re getting is a bunch of ideas - ideation.</li>
<li><strong>The idea is not the thing, the word is not the thing.</strong> Knowing the word &ldquo;jackfruit&rdquo; nor having an idea about it is not the truth. People worship ideas. Think they know the truth.</li>
<li>Parampara - passing on of ideas. And you become sorrowful and insecure. Or did you become a joyous person after ideation?</li>
<li>Soon brahmachari will be <strong>burdened by knowledge.</strong></li>
<li>Being a knowledgable person, standing on a high pedestal, he&rsquo;s got an agenda for the whole society, whole world. He looks down upon the people. He doesn&rsquo;t have any love for the people.</li>
<li><strong>When you learn the truth it doesn&rsquo;t accumulate</strong>.</li>
<li>In atmabodha there is no accumulation, only learning. In tattvabodha there is only accumulation, no learning. People want the burden of accumulation, not the joy of learning.</li>
<li>Buddha loves the people. He doesn&rsquo;t take part in the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.</li>
<li>Be cautious that it is learning, not accumulation. Buddha was ruthless, he said that metaphysical mumbo-jumbo is not for me.</li>
<li>Another meaning for &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; is &ldquo;people&rdquo;. The individual, not a person.</li>
<li>Your body is in the world. But <strong>the world is not outside of your mind. It is outside of your body.</strong></li>
<li>Mind produces thoughts. Consciousness is the entire movement of the mind. All experience of life is in the mind. Mind is frequency.</li>
<li>You experience the pain in the body but it stems from the mind. Immunity to corona virus is in the mind.</li>
<li>Manahpurvahgamah = individual - the one who moves along the mind. You go wherever mind takes you. You&rsquo;re what your mind is.</li>
<li>In this conglomerate of the body and mind, what is the supreme? Mind is the supreme.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLdBvIWVG3E">src</a></p>
<ul>
<li>People find it easy to believe, difficult to think. Easy to follow, difficult to define their own way.</li>
<li>Buddha has so much love for the people that he understands.</li>
<li><strong>We become very skillful with transcendental speculation.</strong></li>
<li>Buddha pulls the metaphysical Brahma into the empirical Dhamma. One and the same, they are not different. Shankara does the same. There is really no difference.</li>
<li>When you embrace a person you love, tell yourself it is mortal. This will prevent you from becoming an emotional entity.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t become an intellectual. You&rsquo;ll find it difficult to love people, because you&rsquo;ll be standing on a higher pedestal. Relationships also will become very soar.</strong></li>
<li>Your body must not be the body, the emotions, the intellect but the truth. The home in which you live is called sharanam. Buddha calls it Dhamma.</li>
<li>Shankara never refutes Buddha, he refutes buddhism only.</li>
<li><strong>The mind (another name is &ldquo;psychology) is an integral part of the nature. It is not separate.</strong> It is not that you&rsquo;re a person and have your own mind. Human consciousness, the movement of the mind, is the same. <strong>Also the same for physiology. Your body is part of nature.</strong> The person is throwing mud at you. You do not feel bad about the person. Mind creates things, e.g. conflict. And then believes the conflict is real.</li>
<li>The very idea of &ldquo;else&rdquo;, of &ldquo;other&rdquo; is a calamity. The mind creates a lot of mischief.</li>
<li>Thought -&gt; speech -&gt; action.</li>
<li>Religious leader gives you a list why there is suffering in the world. Every point is a miss.</li>
<li>There is no end to the monstrosity of ignorance. You don&rsquo;t need to educate people. At least don&rsquo;t push them into ignorance. Buddha: look at your mind. That is the culprit.</li>
<li>7 Sins: salt, sugar, stress, sleeplessness, sepsis, spirit + one more.</li>
<li>Desire is an impurity. <strong>Do not entertain any desire about anything on which you do not have any command.</strong> Remind yourself that all things are unreal and all people are mortal.</li>
<li>Marah here is used as synonym for kama (desire).</li>
<li><strong>All fears arise out of desire only.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prasadah is not eating food. Prasadah is a mind with clarity and cheerfullness.</strong></li>
<li>People are anxious about healing the body. You have to heal the mind (first). When you heal the mind you seldom become sick.</li>
<li><strong>When there is a desire lingering you&rsquo;re tense.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gossip is a direct outcome of jealousy.</strong></li>
<li>Vivekananda: <strong>desirelessness and fearlessness is godliness.The consciousness has become one with the godliness. It is already godliness. Hence you do not remember god separate of you.</strong></li>
<li>Upanishads: the moment the person becomes desireless that become he becomes immortal and that moment he becomes one with brahma.</li>
