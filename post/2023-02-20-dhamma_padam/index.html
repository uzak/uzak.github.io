<ul>
<li>Buddha was a upanishadah.</li>
<li>Buddha&rsquo;s fear: people will go after speculative religious practices by giving up the search for the truth.</li>
<li>Swami Vivekananda: Buddha was a great vedantist. Shankara was a hidden buddhist. Swami TV: Buddha is an open buddhist.</li>
<li><strong>Buddha dismissed cast and gender distinctions. All are human being. That was most unpalatable for the orthodox ritualists</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>When you hate something, you invent (folklore) stories</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Human society wants a villain. Unless there is a villain there is no target they can put all their vehemence against.</strong></li>
<li>The orthodox made Buddha a villain because he didn&rsquo;t agree with the violence (against the animals) of the karmakhanda. And then they made stories.</li>
<li>Prakrta is the language of the people. Sanskrta is the language of the elite.</li>
<li>Shankara wrote his bhasyas in the language of the people, which was at his time Sansrkt. Pali was the prakrta in the time of Buddha.</li>
<li>Buddha is different from Bauddhas. Bauddhas have understood Buddha in their own way. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything clearly about the transcendental. Buddhism is different from Buddha&rsquo;s teachings.</li>
<li>Dhamma Pada is a book of life.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ was not a religionist. He did not create a religion. He was a philosopher and advaita vedantin.</li>
<li>Indian Society is not a law abiding civilization, but a dharma abiding civilization. Europe and US is a law abiding civilization.</li>
<li>Vivekananda: <strong>Study Gita-Krishna, don&rsquo;t bother about Radha-Krishna</strong> (Krishna from stories).</li>
<li><strong>Life is relationships</strong>. Even for sanyasis, there is always a relationship - my students, my teacher, my vedanta, my class, my sampradaya &hellip;</li>
<li><strong>The value of the thing is not intrinsic. It comes from the mind. Because the mind believes it&rsquo;s valuable.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When physical things become very important in your live, you&rsquo;ll miss the truth and relationships with other people will get disturbed.</strong> Therefore the mind has more importance as the physical things. And one meaning of dharma is &ldquo;physical thing&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnZYdd_42rU">src</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is is real (sat) and your understanding of the real is the truth (satyam). Om is the sound represents the truth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We should devote the life to the search for the truth. Alternative is devoting it to artha, kama, dharma and there will be no truth in life. And without the search for the truth of life it will become a wasted life</strong>.</li>
<li>How not to waste a lot of life? Not by practising a lot more of religion.</li>
<li>How to begin the search for the truth? With the word &ldquo;OM&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s intonational sound, thus universal. Not alphabetical which is for human beings only.</li>
<li><strong>First learn to listen! Listen to what? Whatever is there.</strong> Don&rsquo;t judge the sound. Don&rsquo;t name. Don&rsquo;t approve. Don&rsquo;t like. Don&rsquo;t dislike. If you can it means your mind is silent.</li>
<li>Rshis were listening to the sounds of nature. And they discovered the sound OM.</li>
<li>All the sects revere the sound OM equally. Even buddhism. What comes after OM, they all differ. OM is the expression of truth. It is universal, doesn&rsquo;t belong to a particular language. It is the sound of nature.</li>
<li>I suggest ignore two things: rupa, nama.</li>
<li><strong>In this world there is nothing auspicious. Everything is a trap, takes away the freedom, binds you. Yet there is opposite of it, the real, which is also called Shiva. It makes you joyous. Where is it? Everywhere. How to represent it - Vishnuh. It&rsquo;s not a person.</strong> How to represent it - &ldquo;that&rdquo;, out of which the 4th case is &ldquo;tasmai&rdquo;. That is how do it the Upanishads.</li>
<li><strong>Gurudom - people are waiting for the truth to be told. This has come from the ritualism. You put the proper dress on, sit and wait to be told.</strong> The same spirit bring the sishyas to the Vedanta class. In learning you discuss together, inquire together and with open mind you examine and explore.</li>
<li>(Vedantic) meditation means reflection, contemplation.</li>
<li>sa:Arahan = most deserving.</li>
<li>There are two jobs in Indian society for which you need no qualification what-so-ever. Politics and gurudom.</li>
<li>Acharya is the one who walks the talk.</li>
<li>Swami Vivekanda: <strong>Buddha may or may not believed in personal god. That does not matter to me. He reached the same state of perfection to which others come by bhakti, yoga or jnana.</strong> They lead to state of perfection and Buddha has reached this state. Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor cast, nor priest, nor custom. He fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him. Such a <strong>fearless search for truth, that is Buddha.</strong> Such love for any living thing, the world has never seen.</li>
<li>Buddha himself believes in some sort of eternal being. It can be seen from his utterances. He doesn&rsquo;t give the name &ldquo;Brahma&rdquo; to it. His name is &ldquo;Damma&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There is no knowing in the future. By putting it in the future, you&rsquo;ve blocked any possibility of knowing the truth. There cannot be any understanding in the psychological future. But <strong>we say we&rsquo;ll understand and we&rsquo;re sure the guru understands. This is called fanaticism.</strong> You don&rsquo;t know but are so sure the guru knows. What you&rsquo;re getting is a bunch of ideas - ideation.</li>
<li><strong>The idea is not the thing, the word is not the thing.</strong> Knowing the word &ldquo;jackfruit&rdquo; nor having an idea about it is not the truth. People worship ideas. Think they know the truth.</li>
<li>Parampara - passing on of ideas. And you become sorrowful and insecure. Or did you become a joyous person after ideation?</li>
<li>Soon brahmachari will be <strong>burdened by knowledge.</strong></li>
<li>Being a knowledgable person, standing on a high pedestal, he&rsquo;s got an agenda for the whole society, whole world. He looks down upon the people. He doesn&rsquo;t have any love for the people.</li>
<li><strong>When you learn the truth it doesn&rsquo;t accumulate</strong>.</li>
<li>In atmabodha there is no accumulation, only learning. In tattvabodha there is only accumulation, no learning. People want the burden of accumulation, not the joy of learning.</li>
<li>Buddha loves the people. He doesn&rsquo;t take part in the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.</li>
<li>Be cautious that it is learning, not accumulation. Buddha was ruthless, he said that metaphysical mumbo-jumbo is not for me.</li>
<li>Another meaning for &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; is &ldquo;people&rdquo;. The individual, not a person.</li>
<li>Your body is in the world. But <strong>the world is not outside of your mind. It is outside of your body.</strong></li>
<li>Mind produces thoughts. Consciousness is the entire movement of the mind. All experience of life is in the mind. Mind is frequency.</li>
<li>You experience the pain in the body but it stems from the mind. Immunity to corona virus is in the mind.</li>
<li>Manahpurvahgamah = individual - the one who moves along the mind. You go wherever mind takes you. You&rsquo;re what your mind is.</li>
<li>In this conglomerate of the body and mind, what is the supreme? Mind is the supreme.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLdBvIWVG3E">src</a></p>
<ul>
<li>People find it easy to believe, difficult to think. Easy to follow, difficult to define their own way.</li>
<li>Buddha has so much love for the people that he understands.</li>
<li><strong>We become very skillful with transcendental speculation.</strong></li>
<li>Buddha pulls the metaphysical Brahma into the empirical Dhamma. One and the same, they are not different. Shankara does the same. There is really no difference.</li>
<li>When you embrace a person you love, tell yourself it is mortal. This will prevent you from becoming an emotional entity.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t become an intellectual. You&rsquo;ll find it difficult to love people, because you&rsquo;ll be standing on a higher pedestal. Relationships also will become very soar.</strong></li>
<li>Your body must not be the body, the emotions, the intellect but the truth. The home in which you live is called sharanam. Buddha calls it Dhamma.</li>
<li>Shankara never refutes Buddha, he refutes buddhism only.</li>
<li><strong>The mind (another name is &ldquo;psychology) is an integral part of the nature. It is not separate.</strong> It is not that you&rsquo;re a person and have your own mind. Human consciousness, the movement of the mind, is the same. <strong>Also the same for physiology. Your body is part of nature.</strong> The person is throwing mud at you. You do not feel bad about the person. Mind creates things, e.g. conflict. And then believes the conflict is real.</li>
<li>The very idea of &ldquo;else&rdquo;, of &ldquo;other&rdquo; is a calamity. The mind creates a lot of mischief.</li>
<li>Thought -&gt; speech -&gt; action.</li>
<li>Religious leader gives you a list why there is suffering in the world. Every point is a miss.</li>
<li>There is no end to the monstrosity of ignorance. You don&rsquo;t need to educate people. At least don&rsquo;t push them into ignorance. Buddha: look at your mind. That is the culprit.</li>
<li>7 Sins: salt, sugar, stress, sleeplessness, sepsis, spirit + one more.</li>
<li>Desire is an impurity. <strong>Do not entertain any desire about anything on which you do not have any command.</strong> Remind yourself that all things are unreal and all people are mortal.</li>
<li>Marah here is used as synonym for kama (desire).</li>
<li><strong>All fears arise out of desire only.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prasadah is not eating food. Prasadah is a mind with clarity and cheerfullness.</strong></li>
<li>People are anxious about healing the body. You have to heal the mind (first). When you heal the mind you seldom become sick.</li>
<li><strong>When there is a desire lingering you&rsquo;re tense.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gossip is a direct outcome of jealousy.</strong></li>
<li>Vivekananda: <strong>desirelessness and fearlessness is godliness. The consciousness has become one with the godliness. It is already godliness. Hence you do not remember god separate of you.</strong></li>
<li>Upanishads: the moment the person becomes desireless that moment he becomes immortal and that moment he becomes one with brahma.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-yPiMW_PXk">src</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to the sounds, far as well as near, without naming. You&rsquo;re now establish in what is called sakshi bhavah. You&rsquo;re not a person anymore.</li>
<li><strong>First sanyasin was actually Buddha.</strong></li>
<li>Buddha declined to define the nature of the absolute reality. He contented himself with negative description. So do upanishads.</li>
<li>When superstition comes from great acharyas you have to call it sophistry. <strong>It is difficult to draw a line between the superstition of the ignorant people and sophistry of the learned.</strong></li>
<li>Traditional - whatever doesn&rsquo;t fall within the narrow vision is labeled as non-traditional and non-worthwhile. That&rsquo;s sophistry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the right person to speak about it, sit down&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You have to find a light in yourselves. You cannot rely entirely upon a physical entity called guru. But ultimately you&rsquo;re your own guide.</li>
<li>Religious way of life is not where rituals but wisdom dominates. Superstition is loaded with fear.</li>
<li>Prasada - clarity in thinking, charity in feeling in mind and in action.</li>
<li>When you play the same tune you stop thinking about it. Without thinking you develop an attachment to it.</li>
<li>You get a feeling that you&rsquo;re familiar with it even without knowing it. There is so much knowledge but no learning. Knowledge accumulate, learning does not.</li>
<li>Knowledge is professional. Learning is loaded with love.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re caught in a structure you won&rsquo;t be able to listen to anything new, thinking in an original way. You know only to move in a groove.</li>
<li>Art of listening. Give full attention. Listen with entire operation of the thought, which is but memory, at bay. That is how you have to listen to the scriptures. Keep all the knowledge you&rsquo;ve accumulated on Vedanta aside.</li>
<li><strong>Thinking and stress go together. Stress has its origin in thought.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When you listen with full attention, you&rsquo;re fully relaxed. In the very act of listening, the old tape gets wiped out.</strong></li>
<li>You have to find a way of living, which is not dependent on any belief. Where a very creative thinking guides the life.</li>
<li>Prasadah: the circumstances around do not impact you. The quality of life is always free, young (not biologically), vital&hellip;</li>
<li>The old ways of thinking, the repetition of old patterns and repetition of living and acting come to an end when you pay attention.</li>
<li>Are you serious about finding a way of live where there is no misery, no turmoil? Than you have to get rid of the old habit of thought. E.g. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m somebody&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Through the old habit of thought we get caught in the samsara. I&rsquo;m somebody, I&rsquo;m such and such and I want to fulfill myself. Why?</strong> That is selfishness. Why should you fulfill yourself or become something? You&rsquo;d know what you&rsquo;re. You need not become anything other than you&rsquo;re.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I believe in my opinions&rdquo;. They are not your opinions! Somebody has put them there.</strong></li>
<li>There is so much fragmentation. All fragmentation leads to confusion.</li>
<li>Find for yourself what is the right way of thinking and living. <strong>You&rsquo;ve to find that wisdom in yourself by yourself.</strong></li>
<li>In the inner movement only creative thinking and learning (which is in the present), not memory, helps.</li>
<li><strong>Religions promise to heal the mind. They won&rsquo;t do it. You have to take your life in your hands.</strong></li>
<li>Child-Like mind not childish mind.</li>
<li>Buddha&rsquo;s <strong>loving kindness meditation</strong>: to get rid of injustice towards me and hate.</li>
<li>Nobody can hurt you. Only your actions, your thoughts, the way you conduct your relationships. Unless you allow the other person to hurt you, nobody can hurt you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="05">05</h2>

<ul>
<li>All people are frustrated. With their places, jobs, relationships, marriages, family life to sanyasa &hellip; hoping to find something better. Bhagavan Buddha is acting out this frustration.</li>
<li><strong>Science and technology doesn&rsquo;t divide people. It unites them. Indian aeroplane can be flown by a German guy. Whereas religion, belief system, divides people.</strong> You feel animosity spontaneously to an unknown person for the simple reason that he is not your co-religionist.</li>
<li><strong>Ideology is nothing but an idea highlighted and blown-up to very big proportions as if it is the truth. Ideologs are not peaceful, but very frustrated, agitated and unhappy people.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fulfillment and frustration are interrelated. Fulfillment of what?</strong> Goal, desire of the mind.</li>
<li>Frustration is but a form of hate only.</li>
<li>Jealousy is nothing but hatred.</li>
<li><strong>Sensation is another name for thought. You&rsquo;ve got a pleasant sensation, fulfilment - that&rsquo;s thought. Thought is not love. Love is the flame and thought is the smoke.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Love has no opposite. There will be always an opposite for thought.</strong></li>
<li>Love is like water. It is not limited by a given vessel. When you think of it, do you think of a particular vessel? Is it meant to be partaken by a given person?</li>
<li>When you know love you&rsquo;ve known god. What people usually have is attachment.</li>
<li>Heart is burdened by the things of the head.</li>
<li><strong>You cannot find a rich man happy. He&rsquo;s a slave to his riches.</strong> He&rsquo;s an unhappy person. There is sorrow in him, even though he might not give expression to it.</li>
<li>Buddha is sensitive to sorrow in all.</li>
<li>Preamble of the constitution of <strong>UNESCO: since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.</strong></li>
<li>Swami TV: there is every reason to be frustrated. But I&rsquo;m not frustrated. I&rsquo;m ecstatic? No. I&rsquo;m a simple person living my life. Yet I don&rsquo;t feel any hate. It&rsquo;s just a matter of paying attention.</li>
<li>Sometimes in a given context it&rsquo;s inappropriate not to be frustrated.</li>
<li>sa:sham-a (to douse, to extinguish) becomes sa:shantih.</li>
<li>Examine your thought process. As long as it (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m somebody&rdquo;, &ldquo;I deserve&rdquo;, &hellip;) is retained in your consciousness, the fire of enmity won&rsquo;t be extinguished.</li>
<li>To heal psychologically is more important that to heal physically. Get out of that thought pattern (&ldquo;that somebody has wronged me&rdquo;). You get what you deserve, call it destiny if you want. Stop thinking on that lines.</li>
<li><strong>Vipashyana meditation. Just watch the breath. Buddha&rsquo;s scheme: meditate 30 days long at a given time. Do it alone.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Who&rsquo;s right, who&rsquo;s wrong. That&rsquo;s not the point.</strong></li>
<li>Loving kindness meditation. Practice, once/twice times a week. And then look at your consciousness. The antagonism comes to an end. It is one of the great blessings of bhagavan Buddha.</li>
<li>Be in dark. Sitting upright is important. At least in the beginning. It takes out the tamoguna. The laziness.</li>
<li><strong>Alertness and relaxation go together.</strong> They are complimentary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMBtIFDvic4">src</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Law is man-made, dharma is the outcome of the nature which is God.</strong> For us God is not different from nature. What you call nature has God as its substratum.</li>
<li><strong>Sanatanah means timeless, whereas law is time-bound. Laws also change from space to space. Sometimes even from person to person.</strong> Laws are very changeable.</li>
<li>Even dharma can change but it&rsquo;s scope is universal. Dharma has its origin in the nature. Dharma is the laws that govern the cosmos. Like you don&rsquo;t want to hurt any other creature because you yourself don&rsquo;t want to be hurt. Ahimsa is dharma, not a law enacted by a king or a ruler.</li>
<li>Sanatanah can mean perennial (like the sun, which will be exhausted) and timeless like the atma.</li>
<li>Being. I&rsquo;m. It is the same irrespective of time. Morning, evening, midnight, the I&rsquo;m-ness is the same. Mind is not the same. At office, at home mind is different. I&rsquo;m is not different.</li>
<li>It is a crazy world in which no guru encourages the student to find the God for himself.</li>
<li>Upanishadic method: based on the hints you discover what is the God. <strong>In Upanishad the preceptor encourages the student to find the truth.</strong></li>
<li>What is the truth? Whatever is!</li>
<li><strong>The thing in it-self. Gold is the thing, not ornament.</strong></li>
<li>Essence of all the upanishadic upasanas. Look at living (chit) and non-living (jada). That you have around you. Prakuruti. The substratum of this is Ishvara or Brahma. All upanishadic upasanas are based on this principle. Brahma is before as as the intelligence that commands and controls the universe. Sattvaguna. That is hiranyagarbhopasana.</li>
<li>Even when you&rsquo;re looking at the world you&rsquo;re looking at God. This is the upasana.</li>
<li>The present day Hindu-Society has moved out of three main pillars of any cultural religion: 1) grantha - the scripture 2) acaryah 3) commitment of the devotees.</li>
<li>Everybody follow what scriptures he likes.</li>
<li>Instead of acarayah there are preachers. When there are followers a leader will come up. There is no unified vision.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological health is far more important than physical.</strong> Mind and body influence each other.</li>
<li>When the age comes and the psychological health is not in good shape, you&rsquo;ll suffer to no end.</li>
<li>We concentrate mostly on healing the outward. That is how the popular opinion is. That&rsquo;s why a physician draws large groups of patients.</li>
<li>Idealogical people are not peaceful people. They don&rsquo;t know what is peace. They are very agitated people. They have enemies. Mahatmas don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Kaliyuga pill-yuga.</li>
<li><strong>Dharma - clarity in thinking (utterly uncorrupted), charity in thinking, purity action.</strong></li>
<li>Conflict you have in your heart dissipates the vital energy which you so desperately need to know the truth.</li>
<li>If there is a conflict. You should not do anything. That is likely to make the conflict worse. Your goal must be to take out the conflict, the hate from the consciousness. If there is a reason, if you feel injustice done to you, go and offer him some flowers or wish him well. Go and help him to come out of his difficulties. Break the cycle of difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>Replace hostility with love or at least neutralize it.</strong></li>
<li>The one who is ridiculing or insulting is indeed insulting himself.</li>
<li>Your mind will tell you the other is your enemy. He&rsquo;s wronged you. You have to teach him a lesson. It is a battle against yourself. Dhammapada says: nahI vayrena vayrani shamyanti. This is the <strong>devAsura samgramah - battle between gods and deamons. God tells you &ldquo;bless your enemy&rdquo;. Inside there is a jiva, separate from god. That person tells you &ldquo;this is the time to strike and take revenge&rdquo;.</strong> You have to decide.</li>
