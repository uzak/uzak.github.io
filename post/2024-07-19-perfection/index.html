It&rsquo;s boredom!</p><p>Imagine working hard your entire life for perfection. You improve, then push even harder and improve more. Finally, you become the best. There you areâ€”perfect. You know all the rules of the game, and all the tricks, too. Each game is fixed; you know the winner in advance - it&rsquo;s you! The first game, the next, and even the last, you know the results beforehand. And you start to yawn. Yes, it&rsquo;s become so boring.</p><p>Therefore, what follows perfection is boredom. But first, let&rsquo;s see how we got here. Remember when you were so small that you can&rsquo;t even recall those times? Of course, you don&rsquo;t, but that was when your environment, perhaps your closest ones, made you feel that you weren&rsquo;t good enough. Love seemed absent. So, you ventured out into the world to earn it. Logically, if you were perfect, you would deserve love! Well, now you&rsquo;ve reached perfection and still haven&rsquo;t earned the love you sought. Now, what you have is perfection and boredom. Actually, they are synonyms. The feeling of emptiness remains, but there is nothing more you can do. You&rsquo;re perfect. There is nothing more to achieve; you&rsquo;ve done it all. Being perfect and bored, what do you want now?</p><p>You want the unknown - not to know in advance. The opposite of what you&rsquo;re after until now. Sounds like an adventure, a mystery. Does it? You want to experience the opposite of what you already are! Another word what you want is &ldquo;life&rdquo;. And yet another is &ldquo;love&rdquo;. Love of the unknown. In the beginning, you didn&rsquo;t understand this, but now you do. Life is your show. And you love it. Enjoy! (This) knowledge is the victory, the logical the result of achieving perfection.</p><p>Wait, but we&rsquo;re all living imperfect lives. Could mean that all is good as it is? That they are all based on perfection, which we already are?</p><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
