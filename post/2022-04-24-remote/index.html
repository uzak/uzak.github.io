    <h2 id="the-time-is-right-for-remote-work">The Time Is Right for Remote Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Office during the day has become the last place where people get their work done.</li>
<li>Required: ability to be alone with your thoughts.</li>
<li>Stop commuting your life away - commutes make you fat, stressed and miserable.</li>
<li>Escaping 9am-5pm: synchronous -&gt; asynchronous</li>
<li>End of city monopoly
<ul>
<li>Industrialism (factories): gather a large number of people into small area.</li>
<li>life need not be divided into arbitrary phases: work and retirement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talent isn&rsquo;t bound by the hubs
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about the money - promote quality of life, getting best people available</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-excuses">Dealing with Excuses</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re struggling with trust issues, you&rsquo;ve made a poor hiring decision. We have no desire to be babysitters during the day.</li>
<li>Most people want to work as long as it&rsquo;s stimulating and fulfilling. If you&rsquo;re stuck in a dead-end job that has no prospects of being either, then you don&rsquo;t need just a remote position, you need a new job.</li>
<li>Forcing everyone into the office every day is an organizational SPoF.</li>
<li>Reptilian resistance is not rational but deeply emotional. Fight or flight.</li>
<li>Good for hours of overlap to avoid collaboration delays and feel like a team.</li>
<li>Seeing is believing: Record a screencast (animated gif, youtube etc.) and narrate the experience.</li>
<li>Meetings and managers - are actually the greatest causes of work not getting done at the office.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="big-business">Big business</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many big businesses get away with staggering amounts of inefficiency and bureaucracy and seem fine for years. What you need is confidence that you see a smarter way.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re in the game to find the best way to work. The most productive and happiness-inducting setup wins.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>The stronger the culture the less explicit training and supervision is needed.</li>
<li>Best cultures derive from actions people actually take, not the ones they write in the mission statements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-need-an-answer-now">I need an answer now</h3>
<ul>
<li>too many interruptions - little gets done.</li>
<li>There is nothing more arrogant than taking up someone else&rsquo;s time with a question you don&rsquo;t need an answer right now. Email -&gt; IM -&gt; telephone.</li>
<li>ASAP-free. Use that calm to be even more productive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forward-motion">Forward motion</h3>
<ul>
<li>weekly discussion thread with the subject &ldquo;What have you been working on?&rdquo; Everyone contributes a few lines about past week and what&rsquo;s intended for the next week. It&rsquo;s not a precise, rigorous estimation process. It doesn&rsquo;t attempt to deal with coordination. It simply aims to make everyone feel like they&rsquo;re in the same galley and not their own little rowboat.</li>
<li>Progress is a joy best shared with coworkers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-work-is-what-matters">The work is what matters</h3>
<ul>
<li>work itself is the best yardstick to judge someone&rsquo;s performance</li>
<li>s/what did you do today?/Show me what you did today/</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beware-of-dragons">Beware of Dragons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cabin fever is real. Remote work doesn&rsquo;t mean being chained to your home-office desk.</li>
<li>Solid writing and language skills are required.</li>
<li>Lessons from open source: triumph of asynchronous collaboration and communication</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ergonomics-basics">Ergonomics Basics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proper desk, proper chain, proper screen.</li>
<li>Adopt a healthy lifestyle.</li>
<li>Give remote work a real chance or don’t bother at all. It’s okay to start small, but make sure it’s meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-with-clients">Working with clients</h3>
<ul>
<li>First, when pitching business, let the prospective client know up front that you don&rsquo;t live where they live.</li>
<li>Second, provide references before the client even asks.</li>
<li>Third, show them work often.</li>
<li>Fourth, be very available.</li>
<li>Lastly, get the client involved and let them follow along. Make sure they feel this is their project too. So their anxieties and fears will be replaced by excitement and anticipation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="live-moves-on">Live moves on</h3>
<ul>
<li>most companies have fixation on keeping their workers.</li>
<li>Keeping a solid team together for a long time is a key to peak performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keep-the-good-times-going">Keep the good times going</h3>
<ul>
<li>when the bulk of your communication happens via email and the like, it doesn&rsquo;t take much for bad blood to develop unless everyone is making their best effort to the contrary.</li>
<li>Sentiments are infectious, good or bad.</li>
<li>No assholes allowed, no drama allowed, no bad vibes allowed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-thriving--equal-work-equal-pay">The cost of thriving / equal work equal pay</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your entire workforce is located in a hot hub and you pay market salaries, you’ll be under constant attack from poachers</li>
<li>almost unfair advantage in attracting and keeping the best people in the world. So don’t look at remote work as a way to skimp on salaries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="great-remote-workers-are-simply-great-workers">Great remote workers are simply great workers</h3>
<ul>
<li>two key qualities: smart and GTD</li>
<li>Beware of mental shortcut: nice person = good workers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-writing-well">On writing well</h3>
<ul>
<li>first filter that really matters is the cover letter explaining why is there a fit between the company and the applicant. Sometimes you&rsquo;ve less than 10 seconds.</li>
<li>First clarity, second style.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-project">Test project</h3>
<ul>
<li>never ask people to work for free. Make it meaningful too.</li>
<li>narrow the field to two or three candidates and meet them in person.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="managing-remote-workers">Managing remote workers</h2>
<ul>
<li>a great place to start is to allow your current employees to begin working remotely.</li>
<li>one on ones: check with remote workers more frequently. Ideally every month.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stop-managing-the-chairs">Stop managing the chairs.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The job of a manager is not to herd cats, but to lead and verify work.</li>
<li>When or where someone is doing the work is irrelevant most of the time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="remove-the-roadblocks-entirely">Remove the roadblocks entirely</h3>
<ul>
<li>start by empowering everyone to make decisions on their own.</li>
<li>everyone gets a company credit card and is told to &ldquo;spend wisely&rdquo;.</li>
<li>no need to ask for permission to go on vacation. Just put in in the calendar and coordinate with coworkers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="be-on-the-lookout-for-overwork-not-underwork">Be on the lookout for overwork, not underwork</h3>
<ul>
<li>if work is all-consuming, the worker is far more likely to burn out.</li>
<li>from May to October, we give everyone an additional weekday.</li>
<li>sponsor employee&rsquo;s hobbies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="life-as-a-remote-worker">Life as a remote worker</h2>
<ul>
<li>Morning remote, afternoon local</li>
<li>Family time is a good way to counterbalance the loss of daily in-person contact with coworkers.</li>
<li>home office -&gt; coffee shop -&gt; single desk -&gt; plain vanilla single suite.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-a-routine">Building a routine</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>separate the clothes you wear depending whether you&rsquo;re in work/play mode</strong></li>
<li><strong>divide the day into chunks like: catch-up, collaboration and serious work</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>dedicated home office</strong>. No checking work email or just getting a little more done in the living room or your bedroom</li>
<li><strong>One computer for work and another for fun</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Separate accounts for work and fun</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="staying-motivated">Staying motivated</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>motivation is the fuel of intellectual work</strong></li>
<li><strong>trying to motivate by means of rewards or threats is terribly ineffective</strong></li>
<li><strong>the only reliable way to muster motivation is to encourage people to work on things they like and care about, with people they like and care about.</strong> There are no shortcuts.</li>
<li>Routine has a tendency to numb your creativity.</li>
