<ul>
<li>The self is as it is not as it is imagined. The self remains veiled by the vasanas. And it reveals itself when there are no vasanas. That is called self-realization that leads to moksha.</li>
<li>Desirelessness is godliness.</li>
<li>A brashtah is one who doesn&rsquo;t stay on the course. The loss is not total. Whatever ground you&rsquo;ve gained, you&rsquo;ll not lose it. All worldly accomplishments (wealth, power, knowledge) will be lost. None of it transfers to the next birth.</li>
<li>Yogabrastah - one who pursues desires and yoga together. He&rsquo;ll go to heaven.</li>
<li><strong>For a sincere seeker going to heaven would be a punishment. Same for a birth to a rich family. So a sincere seeker takes birth in a family of a seekers of truth. Not very well to do people. He&rsquo;ll have the enormous advantage of satsang without doing any effort. He won&rsquo;t have the enormous obstacles of heaven and riches.</strong></li>
<li>Gita praises birth in a poor family.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence - the critical thinking, love for truth (yoga - self-knowledge), is sva.</strong> That is called here buddhi. That you&rsquo;ll never lose and that transfers to the other life. Everything else is para (the other): wealth, accomplishments &hellip; all you&rsquo;ll lose with death of the body.</li>
<li>For truth, you need intelligence, not intellect. <strong>Intelligence is the capacity to think freely. Without fear, without a formula.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Any form of ambition is worldly. It breads anxiety and fear.</strong> Ambition, greed do not help to bring about a mind that is clear, direct, simple and intelligent.</li>
<li>In one part of life the reading books, intellect, knowledge is required. In another part of life where you pursue the truth all of that is not going to help.</li>
<li>When you prepare a formula, or formulate the pursuit of self-knowledge, it takes you towards knowledge, but not intelligence. Intelligence is very subtle, knowledge very gross.</li>
<li>Wisdom, <strong>self-knowledge comes into its own, when you understand the total process of your mind.</strong> That is intelligence. How it is creating jealousy, greed etc. That doesn&rsquo;t come from studying books. To get that wisdom, you need not study a single book.</li>
<li><strong>Your mind is the result of entire community, family, sometimes entire country.</strong></li>
<li>Intelligence arises when there is no fear. If you&rsquo;re afraid of God, devil who will punish. If you&rsquo;re afraid of losing money, near and dear. When all that fear is ruling your life, you cannot become intelligent.</li>
<li><strong>The movement of fear is the movement of selfishness. Love is the movement of selflessness.</strong></li>
<li>There is no brastha in yoga.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvq1ocvtjztoa"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oCvTjZtOA">Class 2</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is a punishment, it prevents intelligence.</strong></li>
<li>When the mind becomes quiet, the intelligence comes to the fore.</li>
<li>What is the purpose of study? Am I embellishing the braincells or am I enriching my intelligence?</li>
<li>In work intelligence means karma yoga. In quarrel there is intelligence - you bless the adversary, understand that it is all very temporal and unreal.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re able to love all - that is beauty. There is intelligence in beauty.</li>
<li>There is no truth in beliefs. <strong>There is intelligence in every aspect of life.</strong></li>
<li>Instead of pursuing the truth the people pursue a system.</li>
<li><strong>Brain is as mechanical as a machine. What you call knowledge is mechanical and accumulated - data.</strong> Whether it is in a GPS or in in the braincell (intellect).</li>
<li>If you bring these vasanas to Vedanta it fails to deliver. <strong>Vedanta is not so much intellect as intelligence.</strong></li>
<li>What is the operation of intelligence? An intelligent mind is constantly learning. You learn from a child, plant, animal, donkey&hellip; It is an inquiring mind. Intelligence is not something you can acquire (para) and will lose, it is in you (sva). <strong>When the mind is quiet, intelligence shines. Intelligence is hibernating in you, you wake it up.</strong></li>
<li>Generally in the presence of the mahatma the vasanas are resolved. When you go into the world and pursue worldly companies the vasanas wake up. And once they are active the jnana remains covered up - that&rsquo;s the game that&rsquo;s going on.</li>
<li>As he pursues the truth, as the intelligence is playing out, he knows his real being, his fullness. He&rsquo;s not the body, he&rsquo;s not born in this world, nor he&rsquo;s going to die in this world. In fact the world springs from his consciousness and when he goes to sleep the world resolves in him. That&rsquo;s the intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>The essence of ignorance - you feel you were born at a certain place, to a set of parents and you&rsquo;ll die.</strong> And this you keep and nobody should disturb that. <strong>How do you know? Because you experience? All of that is hear-say. Please meet me when you have first hand information! You live by hearsay and memory.</strong></li>
<li>Action and actionless is not hostile to each other. They are together. That is intelligence. Natural thing happens naturally (what needs to be done gets done) yet you remain the actionlessness in yourself.</li>
<li><strong>The effort is in prakuruti (body/mind), there is no effort in yourself. This is samsiddhi.</strong> That&rsquo;s the peace, that&rsquo;s the bliss. A liberated person&rsquo;s mind moves and still remains at peace.</li>
<li>Samsaris who do not see clearly have thousands of questions and they will never be answered clearly. <strong>For a jnani no questions are left.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Heaven is a place of wealth and pleasures. There you&rsquo;re not in your control anymore. You become overwhelmed. Therefore the question of pursuing self-knowledge doesn&rsquo;t arise in heaven.</strong></li>
<li>Students of Vedanta performing kamyakarmas is an enormous contradiction.</li>
