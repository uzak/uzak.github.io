<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding is action only. Follow-by actions means effort only.</strong> You understand and act, that simple it is. That is how understanding operates.</li>
<li>You know the movement of your mind. Mind is the object. <strong>Don&rsquo;t make it a subject. If you make the mind subject: one part of the mind knows the other part of the mind. But then who knows that one part is known by the other?</strong> The witness, the true self.</li>
<li>Doing is vikara, seeing and knowing is not vikara.</li>
<li>Avatara is a concept started in 10th - 11th century.</li>
<li>Word avatara doesn&rsquo;t exist in Shankara&rsquo;s Bhashya. Avatara means descent. Comes from the concept of an old guy sitting in heaven and fixing the world every now and then there is a major problem.</li>
<li>Rama and Krishna&rsquo;s were not gods at their time. They were human beings who allowed their godliness to manifest. They became only later worshiped as gods.</li>
<li>Vanara - humanoid tribe.</li>
<li>Uttara kanda - fabrication. Not part of the original Ramayana.</li>
<li>Ramayana is a story of love. Like Titanic.</li>
<li>Vaishnavism is a sectarian religious movement which started sometimes 10/11th century AD.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge is very essential for the outer life. Understanding which is not knowledge is very crucial for the inner life.</strong></li>
<li>Advice to youngsters: <strong>give importance to thinking, instead of believing. Questioning instead of following. What is life? You have to discover yourself.</strong> Question, study, discover and be wiser instead of believing, following etc.</li>
<li>Learn to pay attention. Attention deficiency is the problem of the tiktok-generation.</li>
<li><strong>In life there are no responsibilities, there are only duties.</strong> Responsibility implies that you control the outcome.</li>
<li>Ambition is poisonous bread. An ambition centers around me and mine. An ambitious person marries his ambition. Love has secondary position.</li>
<li>In spontaneity there is no how.</li>
