<h2 id="40httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvotplffyhppy---verse-10"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTplfFYhppY">40</a> - Verse 10</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 ways of spirituality: karma, bhakti, yoga, jnana. Temple provides facility for all of these. People do all four. Nothing happens, because the mind is compulsive - hyperactive. Karma becomes mechanical, jnana becomes ideation, bhakti becomes a show - you&rsquo;ll need outer symbols of love. Yoga - should be conscious, lose the eyes, be aware of every single movement the body is doing.</li>
<li>How to feel brahman? You feel full and happy for no reason. There is no sense of dissatisfaction whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>Pleasurability is in the excited form of mind. Happiness is in the form of shanti, quietude. That is the brahman.</strong></li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re the brahman, why can&rsquo;t you feel it? Because the mind is making too much noise. Like when there are too many clouds on a shiny day.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re unable to stop thinking. Thought has become compulsive. People suffer because of compulsive thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly it becomes very destructive.</strong></li>
<li>This is not kali-yuga. This is pill-yuga. Because people are anxious and don&rsquo;t have patience. Don&rsquo;t start with pills. Start with jogging or a trainer.</li>
<li><strong>Mind throws an opaque screen of labels and images on the vision</strong>, bhavana, love.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mind wants to bite into a problem. Like a dog needs a bone to bite into.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Most of the problems are imagined only. They are very subjective.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ego (me and mine) is located in the brain, not knee, belly etc. Feel it there. Therefore leave the head alone and begin with the heart. Abide there.</li>
<li><strong>sa:stha -&gt; en:stay</strong></li>
<li>Mind should identify with its source &ldquo;sva&rdquo; - atma. Not with the outer. So it develop the quietude and merges in its source and abides in the heart.</li>
<li>In karmayoga the mind totally gets absorbed in the work you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s called karmasamadhi. That&rsquo;s what you need, not karma per se.</li>
<li>In bhakti (sharanagati) the me, the mind, surrenders completely and there is communion with god in the heart. In bhakti you do not know why you love God.
<ul>
<li>One becomes unconscious of things. No mind. No mine.</li>
<li>No care even for one own&rsquo;s body. No me. You become indifferent (not careless).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Love with understanding is bhakti. Understanding with love is jnanam.</li>
<li>Whatever you think with the mind is not Ishvara. Mind resolved in the heart, that is Ishvara.</li>
<li>Bhakta, karma, yoga, jnanam are not four things. But an unified vision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="41httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcot9bb_uetq---verse-11"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coT9bB_UEtQ">41</a> - Verse 11</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once the mind becomes calm it resolves in the being.</li>
<li>You need a mechanism to calm down the mind. That mechanism is the prana. Because it&rsquo;s between the matter (gross) and the mind (subtle), it&rsquo;s an escape mechanism from the bondage.
<ul>
<li>hold the breath for 30-35 secs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parallel to buddhist vipassana.</li>
<li>Smile is the silent message of bhagavan Buddha. It is your birthright, it is love, it is freedom. Nobody can takeaway your smile.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="42httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvgofx8rvhpc---verse-12"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgofx8rVHpc">42</a> - Verse 12</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about God, it&rsquo;s about you. You&rsquo;ve got kriya shakti (the power of doing, vitalforce) and vijnanashakti (the power of knowing).</li>
<li>Power of doing is the prAnashakti. prAna has a synonym which is vAyu. Prana inside, vAyu outside.</li>
<li>Vijnanashakti, called also cit. Eyes seeing, ears hearing will not be enough&hellip; Mind must be there.</li>
<li>The two branches of shakti (kriya, vijnana) have the same basis - mUlam, which is the atma. Out of atma comes shakti. If atma is brahman, then the shakti is maya.</li>
<li>What is inside is outside and what is outside is inside.</li>
<li>In outside you have cosmic intelligence and the cosmic power. They have the same origin in brahman. The inside intelligence and power have the same origin in atma.</li>
<li><strong>For seeing the separation, you don&rsquo;t need shastra. If there is something common, then you need shastra. Shastra says the body mind is not important, the base is.</strong></li>
<li>Citta is different from person to person, from human to animals etc.</li>
<li>When you see it is mostly vijnanashakti. When you speak it is the combination of kriya and vijnana.</li>
<li>Shiva weds Parvati. Shiva is the atma, parmati is the twofold shakti.</li>
<li>Vishnu weds Lakshmi and Bhudevi. Vishnu is the Atma, Lakshmi is the kriyashakti, Bhudevi is the jnanashakti.</li>
<li>Observe the breathing process. It will take you to the very awareness itself. It is obvious, because prana/vayu has originated in the atma.</li>
<li>Or be aware of the thinking process. Recognize it. Don&rsquo;t contradict it. Don&rsquo;t deny it. Don&rsquo;t condemn it. Just be aware. The awareness of the chitta will take you to the source.</li>
<li><strong>Awareness is watching, observation without condemnation.</strong> Then you come to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Whatever you&rsquo;re aware of without judging, you&rsquo;ll come to understand.</strong></li>
<li>There is identification (positive thing), not condemnation (negative thing). Both are bad. Go for silent observation.</li>
<li>You disturb you don&rsquo;t watch. If you don&rsquo;t watch you don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
<li>The secrets of life one can understand by (silent) observation.</li>
<li>The personality is a myth. You&rsquo;re not a person. It is the negation of the self so the egoistic self comes to an end. Breath will continue, thinking process will continue, person will be gone.</li>
<li>Very rarely you come across a person without demands.</li>
<li>Entire religion is demands and petition to god.</li>
<li>The ego-self is there only when you&rsquo;re not alert, attentive, awarefull.</li>
<li><strong>Watch natural phenomena, birds flight, clouds, rain. There is no possibility for condemnation nor identification, projection.</strong></li>
<li>First vipassana teaching by bhagavan Buddha - have to enemies do for one month watch breath and they came back as friends.</li>
<li><strong>You divide people because of identification.</strong></li>
<li>Awareness is not a practice, not a habit, not a repetition. Awareness will always be fresh.</li>
<li>Meditation is not an act. It is being. It is atma. That&rsquo;s why it does not help phalam.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="43httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmdm0yaawoeq---verse-13"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDM0yaawoEQ">43</a> - Verse 13</h2>
<ul>
<li>Manah is always the thought. The thought that binds.</li>
<li>Bad vasana is painful, sometimes <strong>even a good vasana becomes painful</strong>. E.g. obsessive vasana.</li>
<li><strong>Mind is vasana. Mind is in the form a few vasanas. You get only a certain kind of thoughts based on your vasanas.</strong></li>
<li>How to command the mind becomes the question of how to overcome vasanas.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline means understanding. Control means struggling.</strong></li>
<li>Not control (hathayoga), discipline - introduce some understanding into the mind.</li>
<li>Laya - vasana is resolved and it will come back. Vinasha - vasanas are vanished, destroyed.</li>
<li>Manolayah, manonashah is language unique to Ramana Maharshi, but the vision is there in Gita.</li>
<li><strong>There is the potential always, whatever has resolved, it can come back.</strong></li>
<li>1st way to command the mind: watch the mind (manovikshanam) - it becomes quiet. 2nd way is through prana you command the mind.</li>
<li>We should follow both. Watch the breath, watch the mind. Certainly watching the mind is superior.</li>
<li>Watching the mind doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the mind, only the vasanas.</li>
<li>Breath meditation may lead to naya, but will not lead to nasha. Supplement it with watching the mind.</li>
<li>sa:chilA - is it not so.</li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;re born from thought.</strong></li>
<li>Manonashah - complete doing away with vasanas that bind us in this world. Fears and desires.</li>
<li><strong>Sastra says the physical is less valuable than the subtle.</strong> Outside puja is less valuable than the inner. What you do with body (pujanam) is good, what you do with vac (japah) is better, what you do with mind (cintanam) is best.</li>
<li>Swami TV: one time I noticed I&rsquo;m stingy. When I noticed it was gone.</li>
<li>Suppose you know that you&rsquo;re in a certain condition, in a certain state. <strong>You know and acknowledge that (without condemnation), that is already a process of liberation. You become free tom that. That&rsquo;s the power of knowing.</strong></li>
<li>Confusion is the name for avidya.</li>
<li>Ramakrishna: a person knows god without knowing why he loves god. That is bhakti. That is liberation. But we practice religion as a means of security.</li>
<li>What is sanyasa? You might have a bank account, but you don&rsquo;t need the security of bank account. Psychological dependence on the bank account is a vasana.</li>
<li><strong>Question your motive.</strong> Ask yourself why do you &hellip; practice the religion you&rsquo;re practicing? etc.</li>
<li><strong>In Gita all motivated effort is not accepted. It is not against effort.</strong></li>
<li>Ask yourself. <strong>Are my ways godly? My thoughts are they godly? My existence is it godly?</strong></li>
<li>Once you connect god to the vasana, the vasana will not go. God is very powerful.</li>
<li>You must be simple inwardly only then you can be simple outwardly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="44httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvs9xa402pqpe---verse-14"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Xa402PqpE">44</a> - Verse 14</h2>
<ul>
<li>What are you seeking, you&rsquo;re that already.</li>
<li>Did you notice. <strong>There is not much talk of God, there is only talk of moksha - freedom from bondage.</strong></li>
<li>Search for God started after 10th century. In Gita Arjuna asked so many question. Did he aver asked how God is? Your innermost self is the goal.</li>
<li>Even in Gita bhashya. Shankara might start with brahman, but he doesn&rsquo;t take much time to switch over to atma. And later he says the two are the same.</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m that why I&rsquo;m not feeling that I&rsquo;m that? Mind is the culprit.</li>
<li><strong>What you call body is an idea of the mind.</strong></li>
<li>Do you have an body when you do not think of the body?</li>
<li><strong>There is an illness only when you think of it. The illness is not there, if you do not think of it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is the world you&rsquo;re talking about? Do you have a world without mind and sense organs?  They work in tandem and only then you have a world.</strong></li>
<li><strong>And then you need a god. To create that world. You&rsquo;re that God. Because you&rsquo;re illuminating the mind.</strong></li>
<li>Three kinds of screens for atma: thick (tamoguna), opaque (rajoguna), transparent (sattvaguna). How does the screen (mind) cover up - it produces a variety of thoughts, beliefs, emotions &hellip; non-stop.</li>
<li>What we&rsquo;re looking for is vasanas becoming weak.</li>
<li>The idea is. You have to love the spouse. Not get attached. That&rsquo;s poison while love is very full-filling.</li>
<li><strong>Nowadays psychiatrist don&rsquo;t counsel. Everybody wants fast results, so they prescribe pills. Is it treatment or is it suppression? Instead of suppression they call it management.</strong></li>
<li>Suppression is called laya, vanishing is called nasha. We need laya. That is the first step. Then the treatment can begin. We need both.</li>
<li>Breathawareness helps exclusively to get rid of the nasanas, to get laya. Pranayama not only helps in getting rid of vasanas (laya) but also helps in physical heath.</li>
<li>For atma to shine in all its glory you have to get understanding (cintanam) eka (the one). It brings all vasanas to an end and mind becomes see-through.</li>
<li>Eti iti eka. That pervades the all. <strong>Because 1 you find in itself and in all the other numbers.</strong></li>
<li>The goal is not to study vedanta and become a scholar. Do you want to get rid of diabetes or do you want to become an expert on diabetes having diabetes? Vedanta is not aimed at scholarship, it is ai/med at manonasha. Vanishing of the vasanas.</li>
<li>Realization and bliss: <strong>the actions, speech, thoughts are not tied to one body mind.</strong> They include all body minds. All life-forms. This way you self is not tied to one body-mind, but has become the universal self. It is not personal anymore. You have to feel this. That is the true religion.</li>
<li>Act of understanding is a religious act.</li>
<li>When mother prepares food and serves, in that karma (work hard), bhakti (preparation with love( and jnanam (knowledge how to cook) are the same.</li>
<li><strong>Karma, bhakti, jnanam are all the same. If you try to separate them, it is the ignorance. That is the puja. There is no need for any puja.</strong></li>
<li>Adhiatma, adhibhuta, adhidaiva is the same. What I&rsquo;m, the universe, the god is is the same.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m you and you&rsquo;re I. That&rsquo;s the worship of a student of Vedanta.</li>
<li>Only adopt worships that inspire you, lead you to oneness. Or modify your existing worships.</li>
<li><strong>There is no lifeless river, mountain etc. It is awareness as river, awareness as mountain&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>Chaitanya definition: it is alive and it is aware. That&rsquo;s how you have to see the world. Don&rsquo;t set it down as inert.</li>
<li>All the divisions, everything is a play of chaitanyam.</li>
<li>Ekachintanam is a way how to do away with the egoism and merge in the universal.</li>
<li>Nobody likes persons who are always in their little-self.</li>
<li><strong>Universality is achieved by negation, putting aside the small-self, not enumerating I&rsquo;m Australian, I&rsquo;m New-Zealander, &hellip;</strong> That way life becomes very smooth. You&rsquo;ll not lose, you&rsquo;ll gain.</li>
<li>Be selfish, but the right way. <strong>Selflessness is the best kind of selfishness.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="45httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqyaq_whv87y---verse-15"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYAq_WHV87Y">45</a> - Verse 15</h2>
<ul>
<li>There must be conscious being to say mountain, only then there is a mountain.</li>
<li><strong>Anything comes into existence only when a conscious being knows it. Therefore it is not just mere existence, it is always existence+knowledge.</strong> Example: you see a mountain in a dream. Is it a mountain? If it would, your bed where you sleep would collapse under its weight. Therefore mountain is the same as mountain-thought + consciousness, therefore consciousness only.</li>
<li>Original dhAtu: nash -&gt; nasha = demolition. Disappearance is the better word, or vanishing.</li>
<li><strong>Vasana is what converts the outer stimulus into huge suffering.</strong></li>
<li>Jnani is not disturbed by wars, by what people says. He just remains very quiet. <strong>In Jnanis state of mind there are no vasanas. No thoughts generated by vasanas</strong></li>
<li>The frequency of thoughts is very high in samsaris.</li>
<li><strong>When the number of thoughts increases, the quality comes down.</strong></li>
<li>Samsari is concerned about his life. So he believes he takes care of his life.</li>
<li><strong>Uktrista yogi is not concerned about his life. Life takes are of life.</strong></li>
<li>Person is created by the mind, by vasana. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m me&rdquo;. And I&rsquo;m taking care of the body/mind. Life is taking care of the body/mind or the person is taking care of the body/mind?</li>
<li>Whatever life is left to you that will be taken care by the life that pervades the body. Jnani knows it and therefore he doesn&rsquo;t have any insecurities.</li>
<li>If the mind-created-person is put aside the body remains in good shape.</li>
<li>Teaching has become a magic wand for us. Can you see that the <strong>word &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; is teacher-centered. Learning is student-centric.</strong> Learning never ends.</li>
<li>Teaching means I know everything and you do not know anything.</li>
<li><strong>Swami-TV: I&rsquo;m not teaching. I&rsquo;m learning, I&rsquo;m inquiring with all of you.</strong></li>
<li>There is a difference between sorrow and sadness. <strong>Sorrow is debilitating. Sadness is not.</strong> Sometimes you cannot help and people cannot be helped, e.g. are unsuited to help.</li>
<li>Sadness makes you poetic, philosophic and teaches you about life.</li>
<li>Natural state of the mind is thoughtlessness, silence. Like water is naturally placid.</li>
<li>When there are so many thoughts in the mind, you cannot understand, you cannot learn. When there is one thought, then you can learn a lot.</li>
<li>If you stop thinking (excessively) you will not become a zombie. It you do not you&rsquo;ll suffer.</li>
<li>No particular thought is natural state of mind.</li>
<li>Silence of the mind is not mindlessness, is not dullness, is not inaction.</li>
<li><strong>For him there are no duties, no goals to be accomplished, no world to be saved, no students to be thought, no samsaries to be uplifted. All are uplifted already, all are brahman.</strong></li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re ajnani, all others appear as ajnanis - double ajnana. First know yourself.</li>
<li>Mahatmas photograph has no value.</li>
<li>He (Maharshi) might do a few things, but he&rsquo;s not duty bound. That&rsquo;s why sometimes he answers and sometimes no.</li>
<li>People feel good when they have a lot of things. Jnani doesn&rsquo;t need anything to be constantly happy.</li>
<li>Ashram food: breakfast: bread, peanut butter, milk, cereals, coffee, tea. Everything else is not necessary. Lunch: bread, brown rise, boil some vegetables. Dinner will be even simpler.</li>
<li>Chup meditation: <strong>There is nothing to be done, there is nothing to be avoided from doing. Because even &ldquo;I should not do&rdquo; becomes a vasana.</strong></li>
<li>Belief is there because it gives us psychological security. You seek that security that&rsquo;s why you believe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="46httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvw-zggjtb0k8---verse-16"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-zgGjTb0K8">46</a> - Verse 16</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;m that (intelligence pulsating through everything) by which I know I&rsquo;m.</strong></li>
<li>Sharanagatti - we allow the small self to surrender to the real, to brahman.</li>
<li>Samatvam - you see the reality in all in-spite of outward differences.</li>
<li><strong>Live a life inspired by love and guided by knowledge.</strong> Understanding helps to move forward in the right direction, love to connect to others.</li>
<li>Small self is guiding you to perform something to get the reward, or to get psychological security. Because people are concerned about them selves. That is not karma yoga. Karma yoga is about the absence of self-interest. Desire is not involved with karmayoga.</li>
<li><strong>Phalam is the self interest. Give that up and work.</strong> Don&rsquo;t try to manipulate the phalam - I will cause that phala by this karma.</li>
<li>People thing going to the temple and worshiping the god there is karma yoga. That is not necessary. Going to the office can be karma yoga.</li>
<li>In India it was never about god. It was always about freedom. <strong>Arjuna is asking for freedom (from confusion), not about god.</strong></li>
<li>First before answering the question &ldquo;is there a god?&rdquo; let us discuss what is god.</li>
<li>In life there are no yes/no answers.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not at all attached, maybe then we can say &ldquo;you&rsquo;re playing a role&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re cit but you don&rsquo;t know that. So you allow yourself to become citta (thought) then you see something nice and want to have it. That&rsquo;s the downfall. From awareness absolute to the outward thing (drshya, the seen), the nama rupa. The real drashta is the caitanyam, everything else is the drsya.</li>
<li>Example for samsara, downfall of the cit: pure water coming from the mountain top becomes muddy.</li>
<li>Cellphone as become like an umbilical cord to the outward thing - drshya.</li>
<li><strong>When there is internet, people cannot go inward.</strong></li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve become very bahirmukha - outwardgoing people. We&rsquo;ve to reverse the direction. That&rsquo;s Vedanta.</li>
<li>The sense of I&rsquo;m - aham asmi - has no location. Initially we say it&rsquo;s in the heart, because otherwise you&rsquo;ll be in the head. &ldquo;Me&rdquo; as a location in the braincells.</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw the outgoing mind and turn it inwards.</strong> It is possible.</li>
<li><strong>An empty room is the most beautiful room. Because of space. Why do you go to beach?</strong> Because there is boundless space.</li>
<li><strong>Inner silence is same as the spaciousness. If space is beautiful, all that beauty is in you. God is in you, Truth is in you, Love in you, Beauty is in you.</strong> You&rsquo;re looking outwards for these things in vain.</li>
<li>Stop looking for something which is only within. When you go to the temple stand outside and say &ldquo;aham vijnasu&rdquo; then go inside, see all the idols and see &ldquo;OM iti brahman&rdquo;. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what is before you, it is all nama rupa. All is OM. Third, all that is god is within myself as the inner most self. Close the eyes and see. If you follow these three the temple visit is integrated in Vedanta.</li>
<li>Set your vision right. Drsyavadittam cittamatmanah.</li>
<li>You have a resistance to go within. Examine that. There might be fear of losing things of the world. Of losing your status in the society.</li>
