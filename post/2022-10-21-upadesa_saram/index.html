<ul>
<li>4 ways of spirituality: karma, bhakti, yoga, jnana. Temple provides facility for all of these. People do all four. Nothing happens, because the mind is compulsive - hyperactive. Karma becomes mechanical, jnana becomes ideation, bhakti becomes a show - you&rsquo;ll need outer symbols of love. Yoga - should be conscious, lose the eyes, be aware of every single movement the body is doing.</li>
<li>How to feel brahman? You feel full and happy for no reason. There is no sense of dissatisfaction whatsoever.</li>
<li>Pleasurability is in the excited form of mind. Happiness is in the form of shanti, quietude. That is the brahman.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re the brahman, why can&rsquo;t you feel it? Because the mind is making too much noise. Like when there are too many clouds on a shiny day.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re unable to stop thinking. Thought has become compulsive. People suffer because of compulsive thinking.</li>
<li>Mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly it becomes very destructive.</li>
<li>This is not kali-yuga. This is pill-yuga. Because people are anxious and don&rsquo;t have patience. Don&rsquo;t start with pills. Start with jogging or a trainer.</li>
<li>Mind throws an opaque screen of labels and images on the vision, bhavana, love.
<ul>
<li>Mind wants to bite into a problem. Like a dog needs a bone to bite into.</li>
<li>Most of the problems are imagined only. They are very subjective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ego (me and mine) is located in the brain, not knee, belly etc. Feel it there. Therefore leave the head alone and begin with the heart. Abide there.</li>
<li>sa:stha -&gt; en:stay</li>
<li>Mind should identify with its source &ldquo;sva&rdquo; - atma. Not with the outer. So it develop the quietude and merges in its source and abides in the heart.</li>
<li>In karmayoga the mind totally gets absorbed in the work you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s called karmasamadhi. That&rsquo;s what you need, not karma per se.</li>
<li>In bhakti (sharanagati) the me, the mind, surrenders completely and there is communion with god in the heart. In bhakti you do not know why you love God.
<ul>
<li>One becomes unconscious of things. No mind. No mine.</li>
<li>No care even for one own&rsquo;s body. No me. You become indifferent (not careless).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Love with understanding is bhakti. Understanding with love is jnanam.</li>
<li>Whatever you think with the mind is not Ishvara. Mind resolved in the heart, that is Ishvara.</li>
<li>Bhakta, karma, yoga, jnanam are not four things. But an unified vision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="src2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcot9bb_uetq"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coT9bB_UEtQ">src2</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Once the mind becomes calm it resolves in the being.</li>
<li>You need a mechanism to calm down the mind. That mechanism is the prana. Because it&rsquo;s between the matter (gross) and the mind (subtle), it&rsquo;s an escape mechanism from the bondage.
<ul>
<li>hold the breath for 30-35 secs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parallel to buddhist vipassana.</li>
<li>Smile is the silent message of bhagavan Buddha. It is your birthright, it is love, it is freedom. Nobody can takeaway your smile.</li>
