<h2 id="40httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvotplffyhppy---verse-10"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTplfFYhppY">40</a> - Verse 10</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 ways of spirituality: karma, bhakti, yoga, jnana. Temple provides facility for all of these. People do all four. Nothing happens, because the mind is compulsive - hyperactive. Karma becomes mechanical, jnana becomes ideation, bhakti becomes a show - you&rsquo;ll need outer symbols of love. Yoga - should be conscious, lose the eyes, be aware of every single movement the body is doing.</li>
<li>How to feel brahman? You feel full and happy for no reason. There is no sense of dissatisfaction whatsoever.</li>
<li>Pleasurability is in the excited form of mind. Happiness is in the form of shanti, quietude. That is the brahman.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re the brahman, why can&rsquo;t you feel it? Because the mind is making too much noise. Like when there are too many clouds on a shiny day.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re unable to stop thinking. Thought has become compulsive. People suffer because of compulsive thinking.</li>
<li>Mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly it becomes very destructive.</li>
<li>This is not kali-yuga. This is pill-yuga. Because people are anxious and don&rsquo;t have patience. Don&rsquo;t start with pills. Start with jogging or a trainer.</li>
<li>Mind throws an opaque screen of labels and images on the vision, bhavana, love.
<ul>
<li>Mind wants to bite into a problem. Like a dog needs a bone to bite into.</li>
<li>Most of the problems are imagined only. They are very subjective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ego (me and mine) is located in the brain, not knee, belly etc. Feel it there. Therefore leave the head alone and begin with the heart. Abide there.</li>
<li>sa:stha -&gt; en:stay</li>
<li>Mind should identify with its source &ldquo;sva&rdquo; - atma. Not with the outer. So it develop the quietude and merges in its source and abides in the heart.</li>
<li>In karmayoga the mind totally gets absorbed in the work you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s called karmasamadhi. That&rsquo;s what you need, not karma per se.</li>
<li>In bhakti (sharanagati) the me, the mind, surrenders completely and there is communion with god in the heart. In bhakti you do not know why you love God.
<ul>
<li>One becomes unconscious of things. No mind. No mine.</li>
<li>No care even for one own&rsquo;s body. No me. You become indifferent (not careless).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Love with understanding is bhakti. Understanding with love is jnanam.</li>
<li>Whatever you think with the mind is not Ishvara. Mind resolved in the heart, that is Ishvara.</li>
<li>Bhakta, karma, yoga, jnanam are not four things. But an unified vision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="41httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcot9bb_uetq---verse-11"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coT9bB_UEtQ">41</a> - Verse 11</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once the mind becomes calm it resolves in the being.</li>
<li>You need a mechanism to calm down the mind. That mechanism is the prana. Because it&rsquo;s between the matter (gross) and the mind (subtle), it&rsquo;s an escape mechanism from the bondage.
<ul>
<li>hold the breath for 30-35 secs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parallel to buddhist vipassana.</li>
<li>Smile is the silent message of bhagavan Buddha. It is your birthright, it is love, it is freedom. Nobody can takeaway your smile.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="42httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvgofx8rvhpc---verse-12"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgofx8rVHpc">42</a> - Verse 12</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about God, it&rsquo;s about you. You&rsquo;ve got kriya shakti (the power of doing, vitalforce) and vijnanashakti (the power of knowing).</li>
<li>Power of doing is the prAnashakti. prAna has a synonym which is vAyu. Prana inside, vAyu outside.</li>
<li>Vijnanashakti, called also cit. Eyes seeing, ears hearing will not be enough&hellip; Mind must be there.</li>
<li>The two branches of shakti (kriya, vijnana) have the same basis - mUlam, which is the atma. Out of atma comes shakti. If atma is brahman, then the shakti is maya.</li>
<li>What is inside is outside and what is outside is inside.</li>
<li>In outside you have cosmic intelligence and the cosmic power. They have the same origin in brahman. The inside intelligence and power have the same origin in atma.</li>
<li><strong>For seeing the separation, you don&rsquo;t need shastra. If there is something common, then you need shastra. Shastra says the body mind is not important, the base is.</strong></li>
<li>Citta is different from person to person, from human to animals etc.</li>
<li>When you see it is mostly vijnanashakti. When you speak it is the combination of kriya and vijnana.</li>
<li>Shiva weds Parvati. Shiva is the atma, parmati is the twofold shakti.</li>
<li>Vishnu weds Lakshmi and Bhudevi. Vishnu is the Atma, Lakshmi is the kriyashakti, Bhudevi is the jnanashakti.</li>
<li>Observe the breathing process. It will take you to the very awareness itself. It is obvious, because prana/vayu has originated in the atma.</li>
<li>Or be aware of the thinking process. Recognize it. Don&rsquo;t contradict it. Don&rsquo;t deny it. Don&rsquo;t condemn it. Just be aware. The awareness of the chitta will take you to the source.</li>
<li><strong>Awareness is watching, observation without condemnation.</strong> Then you come to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Whatever you&rsquo;re aware of without judging, you&rsquo;ll come to understand.</strong></li>
<li>There is identification (positive thing), not condemnation (negative thing). Both are bad. Go for silent observation.</li>
<li>You disturb you don&rsquo;t watch. If you don&rsquo;t watch you don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
<li>The secrets of life one can understand by (silent) observation.</li>
<li>The personality is a myth. You&rsquo;re not a person. It is the negation of the self so the egoistic self comes to an end. Breath will continue, thinking process will continue, person will be gone.</li>
<li>Very rarely you come across a person without demands.</li>
<li>Entire religion is demands and petition to god.</li>
<li>The ego-self is there only when you&rsquo;re not alert, attentive, awarefull.</li>
<li><strong>Watch natural phenomena, birds flight, clouds, rain. There is no possibility for condemnation nor identification, projection.</strong></li>
<li>First vipassana teaching by bhagavan Buddha - have to enemies do for one month watch breath and they came back as friends.</li>
<li><strong>You divide people because of identification.</strong></li>
<li>Awareness is not a practice, not a habit, not a repetition. Awareness will always be fresh.</li>
<li>Meditation is not an act. It is being. It is atma. That&rsquo;s why it does not help phalam.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="43httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmdm0yaawoeq---verse-13"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDM0yaawoEQ">43</a> - Verse 13</h2>
<ul>
<li>Manah is always the thought. The thought that binds.</li>
<li>Bad vasana is painful, sometimes <strong>even a good vasana becomes painful</strong>. E.g. obsessive vasana.</li>
<li><strong>Mind is vasana. Mind is in the form a few vasanas. You get only a certain kind of thoughts based on your vasanas.</strong></li>
<li>How to command the mind becomes the question of how to overcome vasanas.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline means understanding. Control means struggling.</strong></li>
<li>Not control (hathayoga), discipline - introduce some understanding into the mind.</li>
<li>Laya - vasana is resolved and it will come back. Vinasha - vasanas are vanished, destroyed.</li>
<li>Manolayah, manonashah is language unique to Ramana Maharshi, but the vision is there in Gita.</li>
<li><strong>There is the potential always, whatever has resolved, it can come back.</strong></li>
<li>1st way to command the mind: watch the mind (manovikshanam) - it becomes quiet. 2nd way is through prana you command the mind.</li>
<li>We should follow both. Watch the breath, watch the mind. Certainly watching the mind is superior.</li>
<li>Watching the mind doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the mind, only the vasanas.</li>
<li>Breath meditation may lead to naya, but will not lead to nasha. Supplement it with watching the mind.</li>
<li>sa:chilA - is it not so.</li>
<li><strong>You&rsquo;re born from thought.</strong></li>
<li>Manonashah - complete doing away with vasanas that bind us in this world. Fears and desires.</li>
<li><strong>Sastra says the physical is less valuable than the subtle.</strong> Outside puja is less valuable than the inner. What you do with body (pujanam) is good, what you do with vac (japah) is better, what you do with mind (cintanam) is best.</li>
<li>Swami TV: one time I noticed I&rsquo;m stingy. When I noticed it was gone.</li>
<li>Suppose you know that you&rsquo;re in a certain condition, in a certain state. <strong>You know and acknowledge that (without condemnation), that is already a process of liberation. You become free tom that. That&rsquo;s the power of knowing.</strong></li>
<li>Confusion is the name for avidya.</li>
<li>Ramakrishna: a person knows god without knowing why he loves god. That is bhakti. That is liberation. But we practice religion as a means of security.</li>
<li>What is sanyasa? You might have a bank account, but you don&rsquo;t need the security of bank account. Psychological dependence on the bank account is a vasana.</li>
<li><strong>Question your motive.</strong> Ask yourself why do you &hellip; practice the religion you&rsquo;re practicing? etc.</li>
<li><strong>In Gita all motivated effort is not accepted. It is not against effort.</strong></li>
<li>Ask yourself. <strong>Are my ways godly? My thoughts are they godly? My existence is it godly?</strong></li>
<li>Once you connect god to the vasana, the vasana will not go. God is very powerful.</li>
<li>You must be simple inwardly only then you can be simple outwardly.</li>
