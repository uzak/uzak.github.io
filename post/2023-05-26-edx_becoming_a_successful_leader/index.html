<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?language=en">TED: How to start a movement</a>: Leadership is over-glorified. <strong>It is really the first follower that transforms the &ldquo;Lone Nut&rdquo; into a leader</strong>.</li>
<li>Ursula Burns on Leading &amp; Following
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of times when I&rsquo;m the leader, yet overall I follow a bit more.</li>
<li>Leader is not a person.</li>
<li><strong>I expect every single person when called on, to step on and take charge.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take 5 leadership
<ol>
<li>Leadership is about influencing others to achieve a common goal.</li>
<li>Leadership is not as complicated as we think it is.</li>
<li>Anyone can lead.</li>
<li>Leadership requires simple action anyone can do.</li>
<li>followers are also leaders. First follower tuns a lot nut into a leader.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Jim Turley: Why this matters
<ul>
<li>Teams are going to be more diverse.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse teams perform either absolutely great or absolutely awful.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EACH</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Empowerment - allow people to do the things their own way</li>
<li>Accountability - holding people responsible for their own actions</li>
<li>Courage - helps put people group interest above personal ones</li>
<li>Humility - foster connections and encourage people to learn from another</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="week-2---blind-spots">Week 2 - blind spots</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unconscious Bias(es). We all have, it makes us human.</li>
<li>Stereotypes:
<ol>
<li>generalizations. Mental shortcuts. We rely on them to help us save time and energy.</li>
<li>stereotypes can be misleading.</li>
<li>lead to quick, unaware perceptions.</li>
<li>can cause us unintentionally respond to people in ways that elicit from them behaviour to confirm our stereotypes.</li>
<li>Inclusive leaders are ware of the stereotypes and look for ways to educate, role model and put in place structures to lessen the impact of them on others.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Otherness:
<ol>
<li>Everyone can be an &ldquo;other&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Otherness is about being different from the dominant group.</li>
<li>In many organizations, characteristics of the dominant group become normative.</li>
<li>We only feel the need to specify group membership when it is non-dominant.</li>
<li>Inclusive leaders are aware of otherness, can emphasize with feelings of otherness and are willing to explore those feelings in themselves.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="week-3---each-framework">Week 3 - EACH framework</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every time you&rsquo;re empowering you&rsquo;re encouraging to think out-of-the-box.</li>
<li>Being hold valuable makes feel valuated, invested in the process.</li>
<li>Courage is small and simple. Letting people where you stand and demonstrating true feelings to the staff.</li>
<li>Humility is about learning. You don&rsquo;t have to know it all. You certainly don&rsquo;t know it all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Culture of accountability is all about results. <strong>See it. Own it. Solve it. Do it. You don&rsquo;t have to ask the boss for permission.</strong></p>
