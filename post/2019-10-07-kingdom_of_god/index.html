    <ul>
<li>A king might move a man, a father may claim a son, but that man can also move himself, and only then does that man truly begin his own game. Remember that howsoever you are played or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone, even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power. When you stand before God, you cannot say, &ldquo;But I was told by others to do thus,&rdquo; or that virtue was not convenient at the time.</li>
<li>Balian: &ldquo;You go to certain death.&rdquo; Hospitaler knight: &ldquo;All death is certain.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Be brave in the face of your enemies. Be upright so that God may love thee. Speak the truth always, even if it leads to your death. This is your oath and this (a slap in the face) is so that you remember it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A better world than has even been seen. A kingdom of conscience. A kingdom of heaven.</li>
<li>What is Jerusalem worth? Nothing. Everything.</li>
