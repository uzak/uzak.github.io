    <h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>Based on the book from <strong>Nedra Glover Tawwab</strong>: <em>Set Boundaries Find Peace</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Boundaries are expectations and needs that help you feel safe and comfortable in your relationships.</li>
<li>A boundary is a cue to others about how to treat you.</li>
<li>When we’re resentful, we do things out of obligation to others instead from the joy of helping.</li>
<li>Realistic expectations don’t lead to stress</li>
<li>A lack of understanding about boundaries breeds unhealthy habits</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-levels">Three levels</h3>
<ul>
<li>Porous: week or poorly expressed and are unintentionally harmful.</li>
<li>Rigid: keep others out as a way to keep yourself safe</li>
<li>Healthy: possible when you your past doesn’t show up in your present interactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pushback: manifestation of the fear that things will be different.
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge that you heard the other person’s concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit Testing:
<ul>
<li>be clear about the behaviour you notice. Name it: “you’re testing my limits”. Express how testing your boundaries makes you feel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rationalizing and Questioning
<ul>
<li>it isn’t helpful to say you’re sorry about setting a boundary.</li>
<li>people benefit from you not having limits. You have to look out for yourself</li>
<li>be careful not to explain yourself. Keep your response short by saying something like this: “This is what’s healthy for me.” Saying too much will put you in a back-and-forth negotiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defensiveness: people turn the issue on you.
<ul>
<li>Be clear. Say something soon.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t talk about old issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ghosting: disappearing.
<ul>
<li>Send a precise text message or email mentioning the behaviour you’re noticing. Express how the ghosting is making you feel and the concerns you have about the relationship. If receiving a response take a few days, be clear how to restate how the ghosting makes you feel. If you don’t receive a response, remind yourself that their reaction was not about you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Silent Treatment
<ul>
<li>Verbalize: “You seem upset. Can we talk about what I said to you?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acceptance</li>
</ul>
<p>Misc:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell people what you need</li>
<li>the biggest trigger for anxiety is the inability to say no</li>
<li>true worst case scenario is avoiding boundaries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-feelings-when-we-dont-set-boundaries">Common feelings when we don&rsquo;t set boundaries:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resentment</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Frustration</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoidance">Avoidance:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move away: unhealthy boundaries will follow you wherever you go unless you learn to verbalize them</li>
<li>Gossip: isn’t helpful and only leads to more resentment.</li>
<li>Complaints: won’t fix our unhealthy boundaries. Play victim. Resentment.</li>
<li>Avoidance: By not creating a boundary, I created a new problem.</li>
<li>Cutoff</li>
</ul>
<p>Misc:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the fact that the Worst-Case scenario is often the least likely to occur, our fears of the worst tend to keep us from setting boundaries. Fear based.</li>
<li>Children have never been very good at listening to the elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.</li>
<li>The experience of trauma shifts our brain and body into survival mode. This is one way which unhealthy boundaries become a tool for survival.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thought-patterns-that-prevent-us-from-setting-boundaries">Thought patterns that prevent us from setting boundaries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fear of Being Mean</li>
<li>Your Fear of Being Rude</li>
<li>You’re a People-Pleaser</li>
<li>You’re Anxious About Future Interactions After a Boundary Has Been Set</li>
<li>You Feel Powerless (and Not Sure That Boundaries Will Help)</li>
<li>You Get Value from Helping Others (I&rsquo;m a helper syndrome)</li>
<li>You Project Your Feelings About Being Told No onto Others</li>
<li>You Have No Clue Where To Start</li>
<li>You Believe That You Can’t Have Boundaries in Certain Relationships
<ul>
<li>In every relationship, you can set boundaries. It’s a matter of how you set them.</li>
<li>Hard doesn’t equal impossible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uncomfortable-feelings-that-may-arise-from-setting-boundaries">Uncomfortable Feelings that may arise from setting boundaries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guilt
<ul>
<li>there is no such thing as guilt-free boundaries. Guilt is part of this process.</li>
<li>Guilt isn’t a limitation to setting boundaries. It’s a feeling. And like all feelings, guilt will come and go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sadness
<ul>
<li>Boundaries are a way to maintain the health and integrity of a relationship.</li>
<li>Boundaries are a way of saying “I love myself”.</li>
<li>We assume that people will be unable to handle it, but this is also worst-case-scenario thinking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Betrayal: Don’t betray yourself to please others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-things-that-prolong-uncomfortable-feelings">Three things that prolong uncomfortable feelings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimizing: This is the result of denying the impact of life events or trying to reduce their meaning.</li>
<li>Ignoring: You act as though your emotions don’t exist.</li>
<li>Moving on too soon: When you try to push through a painful experience without feeling your emotions, you prolong the journey of recovery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Physical: invasion of privacy</li>
<li>Sexual</li>
<li>Intellectual: You’re free to have an opinion about anything you want. And you’re free to express your opinion about anything you want. And when you express your opinion, your words should not be dismissed, belittled, or ridiculed.</li>
<li>Emotional: When you share your feelings, it’s reasonable to expect others to support you.</li>
<li>Material: posessions</li>
<li>Time</li>
</ul>
<p>People do not have to like, agree with, or understand your boundaries to respect them.</p>
<h3 id="microaggressions-small-violations">Microaggressions: small violations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assertively address what you perceive as microaggression. I’ve noticed that you said … What does that mean?</li>
<li>Suggest more appropriate behaviour</li>
</ul>
<p>Types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oversharing: effort to connect. Unusually unaware. Redirect to a more appropriate topic</li>
<li>Guilt Trips: intentionally tries to make you feel bad. strategy that people use to persuade you to do what they want.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="macroaggressions">Macroaggressions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enmeshment:  individualization is not acceptable. Neither are boundaries.</li>
<li>Codependency: belief we must help people avoid consequences, to saving them from unpleasant experiences. We think it’s our role to protect them. But in this way we enable to continue unhealthy behaviour.</li>
<li>Trauma Bonding: result of emotional and intellectual boundary violations. Over time, a person is manipulated into believing that in some way they deserve what’s happening to them.</li>
<li>Counterdependency rigid boundaries to keep people at emotional distance.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to be boundaryless to be loved.</p>
<h3 id="4-ways-to-unsuccessfully-communicate-a-boundary">4 Ways to Unsuccessfully Communicate a Boundary</h3>
<ul>
<li>passive:  denying your needs, ignoring them to allow others to be comfortable. People who communicate passively are afraid of how others will perceive their needs</li>
<li>Aggressive: attacking another person with harsh, pushy, or demanding words and behaviours, instead of stating what we want.</li>
<li>Passive-Aggressive: a way we resist directly setting boundaries. “I will act out how I feel, but I’ll deny how I feel.”</li>
<li>Manipulation: do or say things with the hope the other person will feel guilty and do what the manipulator wants. When making a deal, even if unfair, each party is aware of what they’ve agreed to do. The manipulated person often doesn’t know they’re being taking advantage of.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assertiveness is the way: “I know what my needs are, and I will communicate them to you”</p>
<h3 id="how-to-communicate-a-boundary">How to communicate a boundary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Be clear. Do your best to be as straightforward as possible. Mind your tone - don’t yell or whisper.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Directly state your need or request, or say no. Don’t just mention what you don’t like; ask for what you need or want.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Misc:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discomfort is the number one reason we want to bypass setting them.</li>
<li>setting boundaries doesn’t make you a bad person but a healthy one</li>
<li>Allow people to adjust to your boundaries.</li>
<li>repeat your boundaries, but try not to explain yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="boundary-statements-i-want-i-need-i-expect-never-use-because">Boundary Statements: I want…, I need…, I expect… Never use because.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be an excellent example of the actions you expect from others.</li>
<li>Deciding what you’ll do if it’s violated. If you do nothing, you aren’t honoring your boundary.</li>
<li>Never, Ever, Ever, Apologize!  it gives the impression that your expectations are negotiable or that you don’t believe you’re allowed to ask for what you want. Also, if you need to say no to a request, skip the apology</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="handling-boundary-violations">Handling boundary violations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Speak up in the moment</li>
<li>Verbalize your boundaries with others.</li>
<li>tell them how the violations makes you feel. Then restate what you expect.</li>
<li>Don’t let people slide - not even once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Misc:</p>
<ul>
<li>be clear, state your need, and deal with your discomfort. You can’t permit any violations to slide</li>
<li>do not offer an explanation or make promises about the future. Simply say no</li>
<li>Reduce interations: You don’t have to offer your time freely to people you find emotionally draining.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ultimatums">Ultimatums</h3>
<p>People don’t respect threats, but they can learn to respect ultimatums.</p>
<p>Misc</p>
<ul>
<li>Your boundaries are made on case-by-base basis. When you build walls, you keep everyone out, not just abusive individuals.</li>
<li>Let go: Terminating a relationship will mimic the grief process. You’re likely to experience the following: depression, anger, confusion and bargaining.</li>
<li>You might find it helpful to say that you’re setting a boundary as a way of preserving the relationship. Let them know that it’s healthy for the two of you.</li>
<li>When we don’t adhere to the limits we set with others, they won’t either.</li>
<li>Don’t just name the boundary; create realistic actions that prevent you from defaulting on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attachment-problems">Attachment problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anxious attachment: constatnly seeking validation</li>
<li>avoidant attachment: looking for reasons to justify the relationship isn&rsquo;t working</li>
<li>counterdependence: difficulty being vulnerable with others. Fearing vulnerability is fearing judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy - the experience that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we’re brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching kids to keep secrets is harmful to their growth and development.</li>
<li>If you’re in a relationship with someone who has attachment issues, instead of just accepting what you see, challenge it</li>
<li>If you’re in a relationship with someone who has experienced trauma, don’t try to do the work for them by enabling them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Misc:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can resist your urges, change your habits, and say yes only to what you deem truly meaningful, you’ll be practicing healthy self-boundaries.</li>
<li>When someone says something about me that isn’t true, I immediately correct them</li>
<li>It’s important to stick to your boundaries by issuing a consequence</li>
<li>If you don’t uphold your boundaries, others won’t either</li>
<li>If you said no, and people aren’t listening, tell them to stop asking. People keep asking because they are so trying to get you eventually to say yes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="self">Self</h3>
<ul>
<li>Self-sabotage: Self-sabotage starts in the way we talk to ourselves.</li>
<li>Self-betrayal: Pretending to be someone other than who you really are
<ul>
<li>Changing who you are and what you believe in order to stay in relationships with others</li>
<li>Comparing yourself with others, or a past version of yourself</li>
<li>Failing to consistently maintain your values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People-Pleasing: Making others happy at the cost of our own happiness</li>
<li>Consistency is Key</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-ii">Part II</h3>
<ul>
<li>We don’t naturally fall into perfect relationships; we create them</li>
<li>Unhealthy boundaries - you assume.</li>
<li>Setting Expectations The sooner the better</li>
<li>Telling your partner what you need allows them to honor your boundary. Staying quiet will piss you off</li>
<li>Your boundaries are a reflection of how willing are you to advocate for the life you want.</li>
<li>Consider the purpose of your conversation with people</li>
<li>Ask before offering an opinion, and be mindful of whether the person can handle the truth</li>
<li>People treat you according to your boundaries</li>
<li>In the case of work, it’s OK to provide details about why you’re saying no</li>
<li>Don’t offer professional services for free to friend or family. If you’re an accountant, for example, refer your friends and family to another accountant.</li>
<li>Be sure to use the “I” language. Make it about you, not them.</li>
<li>Self-discipline is the act of creating boundaries for yourself.</li>
<li>It’s your job to protect your energy</li>
<li>The moment we continue to follow something that bothers us, we agree to be bothered.</li>
<li><em>Do not take anything personally. Nothing other people do is because of you. It’s because of themselves. All people live in their own dream and their own mind. Even when the words seem personal, such as a direct insult, they really have nothing to do with you.</em></li>
<li>Personalizing assumes that everything is about you.</li>
<li>Start to believe that they’re a nonnegotiable part of healthy relationships, as well as self-care and wellness practice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>

I’m very concerned about …, but I will not enable them by helping pay their bills again.
I don’t want to be in the middle of family disputes. I will no longer be the mediator.

Please don’t speak about me and what you think of me in front of the kids
