Two more are Iliad and Odyssey.</li><li>First Vedas, then Ramayana then Mahabharata then came Puranas (mythology).</li><li>In Vedic religion they worshipped gods in the form of nature forces. E.g. Sun is the god (aditya hrdayam). Moon. Earth. Waters, Fire, Wind. Rain (Indra). Rivers.</li><li>Religion that is practices is mostly (99%) based on mythological books - Puranas. Rama is there, not replaced but all Vedic gods are replaced. Nobody worships Indra nowadays.</li><li>Religion is based mostly on belief but has a philosophic base. This makes it meaningful. If it is not there, it becomes mechanical and superstition. Without bhakti religion becomes very worldly and does not inspire anybody.</li><li>Therefore jnanam and bhakti (upasana) save the religion. Without them the popular religion based on belief becomes entire dogmatic and superstitious.</li><li>Ramayana leans more to the Vedas and less to the puranas. Mahabharata leans more towards puranas and less towards Vedas.</li><li><strong>Tulasi Ramayana</strong> - a very joyous journey. Top purana, even before Bhagavatam.</li><li>Ramayana is considered the very first poem. Adikavyam.</li><li>Vedas are humankind&rsquo;s original poetry. They are not religious texts. Got converted into religion.</li><li>The amount of misconceptions people have about Rama and Ramayana is mind blowing.</li><li>Epic is an poem.</li><li><strong>Ramayana is a love story</strong>, not a religions text.</li><li>There are two kinds of love stories. The sentiment (rasa) is either:<ul><li>shrungara - there are obstacles in the progress of love between hero and heroin. Obstacles are overcome and the whole thing ends in a comedy.</li><li>karuna - pathos, pity is the sentiment. The thing still ends as comedy. This is the sentiment of Ramayana.</li></ul></li><li>Due to Shakespeare people connect sentiment of karuna with tragedy. In Indian literature there are no tragedies. They are tabu.</li><li><strong>Uttarakanda is not part of the original Ramayana.</strong> A bad addition.</li><li><strong>Ramayana is a historic story. If an epic is not historic, it becomes a purana</strong> (mythological story).</li><li><strong>The purpose of Ramayana is to glorify Dharma (righteousness) in people&rsquo;s life.</strong> People generally have the excuses that nobody else follows.</li><li><strong>Rama&rsquo;s message to the world. Dharma is the soul of life.</strong> Not artha and kama. Those are needed for social life. Dharma for spiritual. And in Ramayana they are wonderfully united.</li><li>Rama is also ideal son, ideal brother, ideal king.</li><li><strong>Bhagavan is not god. Bhagavan means &ldquo;very revered&rdquo;. In Ramayana Rama is not a god, he&rsquo;s a human being.</strong></li><li><strong>Avatara idea of a god descending is entirely alien to the Vedas. Avatara word doesn&rsquo;t exist in Vedas, in Ramayana neither in Mahabharata (Gita). Neither in Shankarabhasya.</strong></li><li>The idea of God descending is alien to Shankara&rsquo;s vision. It started to appear in 6th CE and got popular from 11 century CE onwards. <strong>In the Vedic vision god is not above. It is among us, around us and within us.</strong></li><li>In the upanishadic wisdom you&rsquo;re a human being and have two options. There is an animal within you and there is divinity in you. Go downward or uplift yourself and <strong>rise into divinity which is already by you. That is Rama - superhuman. Hanuman are subhuman, humanoid (not animals). Ravanna is anti-human.</strong></li><li>Superhuman because he follows dharma unconditionally. Because of his qualities of head and heart. Rama as most ideal human being, having here and there some weakness also. Now you need not justify an error, because he&rsquo;s a human being. To err is human.</li></ul><h2 id=02-verses-1-3>02: Verses 1-3</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgAj5WTGaCc">src</a></p><h2 id=03-verses-4-5>03: Verses 4-5</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jur45FtpX9M">src</a></p><h2 id=05-verses-5-6>05: Verses 5-6</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6U1mVIZZU">src</a></p><h2 id=06-verses-6-7>06: Verses 6-7</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv-0K-6c_Cs">src</a></p><h2 id=07-verses-7-8>07: Verses 7-8</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJG9GnChAr0">src</a></p><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
