Two more are Iliad and Odyssey.</li><li>First Vedas, then Ramayana then Mahabharata then came Puranas (mythology).</li><li>In Vedic religion they worshipped gods in the form of nature forces. E.g. Sun is the god (aditya hrdayam). Moon. Earth. Waters, Fire, Wind. Rain (Indra). Rivers.</li><li>Religion that is practices is mostly (99%) based on mythological books - Puranas. Rama is there, not replaced but all Vedic gods are replaced. Nobody worships Indra nowadays.</li><li>Religion is based mostly on belief but has a philosophic base. This makes it meaningful. If it is not there, it becomes mechanical and superstition. Without bhakti religion becomes very worldly and does not inspire anybody.</li><li>Therefore jnanam and bhakti (upasana) save the religion. Without them the popular religion based on belief becomes entire dogmatic and superstitious.</li><li>Ramayana leans more to the Vedas and less to the puranas. Mahabharata leans more towards puranas and less towards Vedas.</li><li><strong>Tulasi Ramayana</strong> - a very joyous journey. Top purana, even before Bhagavatam.</li><li>Ramayana is considered the very first poem. Adikavyam.</li><li>Vedas are humankind&rsquo;s original poetry. They are not religious texts. Got converted into religion.</li><li>The amount of misconceptions people have about Rama and Ramayana is mind blowing.</li><li>Epic is an poem.</li><li><strong>Ramayana is a love story</strong>, not a religions text.</li><li>There are two kinds of love stories. The sentiment (rasa) is either:<ul><li>shrungara - there are obstacles in the progress of love between hero and heroin. Obstacles are overcome and the whole thing ends in a comedy.</li><li>karuna - pathos, pity is the sentiment. The thing still ends as comedy. This is the sentiment of Ramayana.</li></ul></li><li>Due to Shakespeare people connect sentiment of karuna with tragedy. In Indian literature there are no tragedies. They are tabu.</li><li><strong>Uttarakanda is not part of the original Ramayana.</strong> A bad addition.</li><li><strong>Ramayana is a historic story. If an epic is not historic, it becomes a purana</strong> (mythological story).</li><li><strong>The purpose of Ramayana is to glorify Dharma (righteousness) in people&rsquo;s life.</strong> People generally have the excuses that nobody else follows.</li><li><strong>Rama&rsquo;s message to the world. Dharma is the soul of life.</strong> Not artha and kama. Those are needed for social life. Dharma for spiritual. And in Ramayana they are wonderfully united.</li><li>Rama is also ideal son, ideal brother, ideal king.</li><li><strong>Bhagavan is not god. Bhagavan means &ldquo;very revered&rdquo;. In Ramayana Rama is not a god, he&rsquo;s a human being.</strong></li><li><strong>Avatara idea of a god descending is entirely alien to the Vedas. Avatara word doesn&rsquo;t exist in Vedas, in Ramayana neither in Mahabharata (Gita). Neither in Shankarabhasya.</strong></li><li>The idea of God descending is alien to Shankara&rsquo;s vision. It started to appear in 6th CE and got popular from 11 century CE onwards. <strong>In the Vedic vision god is not above. It is among us, around us and within us.</strong></li><li>In the upanishadic wisdom you&rsquo;re a human being and have two options. There is an animal within you and there is divinity in you. Go downward or uplift yourself and <strong>rise into divinity which is already by you. That is Rama - superhuman. Hanuman are subhuman, humanoid (not animals). Ravanna is anti-human.</strong></li><li>Superhuman because he follows dharma unconditionally. Because of his qualities of head and heart. Rama as most ideal human being, having here and there some weakness also. Now you need not justify an error, because he&rsquo;s a human being. To err is human.</li></ul><h2 id=02-verses-1-3>02: Verses 1-3</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgAj5WTGaCc">src</a></p><ul><li>Fatigue is physical, nervous, emotional, intellectual. First and last one are very useful. You&rsquo;d say by the end of the day I&rsquo;m physically tired. So is intellectual that you get by studying (classical literature, sciences, languages). As long as you have the two you&rsquo;ll be in good health.</li><li>Nervous fatigue - being anxious. Nervous system and the mind are closely connected. Nervous system has sympathetic and parasympathetic component. Whenever there is a goal to be reached, you have to run away &mldr; Sympathetic nervous system kicks in. Corresponds to rajoguna. Excitement, heat. Avoid it.</li><li>Parasympathetic is the opposite of sympathetic. It neutralizes, cools down, the troubles caused by the sympathetic.</li><li>When you&rsquo;re thinking and thinking, the NVS gets fatigued. Replace thinking with awareness. The NVS will cool down. When somebody is telling something unfavourite, listen to him coolly. Not with anxiety. That makes you fatigued. With awareness the right response will come at the right time.</li><li>Also avoid emotional fatigue. People tend to give to emotions.</li><li><strong>What you think in your head is samsara. What you contemplate in your heart is upasana.</strong></li><li>Ramana Maharshi: you need not come up. You better descend from your head.</li><li>Cave is always a secret place. Heart is compared to a cave. It&rsquo;s very precious.</li><li>Innocence is heart. Logic is head.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t live a life of logic. Better live a life of love. Don&rsquo;t be illogical but don&rsquo;t allow logic to dictate life or you&rsquo;ll be very harsh demanding person.</strong> That&rsquo;s the formula for samsara. Spirituality is reversing the journey.</li><li>Meekness. Let me not dictate, let the higher power take over.</li><li>Karma comes from head and it should be balanced with the love that originates from heart.</li><li><strong>Movement of the braincells produce thought process and in that process there is time. Love is timeless.</strong></li><li>Upasana literally means to make the mind sit close to god. Head is seat of jiva, heart is seat of deva.</li><li>Rama is the ideal enemy to Ravana.</li><li>Making Rama into god defeats the very purpose of the epic.</li><li>Upasana is the state of mind in which the vision of god penetrates every pore of the body. You&rsquo;re saturated with the divine nectar.</li></ul><h2 id=03-verses-4-5>03: Verses 4-5</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jur45FtpX9M">src</a></p><ul><li><strong>Provisional division. That is how upasana begins because that&rsquo;s what you experience.</strong></li><li>Aditya hrdayam, the word, contains the whole vision of vedantic cosmonogy.</li><li>Whatever happens at the level here, is happening at the level of cosmos.</li><li><strong>Sleep is nothing, experience of nothingness.</strong></li><li>Waking up means becoming aware. Intelligence. And then life, prana. You start moving. And with that comes matter and come to the body. Intelligence -> power -> matter.</li><li>The universe has its origin in brahman, which is intelligence (chetanam brahman). From that intelligence arises universal power (shakti), which is again brahman (like ornament that comes from gold). And then from this power comes universe. That universal power, origin of the entire universe, is called aditihi (see kathopanishad).</li><li><strong>The entire universe is display of power that is manifested - aditihi. And the power is manifested in its diversity - devatamayi, hence omnipresent.</strong> That&rsquo;s why vedic seers manifested this power as parvati or shaktihi.</li><li><strong>Brahman is parvata. And the manifest form of it, that which comes out of parvata, is parvati,</strong> associated with the changeless.</li><li><strong>Primary manifestation of the universal power is the solar orb.</strong></li><li>Some people started worshiping the power as wealth - Lakshmi. Some as wisdom - Saraswati.</li><li>Goddesses quarrelling - projection of human life.</li><li><strong>Agnihi is the most potent and very tangible, readily relatable form of the universal power. That&rsquo;s why rshi&rsquo;s started worshipping that brahman, aditih (they are the same) as fire god.</strong></li><li>Adityah - that which has originated from aditihi.</li><li>Seeing is knowing.</li><li><strong>Kashyapaha reversed is sa:pashyakah = intelligence. Rshi kashyapah was married to two women. Shaktihi is one (aditihi) - advaita. And also many (ditihi) - dvaita.</strong> All the children of aditi are devatas. All the children of ditihi were rakshasah.</li><li>Sun also has a brother. That brother is Indra, god of rains, upon which all the social life in India depends. Whenever there is a prediction that there will be a good monsoon, the ruling party wins and the stock market goes up.</li><li>Sun makes rain possible, that&rsquo;s why they are brothers.</li><li>If you focus on the forms and see multiplicity and variety and take it as real then you&rsquo;re a samsari. But if you see forms and rise above them and arrive at the one real aditi manifesting in multiple forms then you&rsquo;re a jnani.</li><li><strong>Space is gravitational energy out of which all other forms of energy have originated.</strong> Space has also originated from aditi.</li><li>Rise above your fears and desires and <strong>start doing upasana of one god. Let it be aditi - the universal power. Best altar for that is the rising and setting sun.</strong></li><li>The cosmic power not only manifests in the universe but also in your heart - aditya hrdayam. You need not search for it in the outside.</li><li><strong>First worship God mentally in your own heart. Ritual worship means mostly head.</strong> Because you had to follow the sequence properly.</li><li>Gayatri mantra is not sun-worship like pharaohs did. We worship the universal power in the alter of the sun and at the same time in the heart as aware-full being.</li><li>Be like children, be terrestrial (walk barefoot) instead of head in the clouds and reconnect with the earth. Pay attention to the feet and the earth. Make that walk for a few minutes in the morning and evening.</li><li>When walking in the forest feel that you&rsquo;re breathing the oxygen exhaled from the plants and are connected to it.</li><li>Masses practice religion as belief. You&rsquo;d practice is as direct experience. This is the true religion.</li><li><strong>Learn to rise above name and forms. You see them and then see through them. Be in communion with reality behind all names and forms. This is called God consciousness.</strong></li><li>You begin with the person. But allow the persona to merge into the cosmic self.</li><li>Worldly people are all through the day, from morning till evening ego consciousness.</li><li>There is only happiness in life. There is never my happiness. When you become egoistic the happiness comes to an end.</li><li>In the popular religion the ego is asserted again and again. In true religion, you stop asserting the ego.</li><li>Sanyasis are allowed an ego only at the time of biksha and for basic things related to dehayatra (living of the body).</li><li>Ego is the only obstacle between the truth and yourself.</li><li><strong>What is punya? Change of thought from egoism to ego-less awareness.</strong> Punya is the true religion.</li></ul><h2 id=04-verses-4-5>04: Verses 4-5</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VddzhuhHwLQ">src</a></p><ul><li>Your body (mind) will be your worst enemy if you don&rsquo;t have any control over it.</li><li>These enemies are eliminated by aditya hridayam. What is it? <strong>By the time the sun is rising you&rsquo;re up and active. You go to the upon and face the rising sun.</strong> Your heart becomes pure, because you&rsquo;re in communion with the higher power that is present before of you in the form of rising sun.</li><li><strong>You&rsquo;re what you feel, you&rsquo;re what you think.</strong></li><li>Rising sun represents the infinite power of aditihi.</li><li>Feel the body. Do two surya namaskara and after each see how light the body feels. This will keep your body healthy. This will wash away negative emotions.</li><li>Negative emotions are mostly greed (ambition) and anger.</li><li><strong>Can you live a life without comparing your self with other?</strong></li><li>An ambitious person is the most self-centered person. For him wife and children, wealth, god are all only for his ambition. That generates so much stress that the person becomes sick.</li><li>Constant struggle to become something else what you already are is very destructive. <strong>The becomer is a machine, not a human being.</strong> He&rsquo;ll never know what real joy is. There will be joy when you eat light food, go to bed early and rise up early to greet the sun.</li><li>Sun is called atitih - guest. Guest for the human race. Be ready to invite the guest with a prayer in your heart.</li><li>Prayer should not reflect your inner poverty. I&rsquo;m a sinner, give me this or that. It should reflect your divinity, sensitivity, humility.</li><li><strong>There is no righteous anger.</strong> Never ever justify the anger.</li><li>How to get rid of anger? 1. recognize there is no righteous anger. 2. <strong>look at it very objectively. Don&rsquo;t justify and don&rsquo;t condemn it.</strong> Anger is movement of mind and when you&rsquo;re aware of it (when you&rsquo;re alert), it becomes quiet.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t use sharp words with a person.</strong> That is violence. Rather talk with the person later.</li><li><strong>When you separate yourself from the other</strong> (saying I&rsquo;m brahmana, the others are sudra) - that is violence only.</li><li>There is no other. That&rsquo;s against the truth. There is only one self. No my self, no yourself. Just one self of all.</li><li><strong>Division creates fear. Fear leads to violence.</strong></li><li>What is victory? When you&rsquo;re forgotten, neglected or purposely sidelined. We become enormously hurt. OTOH you don not feel hurt, you smile inwardly. That is victory.</li><li><strong>I complain, I become frustrated, I am angry - I lost the game. I smile inwardly, that&rsquo;s victory.</strong></li><li><strong>Enduring patiently all the insensitivity from the people with a loving silence, that&rsquo;s victory.</strong> Practice these things!</li><li>You&rsquo;ll get that victory with aditya hrdayam.</li><li>People don&rsquo;t want to understand because of their sentimentality.</li><li><strong>Whatever makes your heart feel quiet, peaceful and joyous that is auspicious. Whatever eliminates the agitation from the mind an ill-health from the body.</strong> In that sense aditya hrdayam is the most auspicious.</li><li>Religious mind: in is what doesn&rsquo;t immediately hurt you but will hurt in in future.</li><li>Masses take the outward to be real.</li><li>It&rsquo;s is a unfortunate thing that a great stress is laid upon things like rituals, social customs, ceremonies, religious leaders, beliefs. That&rsquo;s popular religion. By giving importance to that you remain where you&rsquo;re. Convert that into a change of heart in yourself. That&rsquo;s the only thing that matters in true religion.</li><li>Vedantic religion: in the place of ego is put divinity.</li><li><strong>Learn to live in the present. That will be no worry, no anxiety, no fear.</strong> jo</li><li><strong>It is the time that makes you anxious.</strong> Time is the bondage.</li><li>There is no time in the sun. There is time only on the surface of time.</li><li>You can step out of the net of time as you commune with the rising sun.</li></ul><h2 id=05-verses-5-6>05: Verses 5-6</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6U1mVIZZU">src</a></p><ul><li>We have three words. Brahman (nirguna), aditi, brahman associated with aditi (ishvara). Aditi manifested as cosmic intelligence and brahman associated with it hiranyagarbha. All are same, it is the same brahman.</li><li>Aditya hrdayam helps to overcome chinta (worry - about future) and shoka (sorrow - about past).</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t depend too much on scriptural explanations. Look at the whole thing from your inner own feeling and experience point of view. Be a guide to yourself.</strong></li><li>Normally people rely upon what others say. And books. As long as you rely on those and ignoring your inner life you&rsquo;ll remain in doubt only.</li><li>Quantum entanglement: it cannot be if the particles, objects etc. are different. Quantum entablement is possible only if those differently appearing things are one.</li><li>Reality is beyond thought. Truth is formless. Form is not the truth. Form is at best symbol for the truth.</li><li><strong>When you put away your memory, you become creative.</strong></li><li><strong>IQ doesn&rsquo;t matter because it has to be put aside in an case.</strong> Don&rsquo;t differentiate into manda, madhyama, uttama. <strong>What matters is earnestness.</strong></li><li>The earnestness to know yourself becomes yourself.</li><li>In Vedic times the word &ldquo;avatara&rdquo; was only used when somebody jumped into a well.</li><li>Purana time is the Christian era (600 CE). Ramayana time is 7000 years before CE.</li><li>There is suffering in everybody&rsquo;s life. And the real <strong>cause for suffering is the self-identification with the limited and transient.</strong></li><li>Identify with the effulgence of the solar orb. Then you&rsquo;re identifying with the infinite. Meaning you&rsquo;re infinite. Aham brahma asmi.</li><li>Because of wrong ideas and identification people live in constant fear of laws. They&rsquo;re worried that they&rsquo;ll lose. What is there to lose?</li><li>Not to know and not to know that one doesn&rsquo;t know is the cause of endless suffering.</li><li>Whenever there is fear, anxiety, worry (it is human, the things will be there). First thin you do is separate yourself from the anxiety. Externalize it. Step back - I&rsquo;m here and there is the worry.</li><li>The one who eliminates fear, worry, sorrow from its heart is harihi.</li><li><strong>Do it, don&rsquo;t ask how! As you do it you&rsquo;ll get it.</strong></li><li>Hrim went to middle east and came back as rahi. <strong>Brahma went to middle east and came back as abraham. Isha went to middle east and came back as Jesus</strong>. &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;j&rsquo; are interchangeable.</li><li>Same as separating from anxiety separate yourself from pain. Watch it to externalize it. Tablets should be only a second option.</li><li>Length of the life is determined by the higher power. Not a second less, not more. That&rsquo;s the full life-span.</li><li>There is no feeling in the head. There is feeling only in the hart.</li><li>With reference to aditi always mental worship. You might offer gayatri if it is right time and place (sunset/sunrise).</li></ul><h2 id=06-verses-6-7>06: Verses 6-7</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv-0K-6c_Cs">src</a></p><ul><li><strong>Sun is not only outside, it is also inside you. Outside it is illuminating all the objects of the world. Sun is inside illuminating the eyesight.</strong> Sun is paramatma.</li><li>Visualize a miner in a coal mine. There is a headlamp. Where he looks, the entire mine remains in darkness but the one part he&rsquo;s facing is brilliantly illuminated. You&rsquo;re the miner and the headlight is your eyesight. And the light behind that eyesight is the paramatma atma chaitanyam.</li><li><strong>The ever present temple: eastern horizon. The god is hiranyagarbha who&rsquo;s the creator in the form of the sun before us.</strong></li><li>Before 10th century AD people were worshipping God in all forces of nature. At about this time idolatry started.</li><li>What is the way to worship? It is all mental worship. Make a namaskara. If you need a physical offering, do it like people did when they lived in villages and all the man bathed in the morning, even before at the well. So they were in the water when the sun rose. You don&rsquo;t need no naivedyam. No food, no flowers.</li><li><strong>People have the idea that good and bad are absolute.</strong> To injure another person is bad, a sin. In the battlefield it is good, it&rsquo;s a virtue.</li><li><strong>Absolutism in good and evil is the pain of popular religions.</strong> A very wrong idea. It&rsquo;s the hallmark of Abrahamic faiths and it&rsquo;s also very much present in the puranic faith.</li><li>Gita/Upanishads and Ramayana vision is beyond auspicious and inauspicious. The question is not &ldquo;who loves the rising sun?&rdquo; but &ldquo;who doesn&rsquo;t love rising sun&rdquo;?</li><li>Devotion ~ devata. Deity ~ devata</li><li><strong>Asuras - go out, eat and drink heavily, party. Not somebody with two horns. For a given evening, many devatas become asuras.</strong></li><li>Devatas and asuras, both love the sun. Who does not? As far as the sun is concerned, there is no distinction between good and evil.</li><li>Even non vegeterian people eat sunlight only. Plants -> Animals. <strong>Everybody is eating sunlight.</strong></li><li><strong>Each calorie is sunlight. All the food is canned sunlight.</strong></li><li>We&rsquo;re not producing coal. We&rsquo;re digging it out. Sun is producing it.</li><li><strong>All heavy elements are produced in the core of the sun.</strong> A piece of sun has come out of the sun and started going around and around the sun and started cooling. And becomes the earth. And there is gold in the crust of the earth. And we dig it out and make ornaments. Your gold ornament, all metals, have come from the core of the sun.</li><li>Wealth doesn&rsquo;t belong to humans, it belongs to paramatma who is in the form of sun before us.</li><li>sa:bhaha is the light.</li><li>You the person is not the light behind the eyes, thought process, respiration etc. You&rsquo;re nothing.</li><li>bhuvana - overlord.</li><li>Ishvara is translated as higher/highest power. <strong>Ish - power, vara - higher.</strong></li><li>We&rsquo;ve hardcoded a cause-effect relationship. <strong>You&rsquo;re looking for a cause of your happiness/unhappiness in the world. This principle of causality is the bondage.</strong></li><li><strong>Human bondage: space, time, causality.</strong></li><li>We believe we&rsquo;re the buckets and we&rsquo;re pulling the ropes. No. There is higher power who is pulling the ropes of all the buckets. By the <strong>higher power called buvaneshvaram.</strong> Smallest to the biggest is called only by one power. Same for the death of a star and a birth of an ant.</li><li>Learn to acknowledge the real power. World powers are fake powers. <strong>Don&rsquo;t take refuge in the arms of a powerful hman, but in the real power - the godhead.</strong></li><li><strong>Look at me. The eyes are the sun god, hands are the god indra. The nose is prthividevata. The ears are dig-devata. The legs are vishnudevata. The tummy, the organ of speech is agnidevata.

Rudra is the destroyer, the cosmic ahamkara.</strong></li><li>Vaishnava literature puts Shiva as destroyer, but this doesn&rsquo;t agree with the word. It agrees with Rudra. Vaishnava acharyas have an inferior feeling about Shiva. Devotees do you want to worship the god who destroys?</li><li>Vaishnavism has originated in Tamil Nadu. In madhva philosophy from Karnataka.</li><li>Creator, sustainer and destroyer are not three different gods. Those are three roles.</li><li><strong>Consciousness of the present moment is the present. There is only consciousness.</strong> Like consciousness of the pot you call pot.</li><li>Jesus Christ doesn&rsquo;t use the language of mythology nor theology.</li><li><strong>Reality associated with rajoguna becomes the creator. With sattvaguna it becomes the vishnu, the protector. Associated with tamoguna it becomes rudra, the destroyer.
