Two more are Iliad and Odyssey.</li><li>First Vedas, then Ramayana then Mahabharata then came Puranas (mythology).</li><li>In Vedic religion they worshipped gods in the form of nature forces. E.g. Sun is the god (aditya hrdayam). Moon. Earth. Waters, Fire, Wind. Rain (Indra). Rivers.</li><li>Religion that is practices is mostly (99%) based on mythological books - Puranas. Rama is there, not replaced but all Vedic gods are replaced. Nobody worships Indra nowadays.</li><li>Religion is based mostly on belief but has a philosophic base. This makes it meaningful. If it is not there, it becomes mechanical and superstition. Without bhakti religion becomes very worldly and does not inspire anybody.</li><li>Therefore jnanam and bhakti (upasana) save the religion. Without them the popular religion based on belief becomes entire dogmatic and superstitious.</li><li>Ramayana leans more to the Vedas and less to the puranas. Mahabharata leans more towards puranas and less towards Vedas.</li><li><strong>Tulasi Ramayana</strong> - a very joyous journey. Top purana, even before Bhagavatam.</li><li>Ramayana is considered the very first poem. Adikavyam.</li><li>Vedas are humankind&rsquo;s original poetry. They are not religious texts. Got converted into religion.</li><li>The amount of misconceptions people have about Rama and Ramayana is mind blowing.</li><li>Epic is an poem.</li><li><strong>Ramayana is a love story</strong>, not a religions text.</li><li>There are two kinds of love stories. The sentiment (rasa) is either:<ul><li>shrungara - there are obstacles in the progress of love between hero and heroin. Obstacles are overcome and the whole thing ends in a comedy.</li><li>karuna - pathos, pity is the sentiment. The thing still ends as comedy. This is the sentiment of Ramayana.</li></ul></li><li>Due to Shakespeare people connect sentiment of karuna with tragedy. In Indian literature there are no tragedies. They are tabu.</li><li><strong>Uttarakanda is not part of the original Ramayana.</strong> A bad addition.</li><li><strong>Ramayana is a historic story. If an epic is not historic, it becomes a purana</strong> (mythological story).</li><li><strong>The purpose of Ramayana is to glorify Dharma (righteousness) in people&rsquo;s life.</strong> People generally have the excuses that nobody else follows.</li><li><strong>Rama&rsquo;s message to the world. Dharma is the soul of life.</strong> Not artha and kama. Those are needed for social life. Dharma for spiritual. And in Ramayana they are wonderfully united.</li><li>Rama is also ideal son, ideal brother, ideal king.</li><li><strong>Bhagavan is not god. Bhagavan means &ldquo;very revered&rdquo;. In Ramayana Rama is not a god, he&rsquo;s a human being.</strong></li><li><strong>Avatara idea of a god descending is entirely alien to the Vedas. Avatara word doesn&rsquo;t exist in Vedas, in Ramayana neither in Mahabharata (Gita). Neither in Shankarabhasya.</strong></li><li>The idea of God descending is alien to Shankara&rsquo;s vision. It started to appear in 6th CE and got popular from 11 century CE onwards. <strong>In the Vedic vision god is not above. It is among us, around us and within us.</strong></li><li>In the upanishadic wisdom you&rsquo;re a human being and have two options. There is an animal within you and there is divinity in you. Go downward or uplift yourself and <strong>rise into divinity which is already by you. That is Rama - superhuman. Hanuman are subhuman, humanoid (not animals). Ravanna is anti-human.</strong></li><li>Superhuman because he follows dharma unconditionally. Because of his qualities of head and heart. Rama as most ideal human being, having here and there some weakness also. Now you need not justify an error, because he&rsquo;s a human being. To err is human.</li></ul><h2 id=02-verses-1-3>02: Verses 1-3</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgAj5WTGaCc">src</a></p><ul><li>Fatigue is physical, nervous, emotional, intellectual. First and last one are very useful. You&rsquo;d say by the end of the day I&rsquo;m physically tired. So is intellectual that you get by studying (classical literature, sciences, languages). As long as you have the two you&rsquo;ll be in good health.</li><li>Nervous fatigue - being anxious. Nervous system and the mind are closely connected. Nervous system has sympathetic and parasympathetic component. Whenever there is a goal to be reached, you have to run away &mldr; Sympathetic nervous system kicks in. Corresponds to rajoguna. Excitement, heat. Avoid it.</li><li>Parasympathetic is the opposite of sympathetic. It neutralizes, cools down, the troubles caused by the sympathetic.</li><li>When you&rsquo;re thinking and thinking, the NVS gets fatigued. Replace thinking with awareness. The NVS will cool down. When somebody is telling something unfavourite, listen to him coolly. Not with anxiety. That makes you fatigued. With awareness the right response will come at the right time.</li><li>Also avoid emotional fatigue. People tend to give to emotions.</li><li><strong>What you think in your head is samsara. What you contemplate in your heart is upasana.</strong></li><li>Ramana Maharshi: you need not come up. You better descend from your head.</li><li>Cave is always a secret place. Heart is compared to a cave. It&rsquo;s very precious.</li><li>Innocence is heart. Logic is head.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t live a life of logic. Better live a life of love. Don&rsquo;t be illogical but don&rsquo;t allow logic to dictate life or you&rsquo;ll be very harsh demanding person.</strong> That&rsquo;s the formula for samsara. Spirituality is reversing the journey.</li><li>Meekness. Let me not dictate, let the higher power take over.</li><li>Karma comes from head and it should be balanced with the love that originates from heart.</li><li><strong>Movement of the braincells produce thought process and in that process there is time. Love is timeless.</strong></li><li>Upasana literally means to make the mind sit close to god. Head is seat of jiva, heart is seat of deva.</li><li>Rama is the ideal enemy to Ravana.</li><li>Making Rama into god defeats the very purpose of the epic.</li><li>Upasana is the state of mind in which the vision of god penetrates every pore of the body. You&rsquo;re saturated with the divine nectar.</li></ul><h2 id=03-verses-4-5>03: Verses 4-5</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jur45FtpX9M">src</a></p><h2 id=04-verses-4-5>04: Verses 4-5</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VddzhuhHwLQ">src</a></p><h2 id=05-verses-5-6>05: Verses 5-6</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6U1mVIZZU">src</a></p><h2 id=06-verses-6-7>06: Verses 6-7</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv-0K-6c_Cs">src</a></p><h2 id=07-verses-7-8>07: Verses 7-8</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJG9GnChAr0">src</a></p><h2 id=08-verses-8-9>08: Verses 8-9</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfnt33nf0yc">src</a></p><h2 id=09-verses-9-10>09: Verses 9-10</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMtJkw7AMN4">src</a></p><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
