Do you want a definition so you need not to think?</li><li><strong>Better approach? What is not</strong> advaita. <strong>You discover what it is. You&rsquo;re supposed to think.</strong></li><li>Advaita is not a vada = intellectual gymnastics. Great scholarship and ability to speak well. Vada is a product of intellect.</li><li>Advaita is not religion. Religion is a belief.</li><li>Thinking and belief don&rsquo;t go together.</li><li>Beliefs get inherited</li><li>Religion divides people</li><li>Advaita is a vision, darsanam. <strong>Call it darsanam rather than jnanam.</strong></li><li>What you experience in your heart is advaita. Not what you believe/speculate in your head.</li><li>Oneness. <strong>There are not two flowers outside. There is one flower and one flower. Flowers/apples do not add.</strong></li><li>Multiplicity and reality that we experience in the world. Is it real? One is real. You&rsquo;re real.</li><li>What you can know about God in positive way is only none-sense. That god is an old guy in the cloud? The way to God is negative.</li><li>Negative understanding is the right understanding in philosophy. We&rsquo;re not in a personality development class.</li><li><strong>What remains as the residuum after dismissing all superimpositions, the nama-rupas, which are product of the human intellect. That means when the entire operation of the mind and intellect is put aside, what remains - the pure awareness absolute - that is the atma.</strong></li><li><strong>Brahman is immanent. If you stop there it becomes religion. At the same time it is transcendental - the prapancha doesn&rsquo;t exist at all.</strong></li><li>Vivekananda: every soul is potentially divine. <strong>The goal is to manifest this divinity within</strong> by work, by worship etc. This is the true religion.</li><li>Ignorant mind wants to believe rather than think.</li><li>Rituals are shaped by the desires and fears of the weak human mind.</li><li>Book, temples, forms are but secondary takes. Primary goal of human existence is to discover the divinity within.</li><li><strong>There is no myself and there is no yourself. There is one self of the all.</strong> There is no friend, there is no foe.</li><li>What god/religion is not, you have to understand. What is true religion? That&rsquo;s not the point. Supposed I tell you what it is you become my follower. And we&rsquo;ll be following a system. That will be just imitation.</li><li>I&rsquo;m not even a swami. Do you have any doubt about &ldquo;aham brahman asmi&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s your problem?</li><li>Be still and know that you&rsquo;re god.</li><li>If I&rsquo;m Swami TV how can I be brahma as Swami TV? Fact is you all can consider me Swami TV but I&rsquo;m not Swami TV. I know better than that!</li><li>World experience is no different from a movie experience. So <strong>what is there to find about the world? You want to find out what kind of snake it is?</strong> If it is not a serpent you need not find out what kind of serpent it is.</li><li>The god that you&rsquo;ll find is a conceptual god. A god that is conceived by the human mind. And the mind shapes its god according to its desires, fears and other idiosyncrasies.</li><li>Godhead has constricted itself in you as the inner most reality. If you cannot see it you&rsquo;re doing an injustice to yourself.</li><li><strong>Rise above all the divisions and be the advaya atma.</strong> That&rsquo;s the vision of Vedanta.</li></ul><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
