    <p>An ode to logic.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-knowing-and-believing">Difference between knowing and believing?</h2>
<p>Knowing is based on experience and examination and effort. Contrary to this believing is based on, well, belief. Belief is blind, it is indoctrination.</p>
<p>Interestingly belief is connected to emotions. So when it is attacked, it is defended emotionally. Knowledge doesn&rsquo;t need to be defended. It&rsquo;s validity doesn&rsquo;t rely on wishful thinking.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-reality">What is reality?</h2>
<p>What does &ldquo;real&rdquo; mean? That which does certainly exist. So reality is that which certainly is true, that exists.</p>
<h2 id="is-perception-real">Is perception real?</h2>
<p>It is a fact that we perceive. Is what we perceive the real?</p>
<p>Well first, for something to be Truth, it must be always true. It cannot change, because it would be &ldquo;not true&rdquo; and therefore false. So there is no change regarding the Truth. And if reality that which is true and therefore Truth, perceived reality is not the Truth.</p>
<p>Some languages even have different words for that which is the changing perceived reality (german &ldquo;Wirklichkeit&rdquo; and slovak &ldquo;skutočnosť&rdquo;) and that which is the ultimate reality, the Truth (german &ldquo;Realität&rdquo;, slovak &ldquo;realita&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Also see &ldquo;svet&rdquo; (the perceived <strong>world</strong>) and &ldquo;svetlo&rdquo; (the unchanging <strong>light</strong>) in slovak.</p>
<h2 id="if-the-perceived-is-not-real-why-does-it-matter">If the perceived is not real, why does it matter?</h2>
<p>Just the idea that what we perceive is not the Truth gives us fear. It shakes the world as we know it. Or at least its definition.</p>
<p>The personality is part of the perceived world. Negation of the world means also negation of the personality. If what I think I&rsquo;m is not true, who am I? What&rsquo;s real? The belief is shattered and this has some huge existential emotional consequences.</p>
<p>But to the Real the presence of belief or not doesn&rsquo;t matter in the slightest.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m the other. Whatever I can perceive I&rsquo;m not. Obviously I&rsquo;m not the person across the street. But I&rsquo;m not the body I think I&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;m not the mind (feelings, ideas). Why? Because I can perceive them. I&rsquo;m the one who perceives them and therefore different! So whatever I can think of or perceive I&rsquo;m not. Even the subconsciousness, because at least when its contents manifests I know about it. Just like I&rsquo;m not any other yet unknown object.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always the same. I know I&rsquo;m not a different person now and 5 years ago. But the person has a different body now and 5 years ago. Different ideas. Different everything. I&rsquo;m the same. I never change. I&rsquo;m not that person.</p>
<p>But wait! I cannot be the same because it would mean that birth and death have no effect on me. No? Well, the person has a birth and a death. And it is the person, its&rsquo; mouth and voice that can say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m this and that&rdquo;. If the person says or thinks it or not has no effect on my Existence.</p>
<p>Accidentally we&rsquo;ve seen that whatever is there without change, is the Truth. Jesus was right when he said <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">I&rsquo;m the Truth, the Path and Life</a>.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-the-mind-to-the-computer-make-identical-copies-which-one-is-the-real-one">Transfer the mind to the computer. Make identical copies. Which one is the real one?</h2>
<p>None is real. All are equally fine minds in the perceived reality. They will just need some ID to distinguish them.</p>
<p>The Real (Truth) is untouched by the minds.</p>
<h2 id="clone-the-body-will-the-mind-be-cloned-too">Clone the body. Will the mind be cloned too?</h2>
<p>Who knows? What&rsquo;s the mind? Is body determined by the mind or the mind by the body? I don&rsquo;t know but I know that whatever the answer, it will have no effect on the Real.</p>
