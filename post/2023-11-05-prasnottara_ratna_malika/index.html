Necklace is the chain of questions and answers.</li></ul><h3 id=q-what-should-i-hold-on-to-a-guru-vachanam-message>Q: What should I hold on to? A: guru vachanam (message).</h3><ul><li>When you hold on to the message, the person of the guru drops. Freedom and psychological dependence don&rsquo;t go together.</li><li><strong>Most bellowed brother of Rama is Bharata, not so much Lakshmana. Lakshmana thinking-less psychological dependence connected with psychical presence.</strong> There are sishyas like Bharata, who <strong>take the message, go and implement it.</strong></li><li>When a wonderful teacher and student come together there is born a great wisdom.</li><li>Outer teacher is a milestone. It tells you where to go. The ultimate teacher is the inner self.</li><li><strong>Guru is like a milestone. If you go and embrace the milestone you&rsquo;ll stay with the milestone and never reach the goal</strong>.</li><li><strong>Your inner teacher is guru vachanam.</strong> It is born out of guru vachanam. It is your inner self.</li><li><strong>The outer guru will not walk with you. Guru vachanam will.</strong></li><li>Atma is that which sees all this (waking state; sakshi) and which sees nothing (sleep state).</li><li>Once a wrong thing is put in place, it will spread.</li><li><strong>Your hope is your inner guru.</strong> Find that inner goal. Take outer&rsquo;s guru help and go within and cling to the inner guru and you&rsquo;ll be saved.</li><li>When you give importance to the outer guru the inner guru is not even recognised.</li></ul><h3 id=q-what-is-it-that-should-be-given-up-a-akaryam-wrong-act>Q: What is it, that should be given up? A: akaryam (wrong act)</h3><ul><li>Talking wrong about another person (gossip). Even if the thing is correct, give it up.</li><li><strong>See more good in the other person that the other person herself.</strong> The person will be surprised.</li><li>Try and it becomes natural too.</li><li><strong>Just like rise about attachment rise about aversion also.</strong></li><li>Love mahatma, love the other, love yourself also. Don&rsquo;t be a posture of altruism. The point is, you love all.</li><li><strong>You change the guru all the time! In fact everybody is a guru. Even a blade of grass is a guru if you&rsquo;re in learning mode.</strong></li><li>The guru should know. The guru should not be an idealog. He&rsquo;s got an idea and all the sishya has to subscribe to that idea. <strong>Guru is the one who knows the truth and has no ideology.</strong> Why should he share? Because he loves people.</li></ul><h2 id=02---verse-3>02 - Verse 3</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FX5nBOWuSM">src</a></p><ul><li>Most of the time scholarship becomes an obstacle in (family) life. You&rsquo;ll be impressed with his scholarship, not at personal level.</li><li>To understand life, scholarship doesn&rsquo;t help. In fact it might hinder.</li><li>Why children are naturally happy and we have to make enormous effort to be happy? That is samsara.</li><li>If you want to understand what&rsquo;s vitality in life, look at a squirrel.</li><li>First stage children, second stage, innocent youth. Third stage samsaris. They have to become something or the other. Compare and compete.</li><li>Samsaris are not able to disconnect. Accumulate a lot of stress and become old prematurely. Eat more, accumulate weight, illnesses. All because the mind is sick. Desires, unhappiness, insecurity, fears.</li><li><strong>Inspite of having everything around, yet there is a general sense of unsatisfactoriness.</strong> Afraid of death, afraid of life. How my life will go? Will my children take care of me or not? Will their waste resources I&rsquo;ve accumulated or not?</li><li>Samsara is very painful so religion should offer an escape.</li><li>By the time you come to 30s, 40s you&rsquo;d become intelligent and plan to break this flow of samsara that haunts us. Not after retirement. In retirement you&rsquo;ll be left with no energy.</li><li><strong>You cannot separate body and mind.</strong></li><li>When the mind is sick, body cannot become healthy.</li><li><strong>Liberation is of the self from self-imposed false ideas</strong>.</li><li>People don&rsquo;t want to know, they generally want to believe. That&rsquo;s why misinformation spreads from generation to generation.</li><li>Each experiences is time-bound, short-lived and at the end you&rsquo;re back to samsara.</li></ul><h3 id=q-of-the-tree-of-liberation-what-is-the-seed-a-samyak-jnanam-right-understanding>Q: Of the tree of liberation, what is the seed? A: Samyak jnanam (right understanding)</h3><ul><li>Experience is a mental state.</li><li>Samsara is time-bound. Moksha is timeless.</li><li><strong>Disease is time-bound. Wellness is timeless.</strong></li><li><strong>Understanding is instant and it doesn&rsquo;t accumulate.</strong> If you did not get it you did not get it. Experience however glorious it can be it may be, it cannot contain moksha. It gives a thrill for a short time.</li><li><strong>Recollection comes from the mind, memory. Spontaneity comes from the life, activity, inner consciousness.</strong></li><li>Understanding doesn&rsquo;t accumulate. It merges with you, the atma. It comes out spontaneously. You need not pull it out, you need not recollect.</li><li>Phala is always sukha dukha.</li><li>Profit or loss is not phala.</li><li><strong>Enlightenment means understanding well.</strong> There is nothing like single enlightenment. <strong>It is not one thing. It is always enlightenment of sth.</strong></li><li><strong>Learning leads to enlightenment, not accumulation. And it is an endless process.</strong></li><li>Till the last breath we learn. You leave the mind open and you have to live it. There is no end, there is no count.</li><li>If you understand and don&rsquo;t implement it in life, it means you&rsquo;ve not understood.</li></ul><h2 id=03---verse-4>03 - Verse 4</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl7Fx-mdnaA">src</a></p><ul><li>accumulated knowledge, ideas &mldr; don&rsquo;t serve, even become a hindrance when it comes to the inner journey.</li><li>understanding is not idea, not concept, not information. It does not accumulate and it helps the inner journey.</li><li>Learning is not ideas, learning is about experience.</li><li><strong>Learning and getting enlightenment is the same.</strong></li><li>Why there are 1000 names for Vishnu? Because Vishnu is infinite. You can make it 1001, 1002, &mldr; still it is infinite.</li><li><strong>Enlightenment is always in a given context!</strong></li><li>Whatever you learn, there is always a lot more to get enlighten about.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t allow the goal to justify the means.</li><li>Never ever violate dharma.</li><li>Following dharma is the easiest thing. Not following the most difficult.</li><li><strong>If you heal the mind you need not even bother about the body. Same for the spiritual.</strong></li><li><strong>Psychological wellness is called dharma.</strong></li><li>Location of dharma is the consciousness.</li><li>Exact meaning of dharma is the swarupa of a thing. Like gold.</li><li><strong>When a thing follows dharma it means it is in its natural state.</strong> And when it violates dharma, it means has gone from its natural state.</li><li><strong>If you eat too much you&rsquo;ll accumulate fat - go against dharma.</strong> Same for smoking.</li><li>Dharma is universal. Fasting or ekadashi is sectarian. Applies only to some. We need both.</li><li>What is dharma for men is not dharma for women. Feminists by trying to impose uniform dharma are making it wrong.</li><li>Dharma is that which keeps you in your natural state and hence keeps you in welfare state. <strong>Dharma is no a ritual.</strong></li><li>Healthy life - body. Happy life - mind. Not coming back to pleasure and pain cycle - moksha. Whatever secures all three is dharma.</li><li><strong>Silence and love is the natural state of mind.</strong> What is adharma? Hatred.</li><li>Cells have two ways to function. 1. for the organ to function (individual) 2. for the welfare of the entire body (universal).</li><li>Cells are living entities and know only one thing. To love.</li><li><strong>Atma has only love. Not the opposite. Mind creates the opposite of love which is hatred. Mind cannot impact the atma. Mind can impact the body.</strong></li><li><strong>All cancer cells circulating in the blood are hate cells.</strong></li><li>What can be more useful, important for you than dharma?</li><li>Love is dharma of the cells, mind, atma.</li></ul><h2 id=04---verse-4>04 - Verse 4</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25IkDu2dfiY">src</a></p><ul><li>Generally the division between outer and inner is less in India, more here (USA).</li><li>Real purity is purity of mind. That is absence of impurity.</li><li><strong>A mind free of undesirable thought patterns.</strong> Like finding bad in others. When you&rsquo;re looking for something, you&rsquo;ll find it.</li><li>What is there to gain or lose in this world? What mischief can be done to you?</li><li>Jealousy, frustration - other impurities.</li><li>When you&rsquo;re psychologically dependant you cannot be at piece.</li><li><strong>There is no &ldquo;how&rdquo; in self knowledge. You&rsquo;re the self or not?</strong></li><li><strong>You&rsquo;d learn to watch your mind. Did you ever try to watch your mind when you&rsquo;re alone?</strong> Generally people don&rsquo;t do that. Grab newspaper, book or cellphone.</li><li><strong>Just be aware of what&rsquo;s happening in the mind. Without condemnation. Without justification. It is not about time, it is about patience. About persistence.</strong></li><li>If you persistent a state will come when the mind is mostly quiet. Whatever thought is needed, it is coming. Mind becomes slowly desire- and fearless.</li><li><strong>Once you&rsquo;ll be aware of the inner beauty, you&rsquo;ll see beauty everywhere.</strong> It is always there only you&rsquo;re not aware of it.</li><li>Gap between outer in inner is much less. Inner beauty expresses in the outer more easily. Somehow everything is good. That is harmony.</li><li>Sofa will never be 100% comfortable. To whom it will be comfortable? To a healthy person.</li><li><strong>If the world is real there is no place religion. Somehow the world is not entirely satisfactory. Therefore there is religion.</strong></li><li>All of disharmony is mental impurity. By the time you make mind pure you&rsquo;re liberated person.</li></ul><h3 id=q-who-is-a-scholar-a-viveki>Q: who is a scholar? A: viveki.</h3><ul><li>Is our life guided by indriyas or by viveka? Easily understood by the example of food. By what are you guided?</li><li>Steaming > frying.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t look for the satisfaction of sense organs. Learn to live vivekijivana.</li><li><strong>Any desire/fear people have doesn&rsquo;t survive scrutiny.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=05---verse-4-6>05 - Verse 4-6</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnhHSGoVmes">src</a></p><ul><li>Guru means elder.</li><li>Elders always look towards the past, young people towards the future. They have entirely different world views - generation gap.</li><li>Youngsters are willing to learn from the societies around. <strong>Elders are frozen in their thinking. That&rsquo;s the definition of tradition.</strong></li><li>Youngsters are very selfish. It is possible that they will treat the elders with contempt. Be sensitive to counter that.</li></ul><h3 id=q-is-there-anything-in-the-worldly-life-that-is-important-a-one-thing-after-careful-thinking---put-in-hard-work-avoid-motivated-effort>Q: Is there anything in the worldly life that is important? A: One thing after careful thinking - put in hard work, avoid motivated effort.</h3><ul><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t confuse effort with motivated effort.</strong> Motivated effort is for a desire or a due to a fear.</li><li>Motivated effort with push you.</li><li><strong>Psychological fears - superstitions.</strong></li><li>Every day there must be hard work until the last breath. But it should not be motivated.</li><li>What is welfare in human life - to live with a smile and die with a smile. To live a <strong>simple, orderly and disciplined life and you move in the direction of understanding the inner self. That is welfare.</strong></li><li>You welfare lies in dispelling the ignorance about yourself. Becoming realized is the biggest service to the society.</li><li>Ramana Maharshi became realized and inspired others. He did not start a vedanta college. That is the greatest help he&rsquo;s done for society. Without moving one inch from where he lived. Without collecting a cent of donation from anybody. <strong>Svahita includes parahita.</strong></li><li>Delusion - when the person consumes alcohol and the world-view changes. Person fails to see things clearly.</li></ul><h3 id=a-me-and-mine-family-syndrome-is-as-intoxicating-as-when-one-takes-alcohol-or-drugs>A: &ldquo;Me and mine family&rdquo; syndrome is as intoxicating as when one takes alcohol or drugs.</h3><ul><li>As long as you look at the truth trough the narrow funnel of me and mine you&rsquo;ll never know the true.</li><li><strong>We sit in the cage prepared by the mind.</strong> Body limits us in space, mind limits us in our understanding. <strong>The set of ideas of the mind is the limitation.</strong></li><li>To know the truth of the self the ideas of &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; should go. Then the natural state of consciousness will come.</li><li>All ideas of god are only that much. Ideas.</li><li>All ideas of myself are only that much. Ideas. Not the truth.</li><li>One nightmare of the rich people - what will happen with the riches after my life.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be attached. Leave it up to the others.</li><li>You need a state of consciousness where you don&rsquo;t call anybody, anything my own. Where &ldquo;my&rdquo; is no more.</li><li><strong>I embrace the entire music of the world. All religion traditions are our traditions. All dance traditions are our traditions. There is nothing that is ours.</strong></li><li><strong>Then only one thing remains - survival (of the body)</strong>. Upanishads - beg for food, drink water, sleep. Everything else is extra. There is nothing like mine. There is enough for all.</li></ul><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
