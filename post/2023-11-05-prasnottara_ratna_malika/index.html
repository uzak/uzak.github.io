Necklace is the chain of questions and answers.</li></ul><h3 id=q-what-should-i-hold-on-to-a-guru-vachanam-message>Q: What should I hold on to? A: guru vachanam (message).</h3><ul><li>When you hold on to the message, the person of the guru drops. Freedom and psychological dependence don&rsquo;t go together.</li><li><strong>Most bellowed brother of Rama is Bharata, not so much Lakshmana. Lakshmana thinking-less psychological dependence connected with psychical presence.</strong> There are sishyas like Bharata, who <strong>take the message, go and implement it.</strong></li><li>When a wonderful teacher and student come together there is born a great wisdom.</li><li>Outer teacher is a milestone. It tells you where to go. The ultimate teacher is the inner self.</li><li><strong>Guru is like a milestone. If you go and embrace the milestone you&rsquo;ll stay with the milestone and never reach the goal</strong>.</li><li><strong>Your inner teacher is guru vachanam.</strong> It is born out of guru vachanam. It is your inner self.</li><li><strong>The outer guru will not walk with you. Guru vachanam will.</strong></li><li>Atma is that which sees all this (waking state; sakshi) and which sees nothing (sleep state).</li><li>Once a wrong thing is put in place, it will spread.</li><li><strong>Your hope is your inner guru.</strong> Find that inner goal. Take outer&rsquo;s guru help and go within and cling to the inner guru and you&rsquo;ll be saved.</li><li>When you give importance to the outer guru the inner guru is not even recognised.</li></ul><h3 id=q-what-is-it-that-should-be-given-up-a-akaryam-wrong-act>Q: What is it, that should be given up? A: akaryam (wrong act)</h3><ul><li>Talking wrong about another person (gossip). Even if the thing is correct, give it up.</li><li><strong>See more good in the other person that the other person herself.</strong> The person will be surprised.</li><li>Try and it becomes natural too.</li><li><strong>Just like rise about attachment rise about aversion also.</strong></li><li>Love mahatma, love the other, love yourself also. Don&rsquo;t be a posture of altruism. The point is, you love all.</li><li><strong>You change the guru all the time! In fact everybody is a guru. Even a blade of grass is a guru if you&rsquo;re in learning mode.</strong></li><li>The guru should know. The guru should not be an idealog. He&rsquo;s got an idea and all the sishya has to subscribe to that idea. <strong>Guru is the one who knows the truth and has no ideology.</strong> Why should he share? Because he loves people.</li></ul><h2 id=02---verse-3>02 - Verse 3</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FX5nBOWuSM">src</a></p><ul><li>Most of the time scholarship becomes an obstacle in (family) life. You&rsquo;ll be impressed with his scholarship, not at personal level.</li><li>To understand life, scholarship doesn&rsquo;t help. In fact it might hinder.</li><li>Why children are naturally happy and we have to make enormous effort to be happy? That is samsara.</li><li>If you want to understand what&rsquo;s vitality in life, look at a squirrel.</li><li>First stage children, second stage, innocent youth. Third stage samsaris. They have to become something or the other. Compare and compete.</li><li>Samsaris are not able to disconnect. Accumulate a lot of stress and become old prematurely. Eat more, accumulate weight, illnesses. All because the mind is sick. Desires, unhappiness, insecurity, fears.</li><li><strong>Inspite of having everything around, yet there is a general sense of unsatisfactoriness.</strong> Afraid of death, afraid of life. How my life will go? Will my children take care of me or not? Will their waste resources I&rsquo;ve accumulated or not?</li><li>Samsara is very painful so religion should offer an escape.</li><li>By the time you come to 30s, 40s you&rsquo;d become intelligent and plan to break this flow of samsara that haunts us. Not after retirement. In retirement you&rsquo;ll be left with no energy.</li><li><strong>You cannot separate body and mind.</strong></li><li>When the mind is sick, body cannot become healthy.</li><li><strong>Liberation is of the self from self-imposed false ideas</strong>.</li><li>People don&rsquo;t want to know, they generally want to believe. That&rsquo;s why misinformation spreads from generation to generation.</li><li>Each experiences is time-bound, short-lived and at the end you&rsquo;re back to samsara.</li></ul><h3 id=q-of-the-tree-of-liberation-what-is-the-seed-a-samyak-jnanam-right-understanding>Q: Of the tree of liberation, what is the seed? A: Samyak jnanam (right understanding)</h3><ul><li>Experience is a mental state.</li><li>Samsara is time-bound. Moksha is timeless.</li><li><strong>Disease is time-bound. Wellness is timeless.</strong></li><li><strong>Understanding is instant and it doesn&rsquo;t accumulate.</strong> If you did not get it you did not get it. Experience however glorious it can be it may be, it cannot contain moksha. It gives a thrill for a short time.</li><li><strong>Recollection comes from the mind, memory. Spontaneity comes from the life, activity, inner consciousness.</strong></li><li>Understanding doesn&rsquo;t accumulate. It merges with you, the atma. It comes out spontaneously. You need not pull it out, you need not recollect.</li><li>Phala is always sukha dukha.</li><li>Profit or loss is not phala.</li><li><strong>Enlightenment means understanding well.</strong> There is nothing like single enlightenment. <strong>It is not one thing. It is always enlightenment of sth.</strong></li><li><strong>Learning leads to enlightenment, not accumulation. And it is an endless process.</strong></li><li>Till the last breath we learn. You leave the mind open and you have to live it. There is no end, there is no count.</li><li>If you understand and don&rsquo;t implement it in life, it means you&rsquo;ve not understood.</li></ul><h2 id=03---verse-4>03 - Verse 4</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl7Fx-mdnaA">src</a></p><ul><li>accumulated knowledge, ideas &mldr; don&rsquo;t serve, even become a hindrance when it comes to the inner journey.</li><li>understanding is not idea, not concept, not information. It does not accumulate and it helps the inner journey.</li><li>Learning is not ideas, learning is about experience.</li><li><strong>Learning and getting enlightenment is the same.</strong></li><li>Why there are 1000 names for Vishnu? Because Vishnu is infinite. You can make it 1001, 1002, &mldr; still it is infinite.</li><li><strong>Enlightenment is always in a given context!</strong></li><li>Whatever you learn, there is always a lot more to get enlighten about.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t allow the goal to justify the means.</li><li>Never ever violate dharma.</li><li>Following dharma is the easiest thing. Not following the most difficult.</li><li><strong>If you heal the mind you need not even bother about the body. Same for the spiritual.</strong></li><li><strong>Psychological wellness is called dharma.</strong></li><li>Location of dharma is the consciousness.</li><li>Exact meaning of dharma is the swarupa of a thing. Like gold.</li><li><strong>When a thing follows dharma it means it is in its natural state.</strong> And when it violates dharma, it means has gone from its natural state.</li><li><strong>If you eat too much you&rsquo;ll accumulate fat - go against dharma.</strong> Same for smoking.</li><li>Dharma is universal. Fasting or ekadashi is sectarian. Applies only to some. We need both.</li><li>What is dharma for men is not dharma for women. Feminists by trying to impose uniform dharma are making it wrong.</li><li>Dharma is that which keeps you in your natural state and hence keeps you in welfare state. <strong>Dharma is no a ritual.</strong></li><li>Healthy life - body. Happy life - mind. Not coming back to pleasure and pain cycle - moksha. Whatever secures all three is dharma.</li><li><strong>Silence and love is the natural state of mind.</strong> What is adharma? Hatred.</li><li>Cells have two ways to function. 1. for the organ to function (individual) 2. for the welfare of the entire body (universal).</li><li>Cells are living entities and know only one thing. To love.</li><li><strong>Atma has only love. Not the opposite. Mind creates the opposite of love which is hatred. Mind cannot impact the atma. Mind can impact the body.</strong></li><li><strong>All cancer cells circulating in the blood are hate cells.</strong></li><li>What can be more useful, important for you than dharma?</li><li>Love is dharma of the cells, mind, atma.</li></ul><h2 id=04---verse-4>04 - Verse 4</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25IkDu2dfiY">src</a></p><h2 id=05---verse-4-5>05 - Verse 4-5</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnhHSGoVmes">src</a></p><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
