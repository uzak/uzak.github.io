    <p>I&rsquo;m sure many of has have pondered about the meaning of Rene Descartes&rsquo; famous statement: <em>cogito, ergo sum</em> (&ldquo;I think, therefore I am&rdquo;). But what did he really mean? I&rsquo;ve experienced this statement as a polarising one. Can it be, that he was suggesting something deeper that what&rsquo;s immediately visible?</p>
<h2 id="option-a">Option A</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen spiritually inclined people lose their nerve over how can the &ldquo;being&rdquo; be conditioned by thinking. And I was no exception. Really speaking, existence can&rsquo;t be conditioned by anything. What is simply is. A blade of grass is, even though it hardly can think. So is a stone. Or some people&hellip; But was Rene Descartes, supposedly one of the biggest thinkers humanity has ever produced, really ignorant of this rather obvious fact?</p>
<h2 id="option-1a">Option 1/A</h2>
<p>Maybe he meant something else. If being cannot be conditioned the crux of the statement must have to do with &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;. And there is two kinds of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;, both of which often gets confused with the other.</p>
<h3 id="believing">Believing</h3>
<p>For majority of people thinking means accepting knowledge and repeating it (without actually thinking). What&rsquo;s the criterion of accepting the knowledge? Basically the fact if they like it or not. Example: the WOKE movement. It fights for equality of human beings. The idea is noble - basically it is an attempt to reconstruct the paradise. But <a href="https://wmbriggs.substack.com/p/how-people-come-to-believe-something">humans aren&rsquo;t equal</a> and their idea is not based on reality. Rather on their likes and dislikes, which are so strong, that facts get ignored&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="thinking">Thinking</h3>
<p>But then there is something like thinking. Or critical thinking, if you want. It is the examination of all the known in order to eliminate contradictions. <strong>What I know I confront with everything else I know. And if there is a discrepancy, I accept that which is true, and not what I wish to be.</strong> This is how falsehood is recognized. And if we do this this process repetitively for some time, in the end only that which is always true will remain - Truth itself. And this is thinking, which carries the spirit of Socrates who said, <em>&ldquo;the unexamined life is not worth living.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In the end what Rene Descartes really meant only he will know. What matters more for me is what I think of his statement. Was this man just blind to the obvious because of the ignorance of his times? No, for me he is not an outlier, but a one of the giants upon whose shoulders our civilization is founded.</p>
