Death by self-imprisonment. We take it as normal. We look down, we don&rsquo;t look up. The unlimited sky is always there.</li><li>View from airplane offers best contrast. Problems dissolved - unlimited expansion.</li><li><strong>Sin is when things go wrong.</strong></li><li>Mistaken identity. All problems of the world arise from it.</li><li>Repentance is turning back to freedom again.</li><li>Unselfishness, you think less about me.</li><li>We&rsquo;re all mini Christs. We have to take our cross.</li><li><strong>It seems I would not say reasonable, but wonderful.</strong></li><li><strong>Where is that end where spirit, freedom begins?</strong></li><li>Whatever is happening is contained in this unchanging, ever present, presence of God.</li><li><strong>You and me and this, what is called the third point. Three - basic building components of all religions. Duality contained in the third.</strong></li><li><strong>The only problem with duality is that it is in conflict.</strong></li><li><strong>The duality is only problematic when we forget the third point.</strong></li><li>Come back to simplicity. Distrust of complexity. Common sense.</li><li><strong>This present is asking nothing of us, it accepts you as we are. Forgiveness - prime feature of this presence. Most merciful. Forgiving.</strong></li><li>Where do all these judgements come from? Not coming from user selves?</li><li><strong>Sin is mistaken identity. Sin is ignorance.</strong></li><li>Perhaps duality is ignorance of the one.</li></ul><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer><p class=post-tags><hr>Tags: <i class="fas fa-tags"></i>
