      <description>Class 1  Upadesha is instruction. In jnanam there is only instruction, no handing over. Like there is in religion - handing over a mantra. The one instructing you can call instructor. You need not instruct nobody to go to a physician when he&amp;rsquo;s ill. But when the psyche is ill, nobody will even acknowledge that he&amp;rsquo;s sick. And when somebody points out that you&amp;rsquo;re sick in the mind, you become angry.</description>

      <description>https://meduza.io/feature/2022/04/24/ukraintsev-v-mire-vstrechayut-kak-bogov-spustivshihsya-na-zemlyu  Byť autentický a rezonovať so prostredím. Nebyť len ambiciózny &amp;ldquo;remeselník&amp;rdquo;. Naše povedomie je uspôsobené na boj so divokými šelmami. Potrebujeme skúšky, vzostupy a pády. Námahu. Potom sa cítim normálne. Nemôžeme jazdiť na F1 na odpadky. Sú ľudia, čo sa cítia uzemnený, len ak majú vážne výzvy. Ináč sa strašne nudia. Ja som vo vojne vo svojom živle. Chápem mieru zodpovednosti. Bojový duch sa udržuje automaticky keď ľudia počujú pravdu.</description>

      <description>The Time Is Right for Remote Work  Office during the day has become the last place where people get their work done. Required: ability to be alone with your thoughts. Stop commuting your life away - commutes make you fat, stressed and miserable. Escaping 9am-5pm: synchronous -&amp;gt; asynchronous End of city monopoly  Industrialism (factories): gather a large number of people into small area. life need not be divided into arbitrary phases: work and retirement   Talent isn&amp;rsquo;t bound by the hubs  It&amp;rsquo;s not about the money - promote quality of life, getting best people available     Dealing with Excuses  If you&amp;rsquo;re struggling with trust issues, you&amp;rsquo;ve made a poor hiring decision.</description>

      <description>Here are some notes from the marvelous book &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be crazy at work&amp;rdquo;. If you like the notes, please consider buying the book.
First It&amp;rsquo;s Crazy at Work  Workday is being sliced into tiny moments by an onslaught of distractions. Unhealthy obsession with growth. Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it&amp;rsquo;s a mark of stupidity. The answer isn&amp;rsquo;t more hours, it&amp;rsquo;s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production.</description>

      <description>Satsang 2021-08-03  The right way to listen to a speaker is to set aside your knowledge. Knowledge - accumulation. You neither agree nor disagree with the speaker. The idea is to think about it and that is how we learn Most of meditations can be classified as fancy or imaginations. Sometimes this fancy or imaginations acquires a status of tradition. Law of repetition: whenever there is repetition it is bound to become a cult.</description>

      <description>Class 1  Small prakarana by Shankaracarya pravaha - flow, activity, current. When it comes to knowledge, there no division between east and west. Nature of work is grow, until it occupies all free time you have. It is the means that shapes the end. You won&amp;rsquo;t get the end independent of the means If bhakti is separates from philosophy, it becomes superstitious. Religion loses its transforming power. Society comes into focus, not individual liberation.</description>

      <description>Class 1  Message of hindu dharma to the entire humanity can be summarised by this single verse. IshAvAsyaM idaM sarvaM - all this is pervaded by God. anta - essence, end. Vedanta - essence of Veda. Essence comes at the end, just like dessert. pramA - correct knowledge, correct understanding. Vedanta - means of knowledge. Veda is a body of knowledge, collections of words that help us to know. Thus it is a means of knowledge.</description>

      <description>Recorded in August 2008 in Canada.
Class 1  Yoga: communion with God means god consciousness. Because it is like communion with space. It means you feel the presence of Ishwara at all times, everywhere. kamukha = lover, horny All manifestation is in the form of opposites. You cannot have a world without contradiction. You cannot have any manifestation without the dharma adharma opposites. If a person is pursuing sukha trying to avoid dukha, he is not trying to transcend.</description>

 Mind is a movement. It has to flow either towards samsara or towards Ishvara. There is no 3rd flow. As it contemplates upon Ishvara there is a reasonless joy. Mind becomes what it things upon. When mind contemplates upon Shiva that is enough to bring out inherent joy as wave after wave. Bhakti is an emotion. It is not knowledge, it is emotion. It prepares the mind for higher knowledge by purifying.</description>

 deva - shining. The one light that is always shining: consciousness. Happiness flowing from (coffee) cup into heart -&amp;gt; revert. By conditioning gold as neckless you have not made its value lesser. Gold is the origin of necklace and gold abides in the necklace. Existence has an opposite - non existence. Being has none. Being is the foundation of the entire universe. Being is atma, the essence of entire universe of forms.</description>

 The moment one customer pays you a lot more than any other customer, you&amp;rsquo;re no longer a product but a consulting company working for the big payers. You&amp;rsquo;ll do what they say. Self-sufficient. We would never allow a customer to pay more than top-tier price. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bit company with special demands, we don&amp;rsquo;t want your money. We wanted to build a self-service software company. Not need an army of key account managers keeping the whales happy.</description>

Depois da tempestade vem a bonança
Depois da calamidade vem a esperança
Como a fénix, renascemos das cinzas com a arte de viver
Depois de um expresso que navegou o submundo
Depois da noite escura da alma e da grande tribulação
Acordamos para a primavera da vida
E através das trevas chegamos sem tempo nem hora marcada
À alvorada da alma
Ainda não partiste e eu já tenho saudades</description>

      <description>notes, summary
01 INTRODUCTION  Sutra - small statement with lot of ideas packed in it. Aphorism. Audio/oral tradition, not visual. Writing was not there and even when it came, it was not used very much. A huge book can be compressed into few sutras which are memorized. Sutra method has been devised because of memory. Sutra method - putting all the ideas in metrical verse form. Poetry form. It is easier to remember a verse form.</description>

Snl-01 = Introduction  Work which deals with Siva-bhakti. Devotion is nothing but love devoted to something higher, nobler, sacred. E.g. lord, guru, parents, desha (janma bhumi). Love towards a child is called vAtsalya (affection). We have got three stages from the standpoint of devata:  Ekarupa bhakti. When the Lord is presented as a person, devotee can have a relationship. Good for maturity. Every person requires a trustworthy, reliable, stable and permanent relationship.</description>

Return with the spoils of enemies you&amp;rsquo;ve slain and my heart will rejoice. The gods of sea and sky carried me towards Troy. The walls of Troy reach to the clouds. I did not want you to escape this journey.</description>

      <description>NOTE: TOC and these notes do not strictly correspond to the order used in the book itself.
Clean Code  Code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. It is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don&amp;rsquo;t understand the risks of making messes. We are authors. Ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1. Making it easy to read actually makes it easier to write.</description>

BGUSA/dakshinamurti
Table of contents:
 TOC {:toc}  DMS-01 = Introduction  Dakshinamurti as an aspect of Lord Shiva as brahmavidya guru. Same as Hayagriva in vaishnava sampradaya. Another name for Lord Shiva as Dakshinamurti is Sadashiva. Shiva is the laya karta, one who resolves the universe, the dvaita prapanca. That destruction is relative, not ultimate destruction, because during pralaya the duality goes only to unmanifested condition.</description>

      <description>Summary
SA/EN anuvAka 1 - 11
Class 1 (2021-01-16)  Primary aspect of Rg Veda is upasana. Mental worship. In Yajur Veda focus is karma. Veda is divided into samhita (collection of mantras, hymns) and brahmana, which is dos and donts, rituals. Brahmana is subdivided into 1) brahmana 2) aranjaka 3) last portion is upanishad. We&amp;rsquo;re all devotes of supreme will. Rshih - the one who sees the truth. In Vedic times the vedic seers worshiped the same supreme will in the form of natural forces.</description>

Svetasvatara_Upanishad SA-EN 1949
Class 1: 1 / 1, 2   Compilation, thus not a systematic teaching, yet covers all the important vedantic ideas.
  Highlights isvara jnanam as the only means of moksha. Purna isvara jnanam - both saguna and nirguna version.
  Svetaashvataraupanishad: you can attain moksha through other methods other than jnanam if you fulfill this condition: you&amp;rsquo;ve to roll the sky from one side to the other just like a carpet and present it to god, god will give moksha without jnanam.</description>

Class 1: Introduction  niddhhai - deep meditation An informed seeker rejects moksha, artha, kama and goes for the only permanent goal - moksha. What is permanent (nityam) must be available in all three periods in time. If it is available in present, it must be already accomplished (siddhah). Moksha is always already accomplished fact - it can never be a goal to be accomplished in the future (sadhyah).</description>

Deixe-me ir
Nechaj ma ísť
Preciso andar
Potrebujem ísť
Vou por aí a procurar
Idem hľadať
Rir pra não chorar
Smiať sa aby som neplakal
Deixe-me ir
Preciso andar
Vou por aí a procurar
Rir pra não chorar
Quero assistir ao Sol nascer
Chcem pozerať ako sa slnko narodí
Ver as águas dos rios correr
Vidieť vody riek tiecť
Ouvir os pássaros cantar
Počuť vtáči spev
Eu quero nascer</description>

 Win an unwinnable race. The key to this challenge is to drive backwards. Ask the Lady of the Author to dance. Easy, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>source notes from vedantastudents.com  Class 1: 1, 2  2nd chapter - Mahabhuta viveka. Between elements, elementals and Atma. This world, before it was created, was sat alone. sat eva somya idam agra asit ekam eva advitiyam (Chandogya). It is difficult to see the all-pervasivnes of consciousness and ananda because it gets not manifested everywhere. That&amp;rsquo;s why here sat that is obvious everywhere is discussed. Consciousness is the invariable factor in all the experiences of all the three states and therefore consciousness is sat and beyond time.</description>

01: Introduction  Like nobody can take your medicine, nobody but you can help you with moksha. Artha, kama, dharma one cat get through a proxy. Not moksha. First three can be attained by karma. Moksha only through jnanam. Everything in the three periods of time but you exists conditionally. Three obstacles: 1) lack of preparedness 2) obstacle pertaining to the interpretation of the sastra itself (different schools) 3) logical problems.</description>

      <description>by Jason Fried.
Takedown Ignore the real world The real world isn&amp;rsquo;t a place, it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse. It&amp;rsquo;s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.
Learning from mistakes is overrated Failure is not a prerequisite for success.
People who failed have the same amount of success as people who have never tried at all.
Long term business planing is fantasy.
Start referring to any of your plans as guesses.</description>

      <description>Recorded in September 2012, source.
1: imagination vs. acceptance, mechanical vs. wonder(full)  Your attachment to the name and form acts like a shield to cover up the reality. Even while seeing the name and form you see through the name and form and then you&amp;rsquo;re in communion with reality. You&amp;rsquo;re awareness of the waking state. Not the world and person that shines through it. Samsara is put in place by identification with the gunas because of ignorance.</description>

1 &amp;amp; 2: Seeing. Exploration vs. Accumulation  Outward simplicity with inward fragmentary thinking (caste, creed, lingam&amp;hellip;) -&amp;gt; obstacle to the truth. If mind is the origin, it isn&amp;rsquo;t truth, only concept/idea. Products of the hand (objects) and of the mind (ideas) have taken over our reality. Give up all of those. (3) Always open, always learning, no conclusion. Conclusion means the truth is truncated, no longer infinite.</description>

      <description>text (PT) by Dealema:
Eu quero chegar &amp;hellip; onde ninguém chegou
Quero-me encontrar &amp;hellip; ser quem no fundo eu sei que eu sou
Nesta estrada a direção certa é em linha reta
Mas na encruzilhada qual a opção correta?
Não é fácil a decisão na bifurcação
Transversais e paralelas, eu sou um milhão
S&amp;rsquo;esta vida não fosse uma sinfonia agridoce
E a inocência não voasse depois dos doze
Numa viagem na montanha russa de emoções</description>

Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4 Verse 41 discovery, intelligence vs. machinery of knowledge
Part 1  samsara = worldliness = bondage cognitive knowledge &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; accumulated knowledge (intellect - in braincells) &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; jnanam as satyam jnanam anantam brahman (intelligence; all-pervading truth). All are called jnanam even though different in nature. Intelligence is not limited to the braincells only. In is in the braincells but not of the braincells.</description>

      <description>Formidable Vegetable: The Edge
Some people tell me that I&amp;rsquo;m crazy
&amp;lsquo;cos I do things that don&amp;rsquo;t fit in
with rest of society.
Like my love of small places
my room ain&amp;rsquo;t too large
in fact it&amp;rsquo;s a box
underneath the house
of the corner of my garage.
But the edge is where it&amp;rsquo;s at
and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to create
and my mama always said
if you&amp;rsquo;re not living on the edge</description>

  It&amp;rsquo;s the weirdest thing. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a coma for about 20 years and I&amp;rsquo;m just now waking up.
  &amp;hellip; retiring to the men&amp;rsquo;s room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a life that doesn&amp;rsquo;t so closely remember hell.</description>

 Goal: knowledge. Quality: simplicity. Have self-confidence. Be punctual, it shows you are earnest about it. Life is relationships. Try to enrich every relationship with love. Don&amp;rsquo;t put reciprocity, expectations in place. Seek love which is God. Seek freedom (psychological freedom from expectations, from seeking advantage) so you can discover that love. Love is unity in diversity. If diversity is real, there is no love. In non-duality the truth is one but appears as many.</description>

      <description>Losing all hope is freedom. Illusion of safety. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. It&amp;rsquo;s only after we&amp;rsquo;ve lost everything that we&amp;rsquo;re free to do anything. Advertising has chasing us cars and clothes. Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don&amp;rsquo;t need. Our Great War is a spiritual war, our Great Depression is our lives. Stop trying to control everything and just let go. Condom is the glass slipper of our generation.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1  Writing code without tests in general is going to lead to problems down the line. Choreographing One of the worst traps a developer can fall into is writing a bunch of code and then going back and testing it all at the end. With the advent of social networks and the ever-increasing pressure of media attention, defects in your code could be costly to both you and your reputation or that of any company you may represent.</description>

Only the faculty of cognition will be there. If you are a person, then you are not open.

Class 1, 2  Life - infinite, vast, mystery, not just an occupation. Family people, society believes life means securing livelihood. Thinking like this we miss the whole point of life. The same life in you is in a bird, sun, stars, rivers, everywhere. Hiranyagarbha. Job, marry, children and become more and more like a machine. Example: wet grinder. Remain fearful, anxious, afraid of life and death.</description>

      <description>Ashtavakra Gita - Swami Tattvavidananda
Class 1  Yoga, gym&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t neglect the body. Practical Vedanta with impact on life, not academical. Not sub-serving a system, method, formula. You can&amp;rsquo;t have both. No prioritization, just one goal. Intellect - tool for knowing - pair of tongs. Self-enquiry instead of self-knowledge. Tongs cannot catch themselves. You can only be yourself. Who are you? You are not looking for the answer but staying with the question.</description>

      <description>A king might move a man, a father may claim a son, but that man can also move himself, and only then does that man truly begin his own game. Remember that howsoever you are played or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone, even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power. When you stand before God, you cannot say, &amp;ldquo;But I was told by others to do thus,&amp;rdquo; or that virtue was not convenient at the time.</description>

1. Učení Dona Juana &amp;hellip; u nekonečne dlhej cesty sa nedá pokúsiť o nič viac, ako nájsť jej začiatok a stanoviť jej smer. Predstieranie, že cesta je pochopená a dokončená, je prinajmenšom klamaním samého seba. Jednotlivý študent na nej môže dosiahnuť dokonalosti iba v subjektívnom slova zmysle a vyprávať o nej môže iba tak, že povie všetko, čo bol schopný zhliadnuť. &amp;ndash; Georg Simmel</description>

  Life is trouble. To be alive is to undo your belt and look for trouble.
  Good or bad, what is the difference? They all end up the same way.
  A man needs a little madness or else he never dares to cut the rope and be free.
  “This is true happiness: to have no ambition and to work like a horse as if you had every ambition.</description>

CD 1 On waking up  All mystics agree: all is well. If you don&amp;rsquo;t see it, you are asleep. People don&amp;rsquo;t want to be cured, they want relief. Cure (waking up) is painful. Wise guru will never attempt to wake people up.  Will I be able to help you  I don&amp;rsquo;t expect neither to help nor to damage you.</description>

Prologue  life of solitude - either through periodic retreats or continuing inner solitude in society - may be the best answer to cries that modern world is inevitably a &amp;ldquo;lonely crowd.&amp;rdquo; your lonely quietude may be bothered by demons of lust, vainglory, or melancholy.</description>
