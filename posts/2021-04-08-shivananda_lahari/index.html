<h1 id="snl-01---introduction">Snl-01 =  Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Work which deals with Siva-bhakti.</li>
<li><strong>Devotion is nothing but love devoted to something higher, nobler, sacred. E.g. lord, guru, parents, desha (janma bhumi). Love towards a child is called vAtsalya (affection).</strong></li>
<li>We have got three stages from the standpoint of devata:
<ol>
<li>Ekarupa bhakti. When the Lord is presented as a person, devotee can have a relationship. Good for maturity. Every person requires a trustworthy, reliable, stable and permanent relationship. Emotion dominated personality - thinking won&rsquo;t be there. Dvaita approach - I&rsquo;m away from the Lord physically.</li>
<li>Visvarupa/virat/anekarupa bhakti. As maturity comes, the intellect also begins to take part in the process of devotion. Lord is no more a finite person. If you attribute a form to Lord, he&rsquo;ll be limited. Lord should include all the forms. In this stage I will never stand away from Lord, because Lord includes my form also. <strong>No more spacial division.</strong> Vishistadvaita approach.</li>
<li>Arupa bhakti. Lord as the universe is immature concept. As it is subject to arrival during sristi and departure during pralayam. And subject to modification and a mixture of pleasure and pain etc. Thus Lord has to be beyond time also - absolute form. <strong>No more time-wise division.</strong> Shantam sivam advaitam.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Three stages from the standpoint of motive:
<ol>
<li>Person, whose job is <strong>fulfilling my desires.</strong> I&rsquo;m willing to have a contract with lord. <strong>Clean commercial, conditional bhakti.</strong> Lord as a means for accomplishing worldly ends.</li>
<li>As the understanding matures, Isvara is no more a means to me. <strong>Lord becomes a himself a goal. I want security, peace, fulfillment all of which are possible only from limitlessness.</strong> Even brahmaloka falls under the net of Yamadharmaraja. Dayananda: <strong>when the one end is missed, the ends are endless.</strong> It has to be one because limitless has to be one. Every other goals (ends) will be only temporary goals.</li>
<li>Lord is neither the means nor the end. If he&rsquo;s the means it means he&rsquo;s different from me. Same for the end. As long as Lord is seen as means or end, there is bheda. Lord is myself, which need not be accomplished in time.. <strong>I understand the lord as myself.</strong> Upanishad: <strong>As long as a person looks at Lord as different from himself, he&rsquo;s like an animal</strong>, whose job is giving offerings to some devata.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Three divisions of bhakti from the standpoint of sadhana that it brings out of me:
<ol>
<li>karma. Actions, rituals, service. For the devotee Lord is more real than any other person. <strong>Initially we&rsquo;re all embodiments of laziness. Tamoguna will be only broken by rituals. Rituals are best way of burning intellectual and physical cholesterol.</strong></li>
<li>upasana. Even the most sacred action will make the mind extroverted. <strong>The bigger the ritual the more restless will be the mind. One has to turn the bahirmukha mind into antarmukha.</strong> Mental instead of physical activity.</li>
<li>jnana. <strong>Mind is ready to enquire, to study the scriptures.</strong> Vedantavicara - sravana, manana, niddidhiasanam. Highest form of bhakti.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In Sivananda lahari Shankaracarya deals with eka- and anekarupa bhakti of Siva. Lord is looked here upon as the end to be accomplished, advaitam is not given.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="snl-02---1--and--2">Snl-02 =  1  and  2</h1>
<ul>
<li>Commandments of Lord - dharma.</li>
<li><strong>Being an advaiti does not mean losing dvaita bhakti. Advaita bhakti is not opposed, does not replace dvaita bhakti. Dvaita bhakti is an ornamentation to advaita bhakti. Dvaitam is a cause of delusion and samsara only before advaita jnanam. After advaita when consciously come down to dvaita bhakti it seems even more beautiful than advaitam.</strong> Like watching a movie knowing it is a movie. Dvaita and advaita are like two channels you can change at will.</li>
<li>lahari - taranga (wave); a torrential, fast flowing, powerful stream</li>
<li>shivananda - the ananda I get through the worship of Lord Shiva; auspicious happiness - sattvic ananda out of isvara sambandha</li>
<li><strong>When ananda arises out of worldly contact that ananda is limited because the objects are limited. Therefore the ananda is enjoyable in the beginning but when it withdraws, the withdrawal symptoms from vishaya ananda is terrible.</strong> Therefore amangala anandah. Isvara is nitya and that&rsquo;s why isvara sambandha ananda is mangalam.</li>
<li>As the ahamkara I&rsquo;m full of limitations. Since from vyavaharika drsti I&rsquo;m an individual <strong>I need the grace of the Lord for every work I undertake. That&rsquo;s why even in advaita class we start with seeking the grace of Lord.</strong> Therefore Shankaracarya starts with namaskara and asks to share Shivananda with Shiva bhaktas and asks for big audience for his work.</li>
<li>Lord Shiva&rsquo;s dance is called tandavah, Lord Parvati dance is called lasyam. Both of them are great in fine art and in all forms of knowledge.</li>
<li>Lord with the moon on the head - for him time is an ornament. He&rsquo;s not beautified by the candrakala, it is the candrakala that is beautified because of the association with the Lord, as Lord is infinitely beautiful.</li>
<li>Shiva tells - because of tapas and punya I&rsquo;ve got a wonderful wife like you. Parvati tells the same. Both are happily married. Both of them are because of the mutual punyam of the other. They are responsible for prakatanam (manifestation) of other peoples&rsquo; karma phala.</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness represents Shiva. Parvati represents thought.</strong> Every jnanam that arises in our minds is a combination of both. Shiva and Parvati appear in our hearts and shine for the devotee in the form of infinite ananda.</li>
<li>Sloka 2: &ldquo;may the sattvic shivananda reign supreme in my mind&rdquo;. My my dry mind be soaked in the syrup of shivananda like a Rasagula.</li>
<li>Shambhuhu - generator of mangalam.</li>
<li><strong>Istadevata bhakti is generated only by one method. By listening to the stories of the lord and to the stories of the devotees.</strong></li>
<li>kathA -story.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="snl-03---2-6--and--9">Snl-03 =  2, 6  and  9</h1>
<ul>
<li>shivaanda lahari - artificial stream of shivananda tapped by Shankaracarya from the natural river of always flowing shiva vibhuties, from stories of shiva avatara. Connection to our mind through this work.</li>
<li>This stream of shivananda destroys all the papam.</li>
<li>The mind has always the capacity to take the form of, or the character of, an object which it thinks of. <strong>As a person thinks so he becomes.</strong> That&rsquo;s why dushsanga will make the mind dustha and satsanga will make it sat. Lord is embodiment of all the virtues so when my mind is listening to the kathas of the Lord it is attuned to these and in due course I also attain these virtues - called sympathetic vibration in physics.</li>
<li><strong>Satsanga method is a method in which I need not do anything unknowingly I adopt the character of the one I&rsquo;m associated with.</strong></li>
<li>The thoughts themselves are the pipelines which carry the shivananda.</li>
<li>The flowing stream of shivananda thoughts serves as cooling agent for the torment of samsara. <strong>Sorrow of samsara - moving from one problem to another, because the power of freewill is too small in front of the power of prarabdha. Each generates some heat which accumulates.</strong></li>
<li>Every time I listen, In the heart bed, which is none other than my mind, the stream of water get stored.</li>
<li>hrada - lake</li>
<li>bhuvi - bed</li>
<li>What memory and when comes is not under control. The activation of vasanas is not under our control. How to tackle? Keep good vasanas in the mind. So even when I&rsquo;m not in my senses, when I blabber, is only shiva.</li>
<li><strong>Memory = subconscious mind = deep heart.</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appayya_Dikshita">One guru</a> wanted to know what is in his deep heart, so he took juice of a plant that knocked him off  -&gt; he started blabbering on Lord Shiva producing <a href="https://templesinindiainfo.com/atmarpana-stuti-lyrics-in-english-with-meaning/">atmarpana</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>The ultimate goal of a human being according to the scriptures is isvara svarupa jnanam (in religious language) - only this can give is security, peace, security. brahmajnanam in philosophical language.</li>
<li>Isvara is the subject matter of both, veda purva (focuses on ekarupa, anekarupa) and vedanta (arupa).</li>
<li>Three tools/keys to open the veda box: vyakarana (padasastram), mimamsa (vakyasastram), tarka (pramanasastra).</li>
<li><strong>Trap of tarka sastra: a person analyzes so many things.</strong> You can analyze a life long. Shankaracarya: what do you get out of these things? Your throat only will get tired. Therefore surrender to the lotus feet of Lord Shiva and may you get infinite happiness and peace.</li>
<li>shamanah - destroyer, name for Yama</li>
<li>What we reject is unnatural. Mortality is unnatural since we resist it. That&rsquo;s why we call Yama ghora shamanah. The only one who can destroy yama is kalakalah - Isvara.</li>
<li>Brahmasutra: tarkasastra is least needed for vedanta jnanam. If we use logic it is to logically prove the redundancy of logic.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Shankaracarya: how long will you be obsessed with material offerings to the Lord? <strong>Your mind, individuality, ego must be surrendered to the Lord. That is one flower, one lotus - the lotus heart/mind.</strong></li>
<li>Critique of mechanical worship. The problem is when we do, the person drops even that. No worship &lt; mechanical worship &lt; committed worship.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="snl-04---9-12-22--and--27">Snl-04 =  9, 12, 22  and  27</h1>
<ul>
<li>Anything you regularly do it becomes a mechanical exercise. Thus one has to remember that physical offerings are only symbolic. Through these we only want to offer one flower - the lotus of the mind. It is offered only once. Thus <strong>collect the pieces of your mind that has been shared with near and dear and offer it as a whole to the Lord.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once the mind is offered to the Lord there is no more problems.</strong> All relationships but this are struck with expectations. <strong>Lord does not have any expectations on us.</strong></li>
<li>Lord makes the note - this person has already offered the one available mind to me. <strong>If we mean it, offering of the mind is only done once.</strong></li>
<li>Human mind has two roles to play. Karta and bhokta. In each my individuality is expressed. Thus surrendering the mind is the surrender of karta and bhokta.</li>
<li>Dharma represents God&rsquo;s will or God&rsquo;s teaching. As a karta I have two options. <strong>I can live my life in keeping with dharma which is the alignment of my individuality, my individual will with the will of Lord. This is surrender.</strong> This will be difficult because my personal raga dvesha will always challenge and suggest what is convenient and profitable. If I go by raga dvesha I&rsquo;m away from the Lord.
w* Second occasion where my individuality becomes prominent is as a bhokta. <strong>As a bhotka when I receive a result I judge the phala according to my expectations.</strong> There is resistance, irritation, frustration, anger for the resutl, directed towards the Lord. <strong>&ldquo;Why me!?!&rdquo; psychology. Thus I should willingly accept any phala of the Lord looking at is as something I deserve.</strong> <em>&ldquo;Oh Lord, you can never be unjust. I might not be able to know why I have this difficulty, but even without me knowing the cause, without a cause I cannot receive this result&rdquo;</em>. <strong>Therefore I never question the justice, the compassion, the fairness of the Lord.</strong></li>
<li>When there is resistance, mind is disturbed. When there is acceptance, there is samatvam.</li>
<li><strong>Thus surrender is leading a life in keeping with dharma and accepting all the experiences without resistance - karmayoga.</strong></li>

<li>Place of our living doesn&rsquo;t matter. It can never determine spiritual progress. Way of life (brahmacarya, grhasta, vanaprasta, sanyasi) has nothing to do with that. What matters is the type of attitude you have.</li>
<li><strong>The fish lives in pure water still it consumes the dirt that falls inside.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fixing the mind at the feet of the Lord is called yogah.</strong></li>
<li>Even when the conscious mind is caught up in vyavahara the subconscious mind should not lose sight of the ultimate.</li>

<li>Artha kama are instinctive purushartas.</li>
<li>Interestingly the sense of insecurity increases with possessions because I have to protect not only myself, but the possessions. <strong>(In)security is a feeling, it has nothing to do with external possessions.</strong> But we have a moha.</li>
<li>Kama is exactly the same. A person can never fulfill the desires and be complete.</li>
<li>Pralobhanam - temptation</li>
<li>Life requires artha and kama. Even a sanyasi needs food, clothes and shelther. We look upon money as lakshmi devi, not a daemon. But whole life cannot be spend on artha and kama alone. There should be ample time for dharma and moksha. Even when you spend 60y in artha kama, you&rsquo;d come.</li>
<li>mayI krpam kuru - show mercy upon me. And take charge of this terrible mind.</li>

<li>Gift exchange is a common practice. Upon exploration I find that the only thing you don&rsquo;t have Lord, is this mind. Please take it from me.</li>

<li>Biggest problem of any person is handling the mind. Just like a vehicle, as long as it runs, it is very good. ashantasya manah bharah - mind is the greatest problem of a person who doesn&rsquo;t have shanti. And there is no escape.</li>
<li>Often what we don&rsquo;t want we want to gift to other people. Justification: I give what the other person doesn&rsquo;t have. Gift is not supposed to be handed back.</li>
<li>svarbhuja - svarga bhumau jatah - parijata vrkshah - celestial tree.</li>
<li><strong>Advaitam: where there is gradation jealousy is bound to come.</strong> Jealousy leads to inferiority or superiority complex.</li>
<li>If an actor constantly plays female roles after some time outside also his walking, talking etc. will become feminine.</li>
<li>Differences between gods are only in the beginning level of ekarupabhakti. Immaturity is the cause of all fights between bhaktas.</li>
<li><strong>If God is incapable of doing one thing than it is rejecting me.</strong> He&rsquo;s everywhere. We always want to belong to someone. Whether I belong to other people or not I always belong to Lord.</li>

<ul>
<li>Important advaita verse: Lord please provide me with a proper guru. If there is none around, please you yourself do teach.</li>
<li><strong>Never study the scriptures independently.</strong> One needs somebody who knows the correct meaning of the scriptures.</li>
<li><strong>I can never choose the guru.</strong> To know if he understands the scriptures I would need to understand the scriptures&hellip; It should click and if it should click <strong>I require the grace of the Lord.</strong></li>
<li>Devas are also samsaris. But their jail is first class.</li>
<li>Final stage of spiritual sadhana is consistent, systematic teaching for a length of time under the guidance of a competent teacher. You can postpone it, but cannot escape.</li>

<li>Mind - receptacle for the knowledge. Balance of mind - shama, tranquility of the mind is only possible when values are there. Without values, a person cannot get an appropriate mind and without an appropriate mind knowledge cannot be received. Even it is received it cannot be retained and even if it is retained, it cannot be absorbed. Like oil on top of the water. There will be a gap between my life and what I know - I will be a hypocrite.</li>
<li><strong>Vedanta is relatively easier. A little bit sharp intellect is enough to understand. The bigger problem is tackling the mind.</strong> Vedantic benefit I&rsquo;m seeking is at the emotional level.</li>
<li>Vasana based emotions are one thing, ignorance based emotions are something else. There are many emotional experiences from the past very well stored in the mind. I don&rsquo;t know what comes when. These cannot be handled just by mere understanding. I know I should not react like that but I find it just happens.</li>
<li>Through this prayer he&rsquo;s inviting the Lord to come and handle these unhealthy, unpredictable often responses or thoughts. Shankaracarya&rsquo;s carrot: <strong>&ldquo;Oh Lord, you&rsquo;re a great hunter. The first hunter. You need not go anywhere. You&rsquo;ve got a dense dark forest here - it is my mind - with countless wild animals. Inexhaustible. Pitch a tent and stay permanently. We both get what we want&rdquo;.</strong>  If mind has to be handled, mere individual effort is not enough, grace of the Lord is also required.</li>
<li>kirAta - hunter</li>
<li>moha (delusion, wrong ideas) like taking security from outside, taking fullness from outside.</li>

<li><strong>What fear do I have? What anxiety do I have? I have a lion (lord Shiva) behind me to move around in the forest of the world.</strong> <em>&ldquo;Let the whole world go away from me. That no human being can blackmail me. Because I&rsquo;ve got the greatest support behind&rdquo;</em>.</li>
<li>Lion requires, occupies a cave. Lord Shiva needs a cave too - the mind. In all the upanishads <strong>mind is compared to a cave.</strong></li>
<li>mukha - face, mouth.</li>
<li><strong>mRgadhara - Shiva holding a deer in one hand. Deer is symbolic of the restless mind of the devotee</strong>.</li>
<li>zArdUla - tiger. Lord Shiva destroyed vyagrasura. Also an elephant demon, therefore he&rsquo;s also gajasurasamhara.</li>
<li><strong>Sign of real devotion is fearlessness.</strong> As long as we have fear, our devotion is verbal, fake devotion. A frightened devotee is a like a square round.</li>

<li>koTisUryaprabhah - Your splendour is like of a crore of suns. One sun is enough to remove the darkness of the night. Yet I find my ignorance is still there. The thickness and intensity of my internal tamah is so great that without your help I won&rsquo;t be able to remove it at all. If there is a Nobel price for ignorance, I should be getting it. Otherwise home come you&rsquo;re not known by me.</li>
<li>vArijabAndhavah - <strong>sun - friend of lotus. Lotus is only able to bloom only on the rise of the sun.</strong></li>

<li><strong>bhakti is defined as that, in which devotees mind is spontaneously fixed upon the Lord</strong> - the mind naturally gravitates towards the Lord. First it is practiced deliberately, then it becomes natural. Lord is not seen as the means for the world but the world is seen as the means for the end, the Lord. Finally Lord is discovered as I myself the absolute I which is behind all the transaction then the love for the Lord will become equal to love for myself. <strong>The greatest love for everyone is self-love.</strong> Example: like a river flows naturally towards its real origin, home the ocean.</li>
<li>ekarupa -&gt; vishvarupa -&gt; arupa bhakti.</li>

<li>sakama bhakti requires the observations of all the rules and regulations. In nishkama bhakti, where it is meant for the purification of the mind and attainment of Isvara and knowledge, even violations of the rules don&rsquo;t matter. Not that we should willingly violate, but if they happen, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li>
<li><strong>When bhakti is intense, rules become secondary.</strong></li>

<li>I&rsquo;m a stone hearted fellow and I&rsquo;m asking you Lord to come and occupy my heart. And I know you&rsquo;re a great dancer (nataraja). Therefore you&rsquo;ve to regularly practice dance. If you come to my heart, you&rsquo;ll have a hard time. My heart being very tough, you&rsquo;ll have a lot of pain in your feet. In your biography I found you enjoy dancing on rocky mountains. Then I understood the purpose is you want to come and dance in my heart. What other reason could you have to choose rugged rock if you have so wonderful places to dance. Therefore <strong>I have all the hope even though I don&rsquo;t have the qualifications</strong> that you will come down and bless me.</li>
