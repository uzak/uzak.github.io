<h1 id="1-imagination-vs-acceptance-mechanical-vs-wonderfull">1: imagination vs. acceptance, mechanical vs. wonder(full)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Your attachment to the name and form acts like a shield to cover up the reality.</li>
<li>Even while seeing the name and form you see through the name and form and then you&rsquo;re in communion with reality.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re awareness of the waking state. Not the world and person that shines through it.</li>
<li>Samsara is put in place by identification with the gunas because of ignorance.</li>
<li>Whatever happens through ignorance it does not really happen.</li>
<li><strong>Whatever you&rsquo;re really afraid doesn&rsquo;t really exist.</strong> It is caused by ignorance. Imagination: parents imagine something about the situation of the children and think that it the fear is caused by the actual situation of the children&hellip;</li>
<li>Imagination, thinking, &hellip; puts attachment, fears, desires in place. <strong>If you say it&rsquo;s difficult than it&rsquo;s difficult. If you say you&rsquo;re not worried than you&rsquo;re not worried. Samsara is there if you believe it is there.</strong></li>
<li>Desires, fears are seeds for all kinds of actions -&gt; bondage. Unless the action is done without regard to the result (karmayoga). Yoga = &ldquo;Roast the seed&rdquo; - give up all the actions born out of desire. Life will go on very smoothly. Desires don&rsquo;t give but only disrupt it.</li>
<li>Without desire you&rsquo;ll not have any fear.</li>
<li>Yoga - communion with the truth.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be greedy. Keep your honest profession. But don&rsquo;t be an ambitious, competitive worldly person.</li>
<li>Be outside of the flow of the for a time. Don&rsquo;t allow it to wonder from one place to the other. Use the mind but don&rsquo;t have the mind use you. And it will resolve in its source. Remain thoughtless.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll know the real nature of the world only when you step back. When you&rsquo;re art part you can&rsquo;t. How do you become familiar with the world? - through the mind. Stop the flow of the thought.</li>
<li><strong>By knowing the movement of the mind you can conquer the mind.</strong></li>
<li>Meditation -&gt; reaching the source of all life (cause of all the movement) and consciousness.</li>
<li>40 days challenge: stay thoughtless for 10 days for 5, later 7 minutes. Then increase to 10, then to 12.</li>
<li>Meditation effects the character of the person/mind. In meditation you discover the weakness of the mind and the very knowing of it helps you to overcome it.</li>
<li>Sattvaguna - remaining alert and watchful.</li>
<li>Bhakti - taking the spirit by the action (if there is such). Inner dimension.</li>
<li>Bhakti - receiving sukha/dukha with equanimity of mind. Rising above good/evil.</li>
<li>Bhakti - recognising, <strong>never being forgetful of the cosmic will all the time. Everything perceived is the glory of Isvara. If my personal will is pitted against Isvara&rsquo;s, I surrender mine (sharanagatih).</strong></li>
<li>Asura - given to the life of worldly pleasures.</li>
<li>Gurudom - mutual exploitation. Guru exploits the sishya and sishya exploits the guru.</li>
<li>Wealth - being the trustee of Isvara.</li>
<li>Defining characteristics of a student of vedanta: absence of comparison, competitiveness.</li>
<li><strong>We should not have any companionship in life except satsanga. If it&rsquo;s part of your duty, speak. If part of satsanga, speak. Rest of the time - maunam.</strong></li>
<li>Spirit of &ldquo;feet of Isvara&rdquo; = sharangatih. Acceptance is the main spirit of sharanagatih.</li>
<li>Mechanical -&gt; repetitive -&gt; dull mind. With a dull mind you will not be able to know the truth. You&rsquo;ll need all creativity of the mind for it. Do it with love, devotion, not mechanically.</li>
<li>If you are putting demands (on the guru) there will be no surrender. They are mutually exclusive. All your agende is given up. All Ishvara&rsquo;s agenda for you is welcomed.</li>
<li>Rising sun - linga (sign) of Isvara. Not sun worshippers, worship is of Isvara only! <strong>Suppose you don&rsquo;t get any amazement, you&rsquo;ve converted it into something mechanical.</strong> Any time you look at lingas like sun, moon there must be freshness of present movement. This way you have to visit a temple.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2-presence-in-the-heart-space-identification">2: presence in the heart-space; identification</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sarvam kalvidam Brahman. Jagat eva harih. Harih eva jagat.</li>
<li>If you have conflict in your heart, you&rsquo;ll see only conflict in the heart. What you have in yourself (in your heart) that you see in the world. Start with your heart - see the presence of Isvara in your heart. Feel it. The world is an image of your heart.</li>
<li><strong>Temple (you feel the presence of god) -&gt; heart.</strong></li>
<li>Kama is the chief villain. Then krodha (hate), lobha (greed), moha (infatuation - loving an inanimate object, because it doesn&rsquo;t love you back), mada (ego), matsarya (jealousy).</li>
<li>Vivekananda: preliminary devotion - give and take devotion.</li>
<li>Love - the only solution for conflict. But being ignorant one doesn&rsquo;t know this. So one resolves to violence. You might be able to hurt the other person, but the conflict will remain.</li>
<li>Where is <strong>Ishvara - in the heart of every living being.</strong></li>
<li>Life means thought-live only. What is your dominant thought makes up your life. Bhakti: thought-life should be dominated by the thought of love of all-pervasive Isvara.</li>
<li>Seed of all affliction is in the heart - moha = ajnanam (original sin, suksha dukham - Buddha). It is destroyed by discovering by discovering Ishvara in your heart. All the sin gets destroyed.</li>
<li>Worldly people - either living in sorrow or on the verge of sorrow.</li>
<li>(Presence - Purusha) Isvara transcends the domain of the indriyas. adhokSaja.</li>
<li>Law: whatever is put together will disintegrate. Sharira.</li>
<li>We become identified with the body because of the ignorance of the mind. <strong>Identification = ignorance. Wise people do not identify with anything.</strong> Suppose a wise man lives in a place for a year. He just walks away &hellip; nothing sticks.</li>
<li>Staff of Moses - supreme devotion to Isvara. Mystics might know, religious guys don&rsquo;t. When there is no spirit (philosophy), what remains is letter (religion).</li>
<li>(Position of) privilege -&gt; ambition, competition -&gt; conflict.</li>
<li>Deriving pleasure from (sense) objects happens through contact with sense organs. That pleasure is associated invariably with pain. If you give all pleasures you&rsquo;ll not know what is pain and arrive at unsullied joy of svarupa - nirvanasukham.</li>
<li><strong>Nirbana -&gt; Nirvana. bANa - sharp piece of metal stuck in the heart. Arrow.</strong></li>
<li>Heart is the temple and Isvara is the Lord of the temple who runs all the infrastructure.</li>
<li>Meditation upon Isvara - who is the space in the heart. Abide there, in the space-like being. Catch it by merging in it. Give up doing - moving, thinking. Doing is only required for preparation.</li>
<li>Upasana - going closer (to that being). You have to give up doing only in the beginning. After some abhyasa doing can be there, you&rsquo;ll be fixed in the being.</li>
<li>Your best friend - not in the world, not the body, not the mind - but Isvara in the heart.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3-desires">3: desires</h1>
<ul>
<li>Everybody needs a home but people use homes to aggrandize the ego. Same for other things.</li>
<li>Even saddhus aggrandize their ego by saying I have so many students or ashrams.</li>
<li><strong>Lakshmi devi doesn&rsquo;t stay at one place. She&rsquo;s always on the move leaving behind broken hearts</strong>.</li>
<li>The same 3 million dollar home that has aggrandized the ego before will pull it down later. Samsara.</li>
<li><strong>In bhoga no matter how legally acquired it is, there is always an element of impurity. Sin.</strong></li>
<li>Sruti says don&rsquo;t use black wealth for yagna. Only legally acquired, taxed money should be used.</li>
<li>Worship Parameshwara, not wealth and pleasures of this or other world - to gain self-knowledge.</li>
<li>Jnani&rsquo;s bhakti - eka-bhakti = ananja (no-other) bhakti. Bhakti not based on division. Not putting something else in between.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve performed until now so many rituals (dream finalizations - acquired things, knowledge, experience)&hellip; Are you fulfilled? Examine your knowledge. What you consider knowledge is no knowledge at all.</li>
<li>Samsara gets established in the thought-life of a person by creating value for desires (-&gt; ritual).</li>
<li>Kings enjoy great bhogas. What do they get? A lot of misery in the end.</li>
<li><strong>An ambitious man ends in despair.</strong> Ambition fulfilled -&gt; 7th heaven -&gt; giddy self-satisfied condition. As a consequence (of the phala) this will prevent understanding the body, mind and the self&hellip; -&gt; misery.</li>
<li>Suppose you do not have a desire, demand on god or world. Then supreme joy will come and engulf you. Desireless is godliness. Seek and desire nothing. When you&rsquo;re desireless you&rsquo;re spontaneously happy.</li>
<li>Karmas are performed so the results can be enjoyed by the body. Yet the body doesn&rsquo;t belong to you. It can break to pieces any time. It&rsquo;s food for other creatures. Or it becomes ashes, or tomato (-&gt; body -&gt; tomato).</li>
<li><strong>Hrdaya grantih (knot). If grantih in the body - cancer. If in the mind - desire.</strong> Desire and fear - struggle -&gt; clash, conflict as somebody else strives for the same things as well.</li>
<li>When you believe something &ldquo;is mine&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll suffer. There is no &ldquo;my wife/husband&rdquo;. There is only body&rsquo;s wife/husband. Between I and the object there is one more intermediate thing - the body. Same for everything &hellip;</li>
<li>Nothing wrong with the language (saying &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;my&rdquo;), the sense of mine is the problem.</li>
<li>Riches and self-aggrandizement make the people insensitive.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-hari--stress-meditation">4: Hari &amp; stress; meditation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Not always necessary to give a name. A number might be enough for the purpose of communication.</li>
<li><strong>World doesn&rsquo;t bind you. Wherever you have an ID, you&rsquo;ve bound yourself.</strong></li>
<li>People easily forget that the names of god are names given to Nameless Reality. And that every name is a significant name. Names are different, the reality (vastu) is the same.</li>
<li>Hari is a significant name. harati iti hari.</li>
<li><strong>Stress is produced by thought. Just a thought produces stress.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The more and more you connect yourself to the world, the more you&rsquo;re stressed out.</strong> Withdraw the mind from the world.</li>
<li>Pure mind = calm and quit mind.</li>
<li><strong>You need to work in the world, that&rsquo;s enough. You need not think about the world. You need not contemplate about the world. Conserve the mental energy. Use the energy on contemplating on Isvara.</strong> -&gt; all the stress, sorrow, afflictions will get neutralised. Like snow exposed to sun&rsquo;s rays. That&rsquo;s why Isvara is called Hari.</li>
<li>Hari = Hara.</li>
<li>Heart, pure Buddhi is the Vaikuntha. Contemplate on him in whatever way you can do it. You&rsquo;re not going to know Isvara entirely, he&rsquo;s infinite. Mind cannot grasp the infinite, it&rsquo;s impossible to grasp of him completely. What you can do is enough. And mind becomes pure.</li>
<li>Isvara abides in all lifeforms in their hearts. Meditation: visualize Isvara, whatever you know about him, in your heart. Then in the hearts in friends, foes, animals, &hellip; all living beings. Learn to look at people not from the perspective of a divisive idea but from all-pervading Isvara.</li>
<li>Mind runs away into the wasteful lands of the worldliness. Bring back the mind and put it on the truth.</li>
<li>A believer and a non-believer go to a temple. The believer sees Isvara due to Isvara in his heart. The non-believer sees an idol. It&rsquo;s not that because there is Isvara in the temple you&rsquo;ll see him there.</li>
<li>Once you see Isvara in your heart you&rsquo;ll see Isvara in every particle of this universe.</li>
<li>Kids - don&rsquo;t have discrimination. Asura balaka - wordly people.</li>
<li>My mind has weaknesses, other persons mind has mistakes. Learn to make others happy, to respect them, to treat them well. They&rsquo;re all the image of Isvara.</li>
<li>Grow into the devotion. Make it happen. It won&rsquo;t happen by itself.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5-rose-and-love-trust-in-isvara-being-nobody-love-vs-attachment">5: rose and love; trust in Isvara; being nobody; love vs. attachment</h1>
<ul>
<li>Isvara is present in the heart as the presence. Not as who or what.</li>
<li>No definition needed. <strong>Rose - whosoever comes close gets the fragrance. I - whosoever comes close gets love.</strong></li>
<li>Atmosphere in the jail is different but the space is not. Isvara is in the heart in the heart of the criminal just as in the heart of the saint.</li>
<li>Love = silence = being = Isvara. Get centered in the inner silence and love becomes spontaneous. Love of the ego/mind is reaction. It becomes hate later. It is not about the person, it is about the metamorphosis of the mind later.</li>
<li><strong>There is no me/mine in that silence/love.</strong></li>
<li>Saka - your best friend. Always with you. Jiva and Isvara bird are never separated. Jiva is always part of Isvara.</li>
<li>Sickness is creation of the mind. It doesn&rsquo;t begin with the body but with the mind. Wearing out is a must with the body. It is the mind that says that it should not wear out and function all the time the same therefore I call it sickness.</li>
<li>In case the body gets ill do what it takes, still the best support is Isvara. Just endure. Sickness, medicine, result &hellip; is Isvara. Trust in Isvara fully.</li>
<li>If you accumulate all the things and fail to have unconditional trust in Isvara, they won&rsquo;t help you. If you have the trust, what are they good for?</li>
<li>Conditioned mind - pre-opinionated.</li>
<li>Artha and kama is like bubbles with short lifespan. Kids are enjoying soap bubbles, their intelligence is not enough to understand deeper things. That&rsquo;s why they are amusing themselves with bubbles. Are the elders any different? Even as the colorful bubble is created it is going. It won&rsquo;t stay. It will perish.</li>
<li>Like a cat closing eyes trying to drink the milk it should be not. We do not pay attention to the ephemeral nature of the things. Law of the casino: only the house wins.</li>
<li>Securities. The moment we remember them we become insecure.</li>
<li>Secret of attachment: deep rooted belief - with this wealth, I&rsquo;m somebody. Without it I&rsquo;m nobody. People do not like to be a nobody. It is just imagination. <strong>The day you love to be a nobody you&rsquo;re liberated.</strong></li>
<li>Security - you&rsquo;ve got a piece of paper and the wealth sits with somebody else.</li>
<li><strong>Life is a travel in the ship. Samsara is samudra (ocean). Body is the ship. There will be shipwreck and then your wealth will pull you down.</strong></li>
<li>All this is meant for dispassion, not to make you sad.</li>
<li>Prana - breath going in (brana?). It is not yours, it belongs to the whole. Do you really think you own land? Land is always land, people come and people go. There is no question of owning anything.</li>
<li><strong>Swami TV: I love to be nobody. I love to be in the audience, not on the stage (unless I have to). You&rsquo;re not counted when you&rsquo;re the audience. On the stage you become somebody - attached to name and fame.</strong></li>
<li>Richman - one who is giving away things that come to him all the time. Accumulation - poor man w. vacuum in his heart.</li>
<li><strong>If the mold of the husband/wife is there I can love only conditionally (=attachment). Because the mold is there. There will be an agenda that goes with the image.</strong> If the other fulfills the agenda, I love him/her&hellip;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t look at the other as wife. Look at her as she is. If you don&rsquo;t give importance to the image, you won&rsquo;t give importance to the agenda.</li>
<li>Be devoted to the individual, not to the image. True love will blossom. In true love there is no demand. Only giving. Not taking. If you seek, that is not pure love, that is attachment.</li>
<li>Love and sentimentality are different.</li>
<li>It is regrettable that most of us desire to shape the child that it gratifies our own vanity. This is attachment. Same for owning/dominating the children. Telling them what they should think. Rather tell them how to think.</li>
<li>Khalil Gibran: <em>Your children are not your children, they are Life&rsquo;s (cosmic life - Hiranyagarbha) longing for itself. They come through you, but not from you. Though they are with you, yet they don&rsquo;t belong with you. You might give them your love, but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies, but not their souls. For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you, for life goes not backwards, nor terries with yesterday. You&rsquo;re the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent for. The Archer sees the mark on the park of the infinite. And bends you with His might that his arrows might go swift and far. Let your bending in the Archer&rsquo;s hand be for gladness for even as he loves the arrows that flies so he also loves the bow that is stable.</em></li>
<li>We are people of agenda in all relationships. We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s pure love. When there is no attachment, love will blossom.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="6-ananda-vs-sukha-dukha-centered-in-the-center">6: ananda vs sukha dukha; centered in the center</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ananda is different from sukha. Sukha translated as pleasure has an opposite - pain. Opposites always go together.</li>
<li>While the day is going on the night is getting ready. There is no abrupt change (black/white). You can never have one separate with the other. Even as you are enjoying pleasure you are creating pain. Hang-over effect.</li>
<li>Decide whether you want timeless ananda or sukha-dukha. <strong>Pain and pleasure are states of mind. During both the mind is turbulence (once up and once down). Stress created by hyperactivity of the mind doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between pleasure and pain.</strong></li>
<li>There is no wisdom, no pragmatism in seeking pleasure. It is just as painful as any pain. Go for on objects (of the world) independent ananda. It is yourself.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t even try to be happy because you&rsquo;re the happiness. If you do try, the effort = misery. Parable: sugar crystal trying to get sweet. In an effort to become happy you move from yourself and thus lose all happiness.</li>
<li>Be in the silence of the love = Shanti, Brahman, Iswara, prema &hellip;</li>
<li>Secret of mahatmas good health is that their mind is mostly silent. They are not seeking any pleasures and thus abide in their svarupa. <strong>Their mind is thus pure (=silent, calm).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stop seeking pleasures of this world all-together. Avoid any effort to be happy.</strong> Just be. Happiness that comes by any effort is misery.</li>
<li><strong>Pleasures makes us servile.</strong> As we cling to the things of the world - there is only trouble. No trouble means clinging to nothing. Give up all to gain all. Life becomes pure radiation of inner joy from an inexhaustible source of love and happiness. And the [world will appear like a dream (like the moon during daytime)]({% post_url 2019-09-14-Zorba_the_Greek %}).</li>
<li>The dream is not the problem, your desire to cling to it is. You have to stop imagining that this dream is real, that this dream is yours. Look at the dream as dream, refuse to give reality to it.</li>
<li>Understand the utter folly in worldly and ritualistic actions aimed at fulfilling desires. Of having a blueprint (for happiness). <strong>Suppose you don&rsquo;t desire nothing you will not know what is trouble.</strong> Will generate fear in you and that makes you a slave of transient things.</li>
<li>All fear we have is due to the sense of insufficiency. You&rsquo;ve to know you&rsquo;re the infinite ocean of bliss. <strong>Get some viveka. You lack nothing. I don&rsquo;t want any change to happen in what I&rsquo;m now or in what I&rsquo;ve now.</strong></li>
<li>You should not look at yourself as mere deha. Deha is healthy, not I&rsquo;m healthy. Be careful even in the language not to identify with the body. 1) disidentify literally 2) disidentify emotionally, intellectually.</li>
<li>Falsehood makes you suffer, never the Truth.</li>
<li>Asmin dehe (in this body), I&rsquo;m the dehi - the embodied. They belong to different orders of realities. The reflexion of the moon in the water is moving, but not the moon! <strong>Body/mind is functioning (doing, thinking) but you remain changeless being</strong>, the center, the source.</li>
<li>You know the atma by being the atma. Discover it and remain there and you discover your center in being. And then you develop a nag in remaining there even in acting. Start in small steps, like washing the dishes, the hands, taking a walk. First fix yourself in the being and then there is the movements of the hands, walking but you remain fixed in the being. This way you discover there is doing but I&rsquo;m not the doer.</li>
<li>People confuse thinking with being. Degree is intellect, not your being. Accomplishment (=action) is not your being. Your body is not your being.</li>
<li>Only rich people grow grass and cut it. Ordinary people have no time for that.</li>
<li>One is doer, one is body only by aviveka.</li>
<li>Dharma (here): merit you want to derive to gain heaven etc (heavenly currency). Give up the three: artha, kama, dharma. Once they are put aside there is no desire left.</li>
<li>Spontaneity of love: not needing anything and worshipping Isvara, not knowing what is the purpose. I.e. desireless worship. Then you&rsquo;ve reached the goal. Because the moment you see &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, &ldquo;result&rdquo;, &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; is always mind-made. The moment you say purpose you&rsquo;re engrossed in the movement of the mind. <strong>Anything the mind wants has no value. Mind cannot conceive the real. Whatever it conceives/wants is not real.</strong></li>
<li>Water, sun, wind, earth, mountains, roses &hellip; don&rsquo;t seek a purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Desire comes. If you are interested in it it will bind you. If not it will just go.</strong></li>
<li>Parable: king going to London. 1st wife wants diamonds, 2nd wants clothes. 3rd &ldquo;I want you&rdquo;. Worship Isvara like that and you&rsquo;ll discover him as the atma.</li>
<li>Whatever appears at the very first glance is not the truth. Like sun rising. Seeing differences (nama &amp; rupa). Yet human consciousness is the same - fundamentally insecure and unsatisfied. Always look for the unity. One tree is growing because there is life in it. A different tree is growing because there is life in it. Yet it is the same life in every living being. That one life without the other is God, Atma, Isvara.</li>
<li>Legs - prthvivi, abdomen - water, tummy - fire, chest - vayu, neck and above - akasha. Mahabhuta - because they are everywhere. Entire universe is pervaded by them and they put the body in place, in which the atma houses. Because all bodies are made in the same way we can have medical science.</li>
<li>Stop identifying with the body and hold on to the hari and you&rsquo;ll not know what is sorrow in life.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="7-one-reality-sharanagatih-love">7: one reality, sharanagatih, love</h1>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re that divinity that you worship. Realising Isvara and realising one&rsquo;s true essence is one and the same.</li>
<li>Adhiyatma (individual - jiva), adhibhuta (world - jagat), adhidaiva (god - isvara) are <strong>not three different realities, but thee different aspects of one reality</strong>. Brahman being looked at though different conditionings.</li>
<li>What is your vision about yourself will determine your vision about gods and the world. If you are conflicted within you&rsquo;ll see conflict everywhere. There is so much love, peace in the world -&gt; there is so much love in your heart, peace.</li>
<li>Jiva is brahman, the supreme reality, reflecting in body mind + ignorance. Remove the ignorance and jiva alone will shine as Brahman. Pure crystal with different objects before - it gets &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; by them.</li>
<li>People addicted to names will not know the truth. Vicious circle: one name leads to another and so on &hellip; <strong>When food is served, you don&rsquo;t name any dish. All you likes and dislikes about food they fall apart.</strong></li>
<li>The name binds you. Remove the name, remove the form and the reality shines forth. 12:00 - small needle merges in big needle. In the fullness of jnanam (12:00) the individual and godhead merge.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m - sense of being. Knowing that I&rsquo;m (not knowledge, book stuff). I&rsquo;m-ness limited in space and time is jiva. Pure I&rsquo;m-ness is brahman. Take brahman and put some limitations on it and you&rsquo;ve got a jiva. How? Maya (magic)&hellip;</li>
<li>Individual and universe: Looking at the absolute brahman through the prism of space, time and causation -&gt; limitation.</li>
<li>In absolute there is no time. Thought is encased in time. Time is a category of thought. In the absolute there is also no motion. Because there is no other. Absolute is one without the second. Motion is movement of an object in reference to some other point. Causation begins only when the absolute is degenerated into the multitudinous universe. Don&rsquo;t look at your self through the prism of space-time-causation or else you become the &ldquo;caused&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMquExt5-M">Saranagatih</a> - allow Isvara to decide what is good for you. I surrender myself to Isvara. Whether I should marry or not, &hellip;, Ishvara shall decide. Motiveless devotion.</strong></li>
<li>Shankara: All devatas (angels) and asuras (daemons) are among humans only. Devatas - Hollywood stars. Asuras - suited people. Yaksha - finance people. Gandharva - dance and music people. Supreme Gandharva was Michael Jackson.</li>
<li>Shaking hands vs. touching feet of a Guru: feet, because presiding deity for feet is Vishnu. For hands it is Indra.</li>
<li>Touching feet or being devoted to the lotus feet of the lord means surrender - sharanagatih. Allow God into your (thought) life and then let go. Give up all concern. Accept what is and then maybe do something about it. But first accept so you can do effectively.</li>
<li>Resolution for the new year: We&rsquo;re surrendering to to Isvara&rsquo;s glory, and we do anticipate anything. We do not get concern about anything. We are letting go and accepting things as they come. -&gt; You&rsquo;ll not know what is insecurity and fear.</li>
<li>Swami TV: I suppose dvija-tvam (bar mitzvah, born again from Christianity) came by silk-route.</li>
<li>Surrender to Isvara doesn&rsquo;t make any demands. People can be in any state/stage of life. No qualification is required.</li>
<li>Blemish in loving is desire. In love there is no desire (demand, expectation) involved. Then it is pure love.</li>
<li>Love - supreme power that makes the life free from conflict. Any other power cannot solve any conflict.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t cut the rose&rdquo;. Stop purchasing 12 roses for 9.99 and the other will stop cutting. It&rsquo;s a vicious circle.</li>
<li>Loving insentient object - moha. Different as seeing it as the glory of Isvara. Swami TV: I love leaves falling down not knowing where they fall. I love all lifeforms. <strong>I love every particle of this universe. There is not what for.</strong></li>
<li>When you know you love Isvara yet you know not why you love Isvara then moksha is yours. Then you don&rsquo;t need anything else.</li>
<li>Yogi - seeker, striver, devote, jnani.</li>
<li>When you rejoice people in happiness, when you feel sad when you feel people becoming sad - you&rsquo;re a jogi. All sense of division are kept aside. Supreme devotion.</li>
<li>There is not multiple selves. In fact there is only one self for every lifeform. And that self is Isvara. True devotion is love of that Isvara - sarvaatma.</li>
<li><strong>Vivekananda: Selflessness is the best way to secure what is good for you.</strong> People are selfish because they want the best things for them for the sake of their happiness.</li>
<li><strong>The only way to become happy is to give happiness to others. The moment you seek happiness for yourself you become miserable</strong>.</li>
<li>ekAnta (one end) bhakti: the means and the goal is one and the same. Love of Isvara for gaining Isvara.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="8-daityas-morality-isvara">8: daityas; morality; Isvara</h1>
<ul>
<li>Prahlada&rsquo;s mind (buddhi) was firmy established (ekanta samsthitam) in Isvara.</li>
<li>Single important cause of unhappiness of old people - body becomes old yet the mind is just as active as it used to be, not having any peace. -&gt; comparison -&gt; jealousy manifested by complaints, remembering and glorifying the past.</li>
<li>Goal of life: knowing oneself. Knowing what you are before the body falls. Is the same as motiveless devotion to Isvara. Bhakti = jnanam. Prahlada&rsquo;s mind is set on this goal.</li>
<li>Diti is dvaityam, duality. Adity - non-duality. Children of Adity are devatas - wise people. Children of Diti are asuras - worldly, arrogant, big ego.</li>
<li>sa:vega = momentum. sa:kopavega - momentum of anger. kamavega or kamavesha. Entire physiology gets affected. Outwardly and inwardly. It is like a daemon has possessed the guy. There is an asura sitting in everybody.</li>
<li><strong>Prahlada is not even trying to defend himself. If you react the other finds justification for his anger, but if you do not react and just accept it with love, with smile</strong>, the other won&rsquo;t find justification for this anger. Acceptance - that is how a Jnani is. He can just smile.</li>
<li>People feel hurt - it shows they are ignorant. Then people justify their hurt. Pragmatical would be just to forgive&hellip;</li>
<li>(Petty tyrant) <strong>If somebody says something against you, it can be only against the ego once you identify with your mind. You can be happy about it and join with the other. Because ego is not yourself.</strong></li>
<li>Social morality wants you to be ambitious, competitive, progressive, easily hurt and reacting.  It wants you to pursue wealth, pleasures and family. Social morality has its origin in ignorance. <strong>Real morality - you&rsquo;re not competitive, you do not compare with others, you do not get hurt but are instead always loving and compassionate. You don&rsquo;t speak much. Society might look at such a person as a dumb guy.</strong></li>
<li>Follow the truth. If father, brother, husband &hellip; come in the way renounce them.</li>
<li>There is one power behind small and big, behind everything. There is no enemy because the same unknown universal power is behind all. It is the unknown power acting, you&rsquo;re imagining you&rsquo;re acting.</li>
<li>Arrogant person thinks he controls a lot, others might think they control a bit. In fact we&rsquo;re like patients under anesthetics when a surgeon is performing surgery on them. The patient has no power whatsoever. We just imagine. Everything happens to us. You don&rsquo;t have a choice. You&rsquo;ve got an illusion of a choice. In our folly we think we&rsquo;re accomplishing things.</li>
<li>Isvara is the power of time. Everything happens in time. (&ldquo;For everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven.&rdquo; - Ecclesiastes). He creates, protects and destroy. It is all the same power.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence - sattva power of Isvara. When you understand the structure of the atom that is the intelligence in the atom you&rsquo;ve understood.</strong></li>
<li>Once we&rsquo;re after pleasures any amount of wealth is not enough. When you&rsquo;re desiring you&rsquo;re bound to have enemies as others desire the same. That leads to anger -&gt; daemon. There are no friends and foes, there is only divinity. Yet people seek and imagine. Don&rsquo;t split yourself into the opposites. Establish yourself in the sameness (samatvam).</li>
<li>Conquer your body. Body says go sit on the couch, yet you say and sit straight. Body says, eat more, you say this is enough. Conquer your mind. If you don&rsquo;t that body and mind will become your enemies. Enemy = one who makes you uncomfortable, suffer and miserable.</li>
<li><strong>Past-time of the ignorant mind - divide and oppose.</strong></li>
<li>Great puja of infinite Isvara - samatvam (= greatest worship). Not having friends and foes.</li>
<li>Kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya - the six enemies are like termites in the heart. Eating up his vitals of life and wisdom, his peace of mind. The person is collecting and thinking I&rsquo;ve accomplished this and that&hellip; So think first of conquering your inner enemies.</li>
