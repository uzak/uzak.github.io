<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

<ul>
  <li>life of solitude - either through periodic retreats or continuing inner solitude in society - may be the best answer to cries that modern world is inevitably a “lonely crowd.”</li>
  <li>your lonely quietude may be bothered by demons of lust, vainglory, or melancholy. Your fears and vanities will follow you into solitude.</li>
  <li>The essential thing is to be apart from society for some time, physically, mentally, or spiritually.</li>
  <li>There is the simple joy of doing nothing, appreciating life away from the crowd.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overture">Overture</h2>

<h2 id="nietzsches-call">Nietzsche’s call</h2>
<ul>
  <li>like Heraclitus in the Temple of Artemis, the Buddha under his Bodhi Tree, or Thoreau at Walden Pond, Nietzsche felt and thought best an most deeply when alone.</li>
  <li>The deep quiet in which I live and grow against the world, and harvest what they cannot take from me by fire or sword.”</li>
  <li>every philosopher, says Nietzsche, is a hermit.</li>
  <li>You’re not really a Friend [of Solitude] unless you’ve either chosen isolation or, if it were thrust upon you, you came to appreciate its therapeutic, creative powers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="petrarchs-life-of-solitude">Petrarch’s Life of Solitude</h2>
<h3 id="the-apologia">The Apologia</h3>
<ul>
  <li>be still and see that I am God (Psalm 46)</li>
  <li>begin, in this life, to feel the delights of the life eternal.</li>
  <li>Among the great benefit of books, says Petrarch, is that they do not ask for food or drink and are content with a narrow portion of one’s house, yet they provide inestimable treasures of mind. In their authors, on has unfailing companions always prepared to be silent or to speak, to stay at home or to accompany him in the woods, to travel…</li>
  <li>isolation without literature is exile, prison, and torture; but supply literature, and it becomes your country, freedom and delight.</li>
  <li>Petrarch stresses, however, that <strong>his closest friend in solitude was his own reflective mind.</strong></li>
  <li>solitude can supply what he calls a “divine fertility of intellect”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="laura-and-a-writing-cure">Laura and a Writing Cure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>around the age of forty “I renounced abruptly not only those bad habits, but even the very recollection of them - as if I had never looked at a woman. This I consider to be among my greatest blessings, and I thank God,</li>
  <li>his love for Laura was all part of his spiritual education. At first, she had been his exquisite worldly torment; then a guiding light from heaven; finally, his salvation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="augustinus">Augustinus</h3>
<ul>
  <li>he admits that he is still tied to the miseries of the world by two “fetters of gold”. One is his love of Laura; the other is his desire for fame, as symbolized by the laurel wreath with which he was crowned poet laureate.</li>
  <li>earthly success may run counter to his heavenly goals, that he should put virtue before glory</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lady-solitude">Lady Solitude</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Solitude is indeed something holy, innocent, incorruptible, and the purest of human possessions. To whom does she reveal herself amid forests, for whom does she display her charms and thorns? … With whom, finally, does she ingratiate herself, who does she seek to please, except the person who has penetrated the inmost recesses of solitude and for whom therefore there is no solitude?</li>
  <li>Let the others be constantly in a state of restlessness and agitation, let us establish ourselves with feet firmly planted on the rock.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-brief-history">A Brief History</h2>
<ul>
  <li>But what vistas of mystical sensation, what luminous mental landscapes, what avenues of planetary reverie are opened up when one follows these voyagers through the void! – John Cowper Powys, A Philosophy of Solitude, 1933</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prehistoric-solitude">Prehistoric Solitude</h2>
<ul>
  <li>no one in the house understood him, and no one believed in him.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-power-in-caves">The Power in Caves</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of his teachers, Pherekydes, portrayed caves, or what he called hollows in the Chthoni (the “earth mother”), as receptacles of the divine hand of creation.</li>
  <li>the cave at the summit of the mountain signifies the most typical site of the divine epiphany, the place where, after a period of occultation, a redeeming god, a prophet, or a cosmocrator make his appearance.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="above-ground">Above Ground</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a shaman cannot become truly powerful until he is capable of “seeing the body as a skeleton” - in other words, contemplating the reality of death</li>
  <li>True wisdom is only to be found far away from people, out in the great solitude, and it is not found in play but only through suffering. solitude and suffering open the human mind, and therefore a shaman must seek his wisdom there.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solitary-initiation">solitary initiation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>having thereby feed himself of all vestiges of self, intellect, and other noisome worldly illusions, the neophyte should learn through psychodramatic experience that samsara (the material world of the senses) and nirvana (the transcendental void of the spirit) are one</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hermits-of-india">hermits of india</h2>
<ul>
  <li>munis, or “silent sages”</li>
  <li>“maddened with silence.”</li>
  <li>“we have mounted the wind! our bodies are all you mortals can see!”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="power-hermits">power hermits</h3>
<h3 id="eremitic-epidemic">eremitic epidemic</h3>
<h3 id="heterodox-hermits">heterodox hermits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>recluse may achieve “a state of joy and ease born of detachment”… at a still higher level of attainment, the recluse may “suppress all reasoning and investigation,” then “hold aloof from joy,” so as to enter a state of “attentive equanimity.” finally, he may give up happiness and sadness completely to enter “a state of pure mindfulness and equanimity beyond both pain and pleasure.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compromise-sophistication">compromise, sophistication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>virtually al of them [howto guidebooks] begin with the same advice: “find a lonely spot.”</li>
  <li>if one is satisfied with living alone in an empty place, regarding the agents of defilement as bitter enemies, and content with his own company, then he may drink the “nectar of spiritual exultation” and enjoy “happiness greater than that of paradise.”</li>
  <li>redirection of passions to a higher degree of “pleasure” in immortality or god’s grace.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="greece-and-rome">greece and rome</h2>
<ul>
  <li>solitude - as an “end in itself” and the highest realization of the good life in the polis. “for contemplation,” says artistotle, is “the highest form of activity, since the intellect is the highest thing in us, and the objects that it apprehends are the highest things that can be known.”</li>
  <li>after Narcissus died, according to Ovid, he was transformed into a beautiful spring flower.</li>
  <li>Pythagoras “sought out not only agreeable seclusion but even vast and frightful wildernesses, and often went on toilsome journeys in deserted regions in his zeal for investigating the truth.”</li>
  <li>Democritus, was so enamored of solitude that he “tore out his eyes in order to see the truth and avoid seeing the mob, which is the enemy of truth.”</li>
  <li>Abaris … lived without food, and traveled all over the world as a wandering missionary like Aristeas bearing a golden arrow, symbol of the god Apollo.</li>
  <li>the goddess of “avenging Justice” welcomed him graciously and taught him the marks of true Being, the immortal essence of all things. As important, she taught him the method of correct thinking - that is, logic. The dialogue marks the first appearance of logical argument in Greek philosophy. Using that powerful tool, the goddess explains that Being must be the only entity that exists, because it is the only thing that did not “come into being.” For if Being came into being in the past or will do so in the future, then “it is not.” But since Being does exist, says the goddess, it must be “unborn and imperishable, whole, unique, immovable, and without end.” She even asserted that Being has a shape: “It is complete on every side, like the mass of a well-rounded sphere.”</li>
  <li>one may rise on the wings of Eros through several interrelated stages toward a kind of enlightenment: first, by directing one’s love to other bodies; then by transforming that love into a meditation on the “beauty in souls”; then by turning one’s mind to “the great ocean of beauty, and in contemplation of it give birth to many beautiful and magnificent speeches and thoughts in the abundance of philosophy.” Finally, at the highest level, one may contemplate “being by itself always in simplicity.” “Therein,” said Diotima, “is life worth living.” For he who comprehends “Beauty itself” will be “the friend of God, and immortal if any man ever is.”</li>
  <li>both Parmenides and Socrates imply that the way to understanding the transcendent world of Being or the imminent worlds of Truth and Beauty is through a mental journey of some kind.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heraclitus">Heraclitus</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Without tension and change there would be nothing, and no self-understanding. As to what is the ultimate nature of Nature, Heraclitus warns that we will never know - “so deep is the logos.”</li>
  <li>One should, in other words, steer clear of the watery element (drunkenness, weepy passions, the mob) and face the truths of existence squarely, without the supporting hope of a loving divinity.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lonely-pleasure">Lonely Pleasure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The objective of moderation and “the end of all action,” says Democritus, is euthymia, which may be translated as “cheerfulness,” “well-being,” or “contentment.” … equanimity, tranquillity, and a wise retirement from social turmoil.</li>
  <li>The man who wishes to have serenity of spirit should not engage in many activities, either private or public, nor choose activities beyond his power and natural capacity. He must guard against this, so that when good fortune strikes him and leads him on to excess by means of (false) seeming, he must rate it low, and not attempt things beyond his powers. A reasonable fullness is better than overfullness.</li>
  <li>Democritus maintained that contentment will grow as one is satisfied with less</li>
  <li>his emphasis on pleasure was the opposite of self-indulgence or libertinism, for he viewed it not as excess, but as the absence of pain and anxiety.</li>
  <li>“<strong>Withdrawal into obscurity is the best form of security.</strong>”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roman-retirement">Roman Retirement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“I’m alive, royally alive, when free of all you adore and rise up as high as heaven,”</li>
  <li>“You ask me to say what you should consider it particularly important to avoid. My answer is this:” he wrote to the young Lucillius, “a mass crowd.”</li>
  <li>The wise man is content with himself</li>
  <li><strong>The supreme ideal does not call for any external aids. It is home-grown, wholly self-developed. Once it starts looking for outside itself or any part of itself it is on the way to being dominated by the fortune</strong>.</li>
  <li>Men seek seclusion in the wilderness, by the seashore, or in the mountains - a dream you have cherished for yourself. But such fancies are wholly unworthy of a philosopher, since at any moment you choose you can retire within yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="otherwordly-directions">Otherwordly Directions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Philo’s man of virtue does not love solitude out of misanthropy. He is rather a lover of men who spends his time in an out-of-the-way place to avoid the vices of the multitude.</li>
  <li>“alone with the Alone”</li>
  <li>cut away all that is excessive, straighten all that is crooked, bring light to all that is overcast, labor to make all one glow of beauty and never cease chiseling your statue until there shall shine from it the godlike splendor of virtue, until you shall see the perfect Goodness established in the stainless shrine.</li>
  <li>to rise through mystic contemplation above the pains and flaws of this world to an ideal world of perfection, where “the essential man outgrows Being, becomes identical with the Transcendent Being.”</li>
  <li>“image to archetype.”</li>
  <li>This is the life of the gods and of godlike and blessed men, - liberation from the alien that besets us here, a life taking no pleasure in the things of earth - a flight of the alone to the Alone.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ancient-china">Ancient China</h2>
<ul>
  <li>history of solitude in China is one of balance and worldly practicality.</li>
  <li>Stop your thinking, he said. Destroy your concepts. think without “thinking.” The text reads: Let there be no seeing, no hearing; enfold the spirit in quietude and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure, do not labour your body, do not churn up your essence… When the eye does not see, the ear does not hear, end the mind does not know, then your spirit will protect the body and the body will enjoy long life.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-best-men">The “Best Men”</h3>
<ul>
  <li>shih ritual, in which an adept would make himself or herself as quiet as a corpse in order to communicate with the dead.</li>
  <li>“Do not stay in a state which is in disorder. When the empire possesses the Way, be seen. When the empire does not possess the Way, hide.”</li>
  <li>Don’t escort the big chariot; You will only make yourself dusty. Don’t think about the sorrows of the world; You will only make yourself wretched.</li>
  <li>If only my mind can be beautiful, it matters nothing that I often faint for famine.”</li>
  <li>Keep your soul from confusion, and it will come naturally,” says Wang: Await in emptiness, before even inaction. All other things proceed from this…</li>
  <li>When I looked, my startled eyes saw nothing. When I listened, no sound met my amazed ear. Transcending Inaction, I came to Purity, and entered the neighborhood of the Great Beginning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="taoist-philosophers">Taoist Philosophers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“It is ever so that the essence of things is what gives them life.” That essence - the Tao - is silent, compact, and obscure, which no fixed place. The supreme quality for men, therefore is also quiescence.</li>
  <li>If quiescent, you will then obtain it. If hasty, you will then lose it.</li>
  <li>A noble person with sufficient inner virtue may give the appearance of a fool. Therefore, give up your high-handed manner, your desires, your vanity, and your zeal - for they are no use to you.</li>
  <li>“When you have little, you’ll attain much,” he wrote. “With much, you’ll be confused.”</li>
  <li>The secret lies with understanding - or, more precisely, feeling, absorbing, and living in “the true essence of things.”</li>
  <li>tales that do not over-explain but rather point the way to freedom, happiness, and perfection in unexpected quarters.</li>
  <li>The first step, she explains, is to put the world outside of your-self… then to put things outside of yourself… then to put life outside of yourself, at which point you will be able to achieve the “brightness of dawn” and to “see your aloneness.” At that point, she says, one can “do away with past and present” and “enter a place where there is no life or death.”</li>
  <li>not only to withdraw for a time from society but literally to isolate oneself from oneself - from all the excess baggage of one’s painful memories, rigid habits, and learned feelings.</li>
  <li>“You have too many policies and plans and you haven’t seen what is needed… You are still making mind your teacher.” Instead, you must fast!”</li>
  <li>Listening stops with the ears, the mind stops with recognition, but the spirit is empty and waits on all things. The way gathers in emptiness alone…</li>
  <li>the ancient Chinese hermits advocates a kind of worldly mysticism… they were somehow less ashamed of the body and more optimistic about prospects of being happy in the world.</li>
  <li><strong>be more like Emperor Yao, who neither possessed men nor allowed himself to be possessed by them.</strong> “So I ask you,” says the Master, “to rid yourself of hardship, to cast off your cares, and to wander alone with the Way to the Land of Great Silence.”</li>

  <li>If you cannot attain stillness where you now live, consider living in exile…</li>
  <li>The proof of having achieved a state of apatheia will come, says Evagrius, “when the spirit begins to see its own light, when it remains in a state of tranquility in the presence of images it has during sleep and when it maintains its calm as it beholds the affairs of life”.</li>

<h2 id="sufi-soloist">Sufi Soloist</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do you ever fear solitude? If you had tasted the delight of solitude, you would long for it, away from your self. Solitude is the beginning of the worship of God. What is the first thing you find in solitude? Peace far away from human intercourse and safety far from the evils which accompany it. When may the servant taste the bliss of intimacy with God? When his love for God becomes pure and he communes with him with a sincere heart. When is his love pure? When all his desires are concentrated in one: to obey God.</li>
  <li>“If you are capable of erecting an iron wall between yourself and your desires, then do it”</li>
  <li>“the people are the wild beasts of God on the earth. They show no affection for any human being.”</li>
  <li>serving God through asceticism - that is like breathing vinegar and mustard. Possessing divine knowledge - that is like scent of musk and ambergris.</li>

  <li>Renounce desire a hundred times or else not once will you embrace your desire.</li>
  <li>The wine we really drink is our own blood. Our bodies ferment in these barrels. We give everything for a glass of this. We give our minds for a sip.</li>
  <li>Externally he is congenial with everyone. Inwardly, he is a stranger to all. He is at peace with all people, yet within himself tranquillity is to be found only in Divine Love.</li>

  <li>“The phenomenal is the Bridge to the Real,”</li>
  <li>one must rise above all things worldly, including asceticism and preprogrammed concepts of Heaven.

  <li>Quaker meetings, which begin in silence and remain so until any one of the attendees is moved to speak.</li>
  <li>Rather than believing that religious contemplation might help to foster spiritual life, the Protestant, says Weber, places greater emphasis on a belief that selfless, worldly industry is the way to achieve God’s grace.</li>
  <li>the religious valuation of restless, continuous, systematic work became “the surest and most evident proof of rebirth and genuine faith.”</li>
  <li>the ascetic discipline of the monk and the hermit - the self-denial, the submission to authority, the dedicated industriousness for a greater good - was transformed into the worldly asceticism that is now the foundation of that most successful of modern institutions: the corporation. We might better term it the “capitalist monastery.”</li>

  <li>The intrepid philosopher may indeed be exploring the depths of his soul, but he is missing the most profound adventure - that is, climbing a real spiritual ladder to God.</li>
  <li>True solitude is found in humility, which is infinitely rich. False solitude is the refuge of pride, and it is indefinitely poor. The poverty of false solitude comes from an illusion which pretends, by adorning itself in things it can never possess, to distinguish one individual self from the mass of other men. True solitude is selfless.</li>
  <li>life of solitude will almost inevitably run afoul without the discipline and support to be found in a religious community.</li>

  <li>“but solitude is the school of genius”</li>
  <li>“I was never less alone than when by myself.”</li>
  <li>soon-to-be-world-historical figure withdraws into solitude at a certain troubled time in his life, and at a crucial turning point in the development, more commonly the disintegration, of his civilization. Alone, he rethinks the predicaments in which he finds himself. Then, in a mysterious action of the soul, he produces new seeds of thought that may be capable, at one extreme, of altering the growth pattern of the entire civilization, or at the other, of destroying genius in madness.</li>
  <li>“Willed introversion,” Cambell explains, “is one of the classic implements of creative genius.”</li>
  <li>Emptiness, stillness, limpidity, silence, inaction are the root of the ten thousand things.”</li>
  <li>“All the great nations have been prepared in privacy and in secret. They have been composed far away from distraction.”</li>
  <li>being alone for a while can add depth, clarity, and perspective to thought that might otherwise be drowned out in the clamor of social life. As an added benefit, quiet mediation may be therapeutic. Or it may be charged with inspiration, divine or otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="economics-of-solitude">Economics of Solitude</h3>
<ul>
  <li>it is in solitude - perhaps only in solitude - that one may learn to become truly social.</li>
  <li>“solitude is necessary for society as silence is for language and air for the lungs and food for the body.”</li>
  <li>only someone who is ready for anything, doesn’t exclude any experience, even the most incomprehensible, will live the relationship with another person as something alive and will himself sound the depths of his own being.</li>
  <li>hermits make the best lovers, in both the spiritual and physical senses.</li>
  <li>Much of that time would be better spent going for a walk, admiring landscape, digging our gardens, or on “science and art; not to impress somebody, but for love of beauty that each discloses.” We could even be quit occasionally, he adds: Better than such discourse doth silence <strong>long, long barren silence square with my desire.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compromise">Compromise</h3>
<ul>
  <li>do not argue against such things as friendship and simple enjoyment of life, but rather for greater balance between the life of solitude and that of society.</li>
  <li>“start cultivating a relationship with poverty” by appointing certain days on which he gives up everything and makes himself at home with next to nothing. “At the end of it, believe me,” he says, “you will revel in being sated for a penny, and will come to see that security from care is not dependent on fortune - for even when she is angry she will always let us have what is enough.”</li>
  <li>only through complete isolation and dedication to the infinite do we have any hope of achieving enlightenment. All other solitudes, says Merton, are false.</li>
  <li>Enlightenment or grace may come in away we cannot fathom in advance. So again, in the meantime, let us try to enjoy, understand, and live life in the world as it is - and let us do so in periods of solitude which will quicken our sensibilities and possible lead us to subtle answers to the unanswered questions.</li>

After days of fasting in solitude, the young Ojibwa initiate discovered the secrets of how to grow corn and thereby save his tribe. Buddha achieved enlightenment only after many years in ascetic solitude, when he looked like a skeleton with skin. And Saint John of the Cross made a point of saying that it was the “Dark Night” of his suffering in solitude that led to his unfathomable nearness with God.</li>

  <li>If we are to be truly happy and fulfilled, to understand the rhyme and reason for All, or enter the tavern of ruin, then stronger medicine, more perseverance, and a jarring life experience may be required.

  <li>Secluded meditation guards him who meditates, lengthens his life, gives him strength, and shuts out faults; it removes ill-fame, and leads to good repute, it drives out discontent, and makes for contentment, it removes fear and gives confidence, it removes sloth and gives vigor, it removes greed, hate, and delusion; it slays pride, breaks up preoccupations, makes thought one-pointed, softens the mind, generates gladness, makes one venerable, gives rise to much profit, makes one worthy of homage, brings exuberant joy, causes delight, shows the own-being of all conditioned things.</li>
  <li>what Patanjali emphasizes is the highest attainment of the yogi, who should finally renounce the siddhis and rise to the “infinite knowledge” and final liberation of the Self, which he calls the “Rain-Cloud of Divinity.”</li>

<h3 id="search-for-consistencies">Search for Consistencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>the fruits of solitude are remarkably consistent across time and culture, there is little consistency in the outward circumstances of the Friends’ eremitism.</li>
  <li>Simplicity of life - and, at higher strength, poverty and asceticism - seem naturally to be associated with the life of solitude.</li>
  <li>Diogenes Laertius, he was once spotted laughing to himself in a lonely spot. When asked why he took such pleasure when alone, he uttered this famous reply: “That is just the reason!”</li>
  <li>bitterness of mind should be “avoided like a plague.”</li>
  <li>education seems to have provided a discipline of thought that enabled them to get busy with creative output in time alone.</li>
  <li>Consciousness has never functioned in the manner of a conventional computer, which allows some processing to go on entirely separately from all other processing in the same machine. Instead, we are constantly distracted by the social noise of daily affairs, along with the internal residue of society in the form of memories, regrets, desires, and habits.</li>

  <li>Solitude leads the mind to those sources from whence the grandest conceptions are most likely to flow.</li>
  <li>“for by reason of the disturbance caused by this affair of the world he cannot see his sins, but if he lives in the peace and quietness of the desert he is able to see God clearly.”</li>
  <li>By “fasting,” he does not mean simply a restriction of diet, nor merely intense concentration alone. He advocates, rather, a complete emptying of the normal self, with its excess baggage of fears and habitual beliefs</li>
  <li>world’s greatest, most creative thinkers - he mentions recent ones, from Descartes to Wittgenstein - lived alone for most of their lives. Storr reasons that creation begins, in its first stage, with preparation, during which the creative person develops an interest in a particular subject, collects material, reads everything he can on the subject. Over time the accumulated material simmers in the mind. “We do not understand what goes on during this period of incubation,” Storr admits, “but it is a necessary prelude to the next stage, that of illumination.”</li>
  <li>dreams have an information-processing function, which is concerned with allotting new experiences to the right slot in permanent memory.</li>
  <li>In such a solitary, daydreaming state, the prepared mind, with its mysterious sorting process, may be better equipped for performing the essential and difficult creative task of “forming new links between formerly disparate entities.”</li>
  <li><strong>The best way to arrive at this state is through walking, forgetting, and a “cheerful imagination.” “Movement which does not come from outside then occurs inside us</strong>”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="passion">Passion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Nietzsche states explicitly that by avoiding the distracting effects of both physical and social intercourse, inner resources of passion can be used to boost intellectual powers.</li>
  <li>“the ‘higher phallus,’ with the head as the seat of creative realization.” Neumann explains that as consciousness develops in individuals it takes its impetus from innate animal instinct. That instinct, or libido, is required to make the ego strong enough to break away from the collective unconsciousness - that is, the collective transpersonal archetypes of the world, or what Neumann terms the “Earth Mother.” As the conscious ego develops sufficient autonomy, it then has a desire to use the same libidinal energy to reenter the mysterious Earth Mother. The result is enrichment of both consciousness and libido.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inner-resources">Inner Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The obvious problem with the source of creative energy is that human passions are very difficult to control</li>
  <li>“capacity to be alone” is something developed early in life.</li>
  <li>It also helps if one has something to be passionate about - a problem to be solved, discovery to be made, or a project to be completed - which will, in effect, distract one’s attention from the distractions of society.</li>

  <li>strategic moderation. “The truest happiness,” as the philosopher explains in his Letter to Menoecus, “does not come from enjoyment of physical pleasures, but from a simple life, free of anxiety, with the normal physical needs satisfied.”</li>
  <li>“We must not send our desires upon a distant quest, but we should permit them to have access to what is near, since they do not endure to be shut up altogether.”</li>
  <li>“cleaner conscience” is one of the greatest rewards of the secluded life. “In solitude,” he said, “one is removed from the object of the sin, from temptations as well as the influence of wrong-minded men.”</li>
  <li>When the mind is impressionable and has none too firm a hold on what is right, it must be rescued from the crowd: it is so easy for it to go over to the majority.</li>
  <li>there is a sense of well-being and physical and mental control that may be achieved by following a program of strenuous training - which, appropriately enough, is precisely the meaning of the Greek askesis, from which our word asceticism derives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defence-mechanisms">Defence Mechanisms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Buddha continues to recommend a balanced asceticism in the form of mendicancy and self control.</li>

<h3 id="detachment">Detachment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Plotinus likewise plotted the course to that immortal realm through a flight to the Primal Beauty of the Alone. “To attain it,” he says, “is for those that will take the upward path,” and enter the celebrations of the Mysteries laying aside garments, “in the nakedness, until passing on the upward way all that is other than God, each in the solitude of himself shall behold that solitary-dwelling Existence, the Apart, the Unmingled, the Pure.”</li>
  <li>“No soul can rest,” she said, “until it is detached from all creation.”</li>
  <li>wandering homelessness</li>
  <li>if you have nothing, you have nothing to lose; if you desire nothing you have everything to win.</li>
  <li>there is no hope of achieving a true and lasting happiness in the world as it appears to us viewed through the lens of desire.</li>
  <li>suicide is just another form of self-caring and desire. So truly to give up desire, one must give up desire for death, perhaps even desire for enlightenment, along with one’s incessant pessimism. As a second step, then, one may think: <strong>“Instead of isolating myself from the world, why not just give up the idea that I deserve or might win any further rewards from the world than the mysterious majesty of existence that already presents itself before me? What more do I want?”</strong> At that point, something miraculous seems to happen. For aside from all the philosophy and religious dogma that later come into play and quicken the process, optimism beings to grow, seemingly from nothing.</li>
  <li>If you abandon the affairs of the world, your body will be without toil. If you forget life, your vitality will be unimpaired.</li>
  <li>The transition from tenseness, self-responsibility, and worry, to equanimity, receptivity, and peace.</li>

  <li>It is literally eroticism, he writes, which gives chaste souls the energy or motivation to climb the spiritual ladder to God.</li>
  <li>“If they ask what Love is”, he says, “tell them it is the sacrifice of will. For if you have not left your will behind, you have no will at all.”</li>
  <li>Yes, to become lowly, lowlier still - as lowly as possible. This is the great secret of mystical life. And then, having reduced oneself to a single point and become nothing more than a soul and heart which loves, to get used to a complete reversal of the usual position - the eternal position of pride, and the uneasy position of the ego which always sees itself as the center of the universe.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughtless-philosophy">Thoughtless Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only when there is no pondering and no cognition will you get to know the Way. Only when you have no surroundings and follow no practices you will find the rest in the Way. Only when there is no path and no procedure can you get to the Way.</li>
  <li>to become a true bride of Christ one must not only become lost in a fierce tumult of love; the lonely contemplator must also have “lost himself in a Waylessness and in a Darkness, in which all contemplative men wander in fruition and wherein they never again can find themselves in a creaturely way.”</li>

  <li>gratitude for the majesty of existence.</li>
  <li>Youth are initiated into adulthood by “killing” their youthful ways, by being taken away from the protection of their mothers and families, and by being introduced forcefully to the great but also fearsome world outside the tribe where ancestors and good and evil spirits lurk. As Eliade puts it, the initiate “dies” to the temporal, profane world and is reborn into the world of the sacred, which is beyond time and the font of the group’s culture, spiritual values, and protections. The initiatory death, he says, “provides the clean slate on which will be written the successive revelations whose end is the formation of a new man.</li>
  <li>the neophyte should now be emancipated from all concepts, pious and impious.</li>
  <li>“We do not need philosophy to drive us to work. Necessity will do that,” he says. Rather, we need philosophy to “kill boredom, to destroy inertia, to dispel lethargy, to drive away weariness, to overcome a sense of futility.”</li>
  <li>We must philosophize with our malice. We must be as gods, selecting and rejecting. To accept the Cosmos in its entirety is the gesture of a slave not of a man.</li>

  <li>his penance, no matter how fervent, will do him little good until he cultivates an understanding of this own Soul, which is also the Soul of the universe.</li>
  <li>Incomprehensible is the supreme Soul, unlimited, unborn, unthinkable - His soul is space itself! In the dissolution of the world, He alone remains awake.</li>
  <li>Verily, freedom from desire is like the choicest extract from the choicest treasure. For a person who is made up of all desires, who has the marks of determination, conception, and self conceit, is bound. By being the opposite of that one is liberated.</li>
  <li>Enlightenment will only come, says Sakyanya, when “the intellect stirs not.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solitude-in-society">Solitude in Society</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Those who do well, do well wherever they are.</strong> – Meister Eckhard</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alienation">Alienation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>contemplation, which is essentially asocial, is a primary end of the zoon politikon.</li>
  <li>proliferation of computers that digitize our minds, nine-to-five jobs that so sap our spirit we never have time to come back to ourselves.</li>
  <li>Narcissism, he explains, “appears realistically to represent the best way of coping with the tensions and anxieties of modern life.</li>
  <li>In response, the narcissist may turn to the literature of self-help and what Lash terms “the ideology of personal growth.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-to-be-done">What Is to Be Done?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hegel’s basic point that alienation - in other words, solitude in society - is essential to individual human maturity and dignity.</li>
  <li>what matters is to increase men’s capacity to cope with alienation.</li>
  <li>it is only when we intentionally cultivate alienation and actively set the world outside ourselves once in a while that we will have a chance of seeing the world as it is.</li>
  <li>Without alienation from the world, they say, one cannot know God. The worst form of estrangement in society is not one’s separation from a warm, well-tempered community - but one’s isolation from the transcendent, all-powerful One, which is the only true reality.</li>
  <li>The state of existence is the state of estrangement… Man as he exists is not what he essentially is and ought to be. He is estranged from his true being.</li>
  <li>“In moments of solitude,” he writes in his essay Loneliness and Society, “something is done to us. The center of our being, the innermost self that is the ground of our aloneness, is elevated to the divine center and taken into it. Therein can we rest without losing ourselves.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deleting-loneliness">Deleting Loneliness</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I found many warnings that the sense of loneliness will continue to increase with changes in demographics, along with advances in technology and instant global communications.</li>
  <li>The first step is to choose solitude, to find a lonely spot, a place that you can love and where you might escape your tolls, troubles, and distractions. There, you might listen to your timeless self; sort things out; moderate desires, or ponder how best to redirect your life to something important and true, something that will fire your passion.</li>
  <li>Your worst fear, in addition to thoughts of death, is likely to be your fear of separation from the safety and nurturing warmth of society. But that is part of the adventure. Perhaps most important thing to remember is that separation is also freedom.</li>
  <li>If you lose yourself in waylessness, you may discover something wonderful there. You may not find the happiness you expect, but you may discover something larger that is beyond your expectations and for which, like all art, music, solo journeys of shamans, philosophy, and religion, words can spoil the meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inner-solitude">Inner Solitude</h2>
<ul>
  <li>it is possible and preferable to be solitary in a positive sense in society - simultaneously and continuously.</li>
  <li>he could evoke a solitude of mind no matter where he was. Even in the city</li>
  <li>mediate not on the ocean or starry heavens but on that which happens to be before me here and now.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="karma-yoga">Karma Yoga</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is not to relinquish worldly actions, but all attachment to the fruits of that action.</li>
  <li>wise men should act with detachment to preserve the world.</li>
  <li>he discovers joy in himself; joined by discipline to the infinite spirit, the self attains inexhaustible joy.</li>
  <li>Bhagavadgita advocates not so much saving the joys of time alone for latter half of life, but rather solitude in society, acceptance of fate, and responsibility in the world accompanied by spiritual innerness.</li>
  <li><strong>His nature is free of conditions, Win or lose, It makes no difference to him. Alone in the forest or out in the world, A god in heaven or a simple beggar, It makes no difference!</strong></li>
  <li>Never seek the solitude of the forest, Nor running from the crowd. Always and everywhere, He is one and the same.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="knight-of-the-faith">Knight of the Faith</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“thundering silence,”</li>
  <li>the way of the world and the way of the spirit should also be regarded as the same,</li>
  <li>action in the world of affairs with the tranquillity of inner retirement</li>
  <li>“<strong>The small hermit lives in the mountains. The great hermit lives in a town.</strong>”</li>
  <li>“The world is like a bride,” says al-Ghazali, “He who loves her combs and decorates her hair. The ascetic blackens her face, tears her hair out, and rends her clothes. But he who possesses the knowledge of God is completely absorbed in God and does not worry about her at all.”</li>
  <li>Westerners who do see the value and possibility of spiritual solitude in the world tend to be novelists, philosophers, or heretics.</li>
  <li>If he really has God and only God, then nothing disturbs him…</li>
  <li>One must learn an inner solitude, wherever or with whomsoever he may be. He must learn to penetrate things and find God there, to get a strong impression of God firmly fixed in his mind.</li>
