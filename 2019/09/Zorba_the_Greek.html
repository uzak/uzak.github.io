  <li>I went for it all. Wife, house, children. The full catastrophe.</li>
  <li>Life is trouble. To be alive is to undo your belt and look for trouble.</li>
  <li>Good or bad, what is the difference? They all end up the same way.</li>
  <li>
    <p>A man needs a little madness or else he never dares to cut the rope and be free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>“This is true happiness: to have no ambition and to work like a horse as if you had every ambition. To live far from men, not to need them and yet to love them. To have the stars above, the land to your left and the sea to your right and to realize of a sudden that in your heart, life has accomplished its final miracle: it has become a fairy tale.</li>
  <li>“If a woman sleeps alone it puts a shame on all men. God has a very big heart, but there is one sin He will not forgive. If a woman calls a man to her bed and he will not go.”</li>
  <li>“God changes his appearance every second. Blessed is the man who can recognize him in all his disguises.”</li>
