      <description>source notes from vedantastudents.com  Class 1: 1, 2  2nd chapter - Mahabhuta viveka. Between elements, elementals and Atma. This world, before it was created, was sat alone. sat eva somya idam agra asit ekam eva advitiyam (Chandogya). It is difficult to see the all-pervasivnes of consciousness and ananda because it gets not manifested everywhere. That&amp;rsquo;s why here sat that is obvious everywhere is discussed. Consciousness is the invariable factor in all the experiences of all the three states and therefore consciousness is sat and beyond time.</description>

01: Introduction  Like nobody can take your medicine, nobody but you can help you with moksha. Artha, kama, dharma one cat get through a proxy. Not moksha. First three can be attained by karma. Moksha only through jnanam. Everything in the three periods of time but you exists conditionally. Three obstacles: 1) lack of preparedness 2) obstacle pertaining to the interpretation of the sastra itself (different schools) 3) logical problems.</description>
