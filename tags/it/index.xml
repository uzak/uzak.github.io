Intro The easiest way to learn something is the hard way learn by doing avoid &amp;ldquo;tutorial hell&amp;rdquo; by watching school: goal of learning is good grade. Here to be able to write react code. Repetition is your best friend when it comes to learn something Don&amp;rsquo;t binge the course Your brain needs rest. Take breaks often. Re-watch past lessons. Esp. when stuck. Ask community on discord, if in doubt. First thing to learn: how to think in react?</description></item><item><title>AI and the Illusion of Intelligence</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2023-04-27-ai_and_the_illusion_of_intelligence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2023-04-27-ai_and_the_illusion_of_intelligence/</guid><description>src
Week 1 Some Curious Experiments In early 1600 William Harvey examined the heart and understood it&amp;rsquo;s a pump. A few years after Rene Descartes this concluded that machines cannot think - arrange it&amp;rsquo;s speech so it makes sense - what even the lowest type of man can do.

Basics Introduction Often AIs are like very smart 5-years old. They can do a lot of things, but need careful instructions to do them well. AI can automate tasks that cost you countless hours now. Prompting Giving Instructions Role Prompting Assign a role to a the AI. E.g.: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a lawyer&amp;rdquo;. Awesome ChatGPT prompts Few shot prompting shot: result shot: result shot: other_result shot Present sample, present expected output, let it do more.</description></item><item><title>Review whole codebase easily</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2023-01-26-review_whole_codebase/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2023-01-26-review_whole_codebase/</guid><description>Recently, a student asked me to review a small project hosted on GitHub. Initially, I assumed I would use the Pull Request/Code Review functionality of GitHub to do so. I found an easy way to perform it on the whole codebase.
However, I eventually decided that I wanted to have a broader view, rather than just looking at a small portion of the changes through the Code Review&amp;rsquo;s microscope. Utilizing an IDE that could visualize the connections in the code and show how things were being used and defined also helped me a lot.</description></item><item><title>CS50 React Native</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2022-11-09-cs50_react_native/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2022-11-09-cs50_react_native/</guid><description>Youtube

If you like the notes, please consider buying the book.
First It&amp;rsquo;s Crazy at Work Workday is being sliced into tiny moments by an onslaught of distractions. Unhealthy obsession with growth. Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it&amp;rsquo;s a mark of stupidity. The answer isn&amp;rsquo;t more hours, it&amp;rsquo;s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production.</description></item><item><title>Do not let anyone overpay you</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-04-22-do_not_let_anyone_overpay_you/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-04-22-do_not_let_anyone_overpay_you/</guid><description>source
The moment one customer pays you a lot more than any other customer, you&amp;rsquo;re no longer a product but a consulting company working for the big payers. You&amp;rsquo;ll do what they say. Self-sufficient. We would never allow a customer to pay more than top-tier price. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bit company with special demands, we don&amp;rsquo;t want your money. We wanted to build a self-service software company. Not need an army of key account managers keeping the whales happy.</description></item><item><title>Clean Code</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-04-02-clean_code/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-04-02-clean_code/</guid><description>NOTE: TOC and these notes do not strictly correspond to the order used in the book itself.
Clean Code Code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. It is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don&amp;rsquo;t understand the risks of making messes. We are authors. Ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1. Making it easy to read actually makes it easier to write.</description></item><item><title>Prusa Link Architecture</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-03-01-prusa_link_architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-03-01-prusa_link_architecture/</guid><description>Main Driver parse CLI args setup logging instantiate main class and run logging log = logging.getLogger(__name__) # -l on CLI for setting debug levels for module, level in log_levels: logging.getLogger(module).setLevel(level) config Uses extendparser in config.py

Takedown Ignore the real world The real world isn&amp;rsquo;t a place, it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse. It&amp;rsquo;s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.
Learning from mistakes is overrated Failure is not a prerequisite for success.
People who failed have the same amount of success as people who have never tried at all.
Long term business planing is fantasy.
Start referring to any of your plans as guesses.</description></item><item><title>The Pragmatic Programmer</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-03-16-the_pragmatic_programmer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-03-16-the_pragmatic_programmer/</guid><description>From Journeyman to Master

Choreographing One of the worst traps a developer can fall into is writing a bunch of code and then going back and testing it all at the end. With the advent of social networks and the ever-increasing pressure of media attention, defects in your code could be costly to both you and your reputation or that of any company you may represent.</description></item></channel></rss>
