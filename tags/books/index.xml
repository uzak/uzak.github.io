&lt;li>In The Odyssey, Hermes instructs Odysseus when he approaches Circe, who stands for certain kind of matriarchal energy, he is to lift or show his sword. Showing a sword doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean fighting. It can also suggest a joyful decisiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;What can I do? Anything dangerous to do around here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When he approaches what I&amp;rsquo;ll call the &amp;ldquo;deep male&amp;rdquo;, he feels risk.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-loss-of-the-golden-ball">The Loss of the Golden Ball&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>King&amp;rsquo;s eight year old son&amp;rsquo;s golden ball rolls into Wild Man&amp;rsquo;s cage. If he wants the ball back, he&amp;rsquo;s going to have to ask him for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Freud: &amp;ldquo;What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Iron John story says that a man can&amp;rsquo;t expect to find the golden ball in the feminine realm, because that&amp;rsquo;s not where the ball is. The story proposes it lies within the magnetic field of the Wild Man.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wild Man energy, by contrast, leads to &lt;strong>forceful action undertaken, not with cruelty, but with resolve.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[Bucket work implies] much more discipline that most men realize.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The key is under your mother&amp;rsquo;s pillow. Michael Maede: &lt;strong>the pillow is also the place where the mother stores all her expectations for you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The king gives the key into the keeping of the Queen. &lt;strong>A mother&amp;rsquo;s job is, after all, to civilize the boy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The key has to be stolen.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-the-boy-do">What Does the Boy Do?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Exuberance in a child is bad, and at the first sign of it, parents should be severe. Exuberance implies that the wild boy or girl is no longer locked up.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>The fault of the nuclear family today isn&amp;rsquo;t so much that it&amp;rsquo;s crazy and full of double binds, it is that old men outside the nuclear family no longer offer an effective way for the son to break his link with his parents without doing harm to himself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Women can change the embryo to a boy, but only men can change the boy to a man.&lt;/strong> Initiators say that boys need a second birth, this time a birth from men.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Classical solution in many traditional cultures, which send the boy to his father when he is twelve.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When office work and the &amp;ldquo;information revolution&amp;rdquo; begin to dominate, the father-son bond disintegrates. One could say that the father now loses his son five minutes after birth.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-remote-father">The Remote Father&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Zeus energy is male authority accepted for the sake of community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The father in contemporary TV ads never knows what cold medicine to take.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>revenge on remote father.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: when the son is introduced primarily by the mother to feeling, he will learn the female attitude towards masculinity and take a female view of his own father and his own masculinity. Since the father and the mother are in competition for the affection of the son, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get a straight picture of your father out of your mother.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Somewhere around forty, forty-five a movement toward the father takes place naturally.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the Greek myths, Apollo is visualized as a golden man standing on an enormous accumulation of the dark, alert, dangerous energy called Dionysus. The Wild Man in our story includes some of both kinds of energy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="when-one-hair-turns-gold">When One Hair Turns Gold&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Initiation experience begins with two events. 1. clean break with the parents after which the novice goes to the forest, &lt;strong>desert,&lt;/strong> or wilderness. 2. wound that the older men give the boy, which could be scarring of the skin, a cut with a knife, a brushing with nettles, a tooth knocked out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Something in the adolescent male wants risk, courts danger, goes out to the edge - even to the edge of death.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-the-first-day-at-the-pond">The Story: The First Day at the Pond&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Initiation, then, for young men amounts to helping them remember the wound, and by that we mean the soul wounds, or the injuries to the emotional body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Robert Moore: If you&amp;rsquo;re a young man and you&amp;rsquo;re not being admired by an older man, you&amp;rsquo;re being hurt.&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Having a critical, judgemental father amounts to being one of Cronos&amp;rsquo; sons, whom Cronos ate.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Father gives a blow, and the son gets it. And it&amp;rsquo;s a wound the boy remembers for years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mother makes sure the son receives a baptism of shame.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gang members try desperately to learn courage, family loyalty, and discipline from each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having no soul union with other men can be the most damaging would of all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All wounds threaten our princehood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The initiation tells the young man what to do with wounds, the new (by men) and the old.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When people identify themselves with their wounded child, or remain children, the whole culture goes to pieces.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ecstasy too early - or generalized excitement - may be, as James Hillman has remarked, just another way the Great Mother has of keeping the man from developing any discipline.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wild man is not &amp;ldquo;inside&amp;rdquo; of us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the water of soul life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>willingness to be a fish in the holy water, to be fished for by Dionysus or one of the other fishermen. Being a fish is to be active, not with cars or footballs, but with soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Denial mean we live for years in trance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Being brought by the water by a mentor means the end of enchantment.&lt;/strong> The Wild Man&amp;rsquo;s water does not itself heal the wound that led to the escape or ascension, but it gives strength to the part of us that wants to continue the effort to gain courage and be human.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Wild Man here amounts to an invisible presence &amp;hellip; The physicist working with his mentor at Princeton suddenly writes an equation on the board with his golden chalk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>therapy, when it good - waiting by the pond.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Where a man&amp;rsquo;s wound is, that is where his genius will be.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water in symbolic systems does not stand for spiritual or metaphysical impulses (which are better suggested by air or fire), but by earthly and natural life.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-the-second-day">The Story: The Second Day&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we know from shaman stories that their wounds were impersonal. Wounds need to be expanded into air and lifted on the ideas our ancestors new, so that the wound ascents through the roof of our parent&amp;rsquo;s house and we suddenly know how our wound (seemingly so private) fits into a greater and impersonal story.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without the weight given by a wound consciously realized, the man will lead a provisional life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hair represents sexual energy, animal life, passionate flaring nature peculiar to mammals and excess.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the amount of hair suggest how far the instincts are curtailed and the spontaneity curbed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hair suggest thoughts. Even when the conscious system is shut down at night, thoughts keep coming out: some of them are called dreams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hair stands for intuitions that appear out of nowhere&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a human being takes an action, the soul takes an action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the generous response made by the sacred pond spring depends on a serious decisive effort made by a man or woman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Narcissus has already become separated from his male hunting companions as the story opens. It turns out that Hera is also angry at him, and has sent a nymph called Echo who repeats each of his words as soon as he speaks them. Narcissus is bottled up inside his own circuits.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Accepting an initiatory task is more important than succeeding or failing at it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Wild Man&amp;rsquo;s job is to teach the young man how abundant, various and many-sided his manhood is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A man or a woman is not a machine only for protecting, hunting, and reproduction, but each carries desires far beyond what is needed for physical survival.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A young man is asked to descend into his own wounds, to climb up into the ream of &amp;ldquo;the twin&amp;rdquo;, and to expand sideways into the consciousness that is in tress, water, animals and &amp;ldquo;the ten thousand things&amp;rdquo;. Upon achieving these three realizations, the hair turns gold. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve all his problems, but brings new ones. The golden head is going to be a problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-road-of-ashes-descent-and-grief">The Road of Ashes, Descent, and Grief&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>He learned that the whole world is on fire. &amp;ldquo;Everything is intelligent!&amp;rdquo; All of his hair turns gold.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A bit of gold can send us into high altitudes, from which we don&amp;rsquo;t want to descend.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-happens">What Happens&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When I was twenty-eight I still had the &lt;strong>longing for purity, &amp;ldquo;to be above it all,&amp;rdquo; not to be involved.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When Jung established a training center in Zurich, he would not accept a person who was not already a success in some other career. It was a way of saying thirty-five or older.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ascenders &amp;hellip; passivity, naivete, and numbness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For hundreds of thousands of years men have admired each other, and been admired by women, in particular for their activity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During last thirty (sixty ATM) years men have been asked to learn how to go with the flow, follow rather than lead, live in a non hierarchical way, how to be vulnerable, how to adopt to consensus decision-making.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Passivity increases exponentially as the education system turns out &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a man sulks, he becomes passive to his own hurts. When no old men appear to break the hold of the sulking infant, the habit of passivity spreads to other parts of his life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The passive man may not say what he wants, and the wife has to guess it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The passive man may ask his wife to do the loving for him; his children to do his loving for him.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A woman does not want a man to tell her what to do, but other forces may have turned her away from a fruitful action or act. If her husband sees this happening, he should tell her about it. A man hopes a woman will tell him as well, if she sees him accepting the direction of invisible forces.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adolescent &amp;ldquo;in trouble&amp;rdquo; who is &amp;ldquo;acting out&amp;rdquo; may in fact be transferring some of the anxiety between mother and father to himself, and in that sense carrying it. Children are active in loving to the point of sacrificing themselves&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="naivete">Naivete&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the naive man feels pride in being attacked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The naive will be also proud that he can pick up the pain of others, particularly women&amp;rsquo;s pain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sincerity is a big thing with him.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The naive man will lose what is most precious to him because of a lack of boundaries.&lt;/strong> Unaware of boundaries, he does not develop a good container for his soul, nor a good container for two people. There is a leak in it somewhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The naive man tends to have an &lt;strong>inappropriate relation to ecstasy. He longs for ecstasy at the wrong time or in the wrong place, and ignores all masculine sources of it. He wants it through the feminine, through Great Mother, through the goddess, even though what may be grounding for the woman ungrounds him.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The man without limitations may also &lt;strong>specialize in not telling.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know that there is a being in him that wants to remain sick.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>His timing is off.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is something in naivete that &lt;strong>demands betrayal.&lt;/strong> The naive man will have curious link to betrayal, deceit and lies. Not only he will betray others easily, but when a woman lives with a truly naive man for a while, she feels impersonally impelled to betray him. When there is too much naivete around, the universe has no choice but to crystallize out some betrayal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="numbness">Numbness&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A spiritual man may love light, and yet be entirely numb in the chest area.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A mother&amp;rsquo;s protection, no matter how well intentioned, will not do as a substitute for the father&amp;rsquo;s protection.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-taking-kitchen-work">The Story: Taking Kitchen Work&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go out into the world now and there you&amp;rsquo;ll learn what poverty is.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="katabasis">Katabasis&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>lowliness, associated with water and soul, as height is associated with spirit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drop - ancient Greek called katabasis. Our ego doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to do it and even if we drop, the ego doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to see it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When &amp;ldquo;katabasis&amp;rdquo; happens, a man no longer feels like a special person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These days katabasis comes through addiction - alcohol, cocaine, crack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life somewhoe &amp;ldquo;discharges&amp;rdquo; him. There are many ways: a serious accident, the loss of a job, the breaking of a long-standing friendship, a divorce, or a &amp;ldquo;break-down&amp;rdquo;, an illness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve just been promoted&amp;rdquo; Jung would say: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m very sorry to hear that; but if we all stick together, I think we will get through it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Kitchen work means intensification of the dipping (into the wound). This is the time to live it out.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He does not exist, as the hero does, through his heroism, nor through his invincibility, as the warrior does, but he exists through his would.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The way down and out doesn&amp;rsquo;t require poverty, homelessness, physical deprivation, dishwasher work, necessarily, but it does seem to require a fall from status, from a human being to a spider, from a middle-class person to a derelict. The emphasis is on the consciousness of the fall.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a divorce, man&amp;rsquo;s emotional safety may disintegrate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Marriage&amp;rsquo;s breakup or breakdown revives the wound.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divorce feels for most men like a discharge, as if one had been fired from a task taken on the day of the wedding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the man refuses to be cheered up, and considers all the discomforts to be cunning expression of an isolating would received in early childhood, then the man can use the divorce - like any other serious collapse - as an invitation to go through the door, accept katabasis, immerse himself in the wound, and exit from his old life through it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christ: &amp;ldquo;You shall not get out until have paid the last penny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Some power in the psyche arranges a severe katabasis if the man does not know enough to go down on his own.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some Sufi groups begin their night-work with a repeated word reminding them of the grief of what they have not done the past year.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing the dark side of a person close to us is a discipline the descender accepts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is said that in the marriage, the man and women give each other &amp;ldquo;his or her nethermost beast&amp;rdquo; to hold. Each holds the leash for the &amp;ldquo;nethermost beast&amp;rdquo; of the other.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dark side of Great Mother, one with boar tusks coming from her lips. Angry woman. Compensation for earlier life &amp;ldquo;above the ground&amp;rdquo;, being fed with fish and fowl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we are betrayed the toothed side of the universe shows its mouth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kali. Only Shiva, one of the forms of Wild Man, can stand up to her.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pwyll, Prince of Dyved, whose story appears in The Mabinogion, does not become king until he has exchanged places for a year with the King of the Underworld.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We reach the bottom when Baba Yaga&amp;rsquo;s hostile boar energy has completely replaces - for a time - the childlike eros which each of us felt when our mother set a breast to our mouth, or later set a cup of milk down for us at the table, or when our first marvelous girlfriend beckoned us to bed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The only solution to the power of the witch is for young man to develop energy as great as hers, as harsh, as wild, as shred, as clear in its desire.&lt;/strong> When a young man arrives at her house, proves himself to be up her level of intensity, purpose, and respect for the truth, she will sometimes say, &amp;ldquo;Okay, what do you want know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="taking-the-road-of-ashes">Taking the Road of Ashes&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ashes do not belong to the sunlit crown of the tree, nor to its strong roots. Ash is literally the death of the trunk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>life of ashes is very different form dropping into katabasis. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a fall in social status. It is not so explosive; there is something about ashes that is &lt;strong>steady, even lethargic.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Young men in Viking times were allowed sometimes two or three years of ashes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some kind of hibernation or ritual lethargy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>before a boy can become a man, some infantile being in him must die.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The gold-obsessed man, whether New Age man or a Dow Jones, can be said to be the man who hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet handled ashes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At thirty-five his inner stove begins to produce ashes as well. It&amp;rsquo;s time for him to by a small black shovel in the hardware store and get down on his knees.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some habitual error we keep making in our relationships produces more ash than heat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ashes present a great diminishment away from the living tree with its huge crown and abundant shade. Proper experience for men who are over thirty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A man may keep his job and family and still experience ashes if he knows hat he is doing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Somewhere in our past life there is a dead body. Could be a career mislaid, relationship gone into the river, or the corpse of ashamed boy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="learning-to-shudder">Learning to Shudder&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it is Dionysus, the last of the Greek gods to be developed, who guides that secret process in which the young man or woman learns to shudder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cruel titans.&lt;/strong> The horror at what these can do makes one shudder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gaining the ability to shudder means feeling how frail human beings are, and how awful it is to be a Titan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Just as Hermes helps &amp;ldquo;through the lines&amp;rdquo; on the road to retain the corpse, he is helped to shudder by the god Dionysus, the grandson of Titans.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="going-from-the-mothers-house-to-the-fathers-house">Going from the Mother&amp;rsquo;s House to the Father&amp;rsquo;s House&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Boys have lived happily since the birth in the mother&amp;rsquo;s world, and the father&amp;rsquo;s would naturally seem dangerous, unsteady, and full of unknowns.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Until eight to twelve boys lived exclusively with women.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A young man cannot make the move to the father&amp;rsquo;s world alone without taking on the dark side of the Trickster. Learn to &lt;em>rob the robbers&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A man&amp;rsquo;s effort to move to father&amp;rsquo;s house takes a long time; it&amp;rsquo;s difficult, and each man has to do it for himself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Convincing the naive boy or the comfort-loving boy, to die.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Beneath Father, being a snake, associates with the spinal cord.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>when a man accepts the Descent as a way to move to the father&amp;rsquo;s house, he learns to look at the death side of things, he glaces down to the rat&amp;rsquo;s hole, and he accepts the &lt;strong>snake rather than the bird as his animal.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Initiation asks the son to move his love energy away from the attractive mother to the relatively unattractive serpent father.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>he regards Descent as a holy thing, he increases his tolerance for ashes, eats dust as snakes do, increases his stomach for terrifying insights, deepens his ability to digest the evil facts of history, accepts the job of working seven years under the ground, leaves granary at will through the rat&amp;rsquo;s hole, follows the voice of old mole below the ground.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Apollo was present at the spring, Saturn,&lt;/strong> natural container of restraint, melancholy, fast systems, disciplined repetition, mentor standards and heavy grieving &lt;strong>is concealed in the ashes work.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturn, helps men to get heavy with the full weight of their wound, and the full power of their failures. After Saturn introduces a man to Lord of Melancholy, that man begins the black courtship of the soul which eventually leads the man to the Garden.&lt;/li>

&lt;h4 id="too-little-father">Too Little Father&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>traditional cultures seem to have plenty of father&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In most tribal cultures fathers and son live in an amused tolerance of each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both male and female cells carry marvelous music, but the son needs to resonate to the masculine frequency as well as to the female frequency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Women cannot replace that particular missing substance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="distrust-of-older-men">Distrust of Older Men&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The so, having used up much of his critical, cynical energy suspecting old men, may compensate by being naive about women - or men - his own age.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A contemporary man often assumes that a woman knows more about a relationship than he does, allows a woman&amp;rsquo;s moods to run the house, assumes that when she attacks him , she is doing it &amp;ldquo;for his own good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="temperament-without-teaching">Temperament Without Teaching&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>in most families today, the sons and daughters receive, when the father returns home at six, only his disposition, or his temperament, which is usually irritable and remote.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>father as a living force in the home disappeared when those forces demanding industry sent him on various railroads out of his various villages.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="the-darkened-father">The Darkened Father&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>as political and mythological kings die, the father loses the radiance he once absorbed from the sun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>eternal boy, understands his flight upward as a revolt against the earthly, conservative, possessive, clinging part of the maternal feminine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>many contemporary sons, do not fight the father as in earlier eras, or figure out strategies to defeat him, but instead ascend above him, beyond him, determined to have a higher consciousness than their father. That is not wrong at all, but it is flying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I count myself among the sons who have endured years of deprivation, disconnection from earth, thin air, the loneliness of the long-distance runner, in order to go high in the air and be seen. Such a son attempts to redeem the &amp;ldquo;endarkened father&amp;rdquo; by becoming &amp;ldquo;enlightened&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A man may of course pursue spirituality too early in his life. The ascension, then, I add to our list of imbalances brought about by the diminishment and belittlement of the father.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Society without father produces this birdlike men, so intense, so charming, so open to addiction, so sincere&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Wild man carried him off his shoulders. Then he went down along with his damaged finger into the water, then rose steeply when his whole head turned gold, then descended again and experienced his &lt;strong>Ashes Time in the kitchen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are two kings. Father - first king. And a new king. After some time in the kitchen, the cook gives him an order to take the food to the king.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>why, in our twenties and thirties, are the visits so short.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>we long for that oceanic feeling we felt in the womb, when we were divine and fed by ambrosia. Addiction amounts to an attempt to escape limitations and stay in the King&amp;rsquo;s room.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Many of us go up the stairs even before he cook asks us to and through alcohol, sex, or cocaine, extend the visit beyond moments allotted for it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Singles bar -fantastic alchemical ovens where attempts to fuse crude metals go on day after day, night after night - resemble King&amp;rsquo;s room.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>even though we&amp;rsquo;ve done good ashes work, the soul is still contaminated with infantile angers, unrealistic hopes, and rage at our parents or at ourselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our soul, when it is in the kitchen, resembles some sort of crude or mixed rock. &lt;strong>The king, who lives in his room high in the castle among air and sunlight, has arrived at unity;&lt;/strong> undistorted, unmingled, as compared to the boy of ashes, he looks on matters differently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The lesser wedding is a union or fusion of substances not yet thoroughly separated or discriminated. It is always followed by a death&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who ignore &amp;ldquo;the cook&amp;rdquo; may become stuck in the kitchen stage for years, identified with the victim child, who knows only ashes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-king-in-his-three-realms">The King in His Three Realms&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="the-sacred-king">The Sacred King&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>King in the imaginative or invisible world, in the sacred space. From there he acts as a magnet and rearranges human molecules.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The King and the Queen send their energy down. Solar King and Lunar Queen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord of the Four Quarters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>overarching inner heaven.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>estimate that people in the West lost their ability to think mythologically around the year 1000. Perhaps because Christianity would not allow any new stories, gods or perhaps because after the Renaissance the pursuit of science absorbed more and more imaginative energy. European men and women gradually stopped feeding the abundant gods and goddesses with their imaginative energy - their heaven collapsed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sacred or Solar King is the principle of order and space.&lt;/strong> When he is present, there is a sacred space free of chaos. He does not create order, simply where he is, there is order.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sacred King blesses. He encourages creativity as his realm.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="the-earthly-king">The Earthly King&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The political king meres heavenly sun power and earthly authority.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sun King and his Moon queen held societies for about 4000 years together. They began to fail in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the political king disappears from the lanes, we find it difficult to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; or feel the Eternal King.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He derives his energy and authority from his ability to be transparent or receptive to the King above him. Few actual kings are that good, but the three-tiered world depends on his trying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We need to see the Sacred King not &amp;ldquo;with but through the eyes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>, and to see our radiant inner King uncontaminated by the images of fallen Herods or dead Stalins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="the-inner-king">The Inner King&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One who knows what we want to do for the rest of our lives, rest of the month, rest of the day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>He can make clear what we want without being contaminated in his choice by the opinions of others around us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vigorous when were were one or two years old. For most of was was killed early on. Inner warriors were not strong enough to protect the King.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When my King is weak, I ask my wife or children what is the right thing to do.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the younger men have no public man to whom they can give their King, how can they develop the King inside?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the outward flesh-and-blood king falls, his plunge downward entangles the fail Kings in the other two layers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The inner King, once recovered, required feeding and honoring if he is to remain alive.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="the-double-stream-inside-the-sacred-king">The Double Stream Inside the Sacred King&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A second, darker side of the king, who will curse young men, discourage creativity, establish - by his presence alone - disorder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devil to be the brother of Christ.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="the-double-stream-inside-the-father">The Double Stream Inside the Father&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We are now looking at a mentor in this world, or a Scared King in the other world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>father contains both Kings at once.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An apparently weak father can control the entire family from beneath with his silence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Destructive Father does not give energy to those in his family but draws it out of them into some black hole he shelter in himself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stories of no guidance, no support, no affection, and in their place sarcasm, brutality, coldness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>James Hillman: &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re still being hurt by an event that happened to you at twelve, it is the thought that is hurting you now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no father who will be good all the way, either.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we insist he was an evil person, who shamed us all the time, we fall into victimhood and there is no longer a place for us in the story.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="the-longing-to-live-with-the-king">The Longing to Live with the King&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We cannot move to Sacred or Blessing King, until we&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with the ax-father.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Children visit the King, but adults make a place where the King can visit them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Son&amp;rsquo;s first job is to redo the room, clean it, widen it, refurnish it, honor the father&amp;rsquo;s clear and helpful side.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Add a room onto the apartment to house the Destructive King and his relatives.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t made two rooms, furnished them we can&amp;rsquo;t expect our father, living or dead, to move in. &lt;strong>Then you can think of inviting a mentor in. He&amp;rsquo;ll also need two rooms.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Same for king. The King is a &amp;ldquo;man of the world&amp;rdquo; and he will never come to live in these cheap one-room apartments we have available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>After the mentor has come, we might think of inviting the King to the refurbished rooms where the mentor has lived.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-male-as-a-set-apart-being">The Male As a Set-Apart Being&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>each child begins in the womb as female, and the fetus chosen to be male goes through hundreds of changes before he is born.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>a stone, while attached to the mountainside or the bedrock, is female. It becomes a male stone when it is moved away from its quarry place and set up by itself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are no good fathers in the major stories of Greek mythology, and very few in the Old Testament.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever the father gives us, it will not be the same of closeness that our mother offered.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In many traditional cultures the men older than the father give and teach nurturing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mother -&amp;gt; Earth -&amp;gt; old men.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Father&amp;rsquo;s birth gift is one thing, and old men&amp;rsquo;s gift another.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Father contributes to the love of knowledge, love of action, and the ways to honor the world of things. He gave and gives a sheathing, or envelope, or coating around the soul made of intensity, shrewdness, desire to penetrate, liveliness, impulse, daring. His gift cannot be quantified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The perceived absence of the father is actually the absence of the King.&lt;/strong> Addiction does not have to do with Colombian drug logs, but with the absence of the King.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The boy, after he left with the Wild Man, has been introduced well to soul.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The boy is about to meet the feminine in a non maternal form, in its powerful, blossoming, savvy, wild, investigating, erotic, playful form.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Celts do a great deal of work in distinguishing two forms of feminine energy, or &amp;ldquo;yin&amp;rdquo;, an earthly form and a starry, moonlike or sunlike form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The moon is attractive to the sun, and draws light from the sun.&lt;/strong> So the call her the &amp;ldquo;Silver Woman&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Woman Who Loves Gold&amp;rdquo; is not contradictory.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-meeting-the-kings-daughter">The Story: Meeting the King&amp;rsquo;s Daughter&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Meeting with the feminine woman after the ashes. &lt;strong>Fruitful meeting of that sort can only happen after the man has left the cellar and gone into &amp;ldquo;the garden&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The cook took pity on the boy and exchanged him for the gardener boy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kairos: the right moment for what was lying hidden in one&amp;rsquo;s fate to be revealed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sunlight hits the gold hair, bounce of the wall to princess&amp;rsquo; chamber, from there into her eyes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mercury or Hermes watches over the process of alchemy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="entering-the-garden">Entering the Garden&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>European walled garden of the Middle Ages contains &lt;em>fons mercurialis&lt;/em>, Mercury&amp;rsquo;s Well, or the Well of Hermes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hermes guides the forming of containers, the establishment of boundaried places.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entering the garden we escape the rain of blowers offered by &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rdquo; and find a temporary shelter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Where springs not fail&amp;rdquo; is a quality of garden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The walled garden also is a place to develop introversion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>gr:Pluto = &amp;ldquo;wealth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For men an unnamed god of duty holds down the surface of the earth. There a man makes a stand, makes an empire, but sooner or later, if he&amp;rsquo;s lucky, the time comes to go inward, and to live in &amp;ldquo;the garden&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is in the garden that a man finds the wealth of psyche.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the walled garden, as in the alchemical vessel, new metals get formed and the old ones melt. The lead of depression melts and becomes grief. The drive for success, an insistent tin, joins with Aphrodite&amp;rsquo;s copper, and makes bronze, which is good to make both shields and images of the gods.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This new work in the garden means a coming out of basement space into wind and weather.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the garden we&amp;rsquo;re still doing work &amp;ldquo;in the darkness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the garden the soul and nature marry. &lt;strong>When we love cultivation more then excitement we are ready to start a garden.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The most important events in the lives of the great lovers take place in the Garden Not Open to Everyone.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The enclosed garden encourages true desire for the infinite more than the greed for objects.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Renaissance accounts: it was not unusual for a young man to take two or three years off, and spend it learning to be a lover. Learn to play a musical instrument, learn poems &amp;ldquo;by heart&amp;rdquo;, practice setting them to his own music, and then sing them to introverted women sitting behind iron window bars.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To lovers everything looks better&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lovers are full of praise&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Making a garden, and living in it, means attention to boundaries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Addiction to perfection amounts to having no garden. Shame keeps us from cultivating a garden.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-woman-with-golden-hair-and-delicious-confusion">The Woman with Golden Hair and Delicious Confusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>they saw the Track of the Moon on the Water and were deliciously confused (teenage boys upon seeing a teenage beauty).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>One man about 35 told me: After a few months, everything collapses; she becomes an ordinary woman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The glory of the Woman with Golden Hair drifts down from its eternal luminous space onto a public figure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During the 12th and 13th centuries all this was understood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Wild flowers would please here more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;re on the way from overly obedient man to wildness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We move from Saint George toward the dragon.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a man is ready to make a decisive move towards &amp;ldquo;The Legends&amp;rdquo;, a feminine figure whose face &amp;ldquo;looks both ways&amp;rdquo; may appear in his dreams. One looks toward the world of rule and laws, the other toward wildness, adult manhood, moistness, desire. She is the Woman with the Golden Hair.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She resembles Shakti, erect, instigating, fiery, outrageous.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="hermes-and-the-god-woman">Hermes and the God-Woman&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hermes is the god if the interior nervous system. His energy is also called Odin, Mercury.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True learning doesn&amp;rsquo;t take place unless Hermes is present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The whole Ph.D. system was created by Germanic Hermes-killers. Hermes is magical, detail-loving, obscene, dancelike, goofy, and not on a career track.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What people call a Freudian slip is really a Hermes precision.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mercury is the nearest of all planets to the sun, so so he is the sun&amp;rsquo;s closest relative.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mercury has the ability to liquefy gold and silver. In the presence of Hermes, a flow between the masculine and feminine in our story has begun to happen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hermes and Aphrodite go very well together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever one receives in the garden is to be given away. And the head covering needs to remain on. In the general the public wants artists to show their gold immediately. Iron John story implies be cautious about showing paintings at the twenties or publishing a book too early.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once the garden - which may take ten years to develop - has been experienced, then we could say the young man has begun to honor his own soul, has learned to become a lover, and has learned to dance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="to-bring-the-interior-warriors-back-to-life">To Bring the Interior Warriors Back to Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>warriorhood follows the garden - Celts: &amp;ldquo;Never give a sword to a man who can&amp;rsquo;t dance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-warriors-inside">The Warriors Inside&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>warriors, mythologically, lift their swords to defend the king.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The inner warriors do not cross boundary aggressively&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>when our parents do not respect our territory at all, their disrespect seems overwhelming proof of our inadequacy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the child, stiffens with shock, and falls into &lt;strong>timeless fossilized confusion of shame.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-outer-or-disciplined-warrior">The Outer, or Disciplined, Warrior&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Indo-European civilizations: the King, the Warrior, the Farmer. There are three sorts of ceremonies, three sorts of living life, three world views, three gods and goddesses for each way.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Romans: Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Greeks: Zeus and Hera, Ares, Dionysus and Ariande&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Northern Europe: Odin, Thor, Frey and Freya&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>quality of a true warrior is that he is in service to a purpose greater than himself - to a transcendent cause.&lt;/strong> Mythologically, he&amp;rsquo;s in service to a True King. If the King he serves is corrupt, or there is no King and all, and he&amp;rsquo;s serving greed, or power, then he&amp;rsquo;s no longer a warrior, but a solder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Japanese story: pond has lost its King; uncertain what to do, the pond&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants finally elect a heron (who&amp;rsquo;s in Japan is associated with the warrior) to be King. The heron eats up everyone in the pond.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the warrior is in service to a True King - to a transcendent cause - he does well and his body becomes a hardworking servant, which he requires to endure cold, heat, pain, wounds, scarring, hunger, lack of sleep, hardship of all kings.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A clawed hand takes the comfort-loving baby away, and an adult warrior inhabits the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strategy as an essential quality of true warrior. Includes cunning, worldliness, intelligence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-eternal-or-sacred-warrior">The Eternal, or Sacred, Warrior&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The physical warrior loves the battlefield. The Holy Warrior loves the field of good and evil. Light vs. Darkness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A Sacred King and Queen live in the Luminous Realm, but the Holy Warrior also lives there.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Sacred Warrior has a blessed side and a poisoned side.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the Holy Warrior falls, he entangles the warriors in the two other places in his fall.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lover and warrior mingles. Nowadays that mingling is mostly gone. The physical warrior disintegrated into solder when mechanized warfare come on. Ares it not present on the contemporary battlefield.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The disciplined warrior, made irrelevant by mechanizes war, disdained and abandoned by high-tech culture, is fading in American men. The fading of the warrior contributes to the collapse of civilized society.&lt;/strong> A man who cannot defend his own space cannot defend women and children. The poisoned warriors called drug lords prey primarily for recruits on kingless, warriorless boys.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our story goes back to a time when the warrior was still honored.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-the-battle-scene">The Story: The Battle Scene&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>it is our own psyche (Kingdom) that has been invaded.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The invasion is more than a distraction, the story says that the King is losing the battle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Time for the warrior in us to learn to fight. We notice that in the story the warrior pursues the battle to the end - no halfway measures in mind, no pulling back.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mithraic cave: &amp;ldquo;Just as the God kills the bull, I kill my own passions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The battle we are discussing happens in a ritual space, and we expect that some sort of wheat, or corn, or honey will come from these &amp;ldquo;bodies&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> Bible: bees make honey inside the dead body of the hostile lion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being passive, hiring an expert to fight our enemy, won&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The enemy in our story is never named.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="gaining-a-four-legged-horse">Gaining a Four-legged Horse&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Four&amp;rdquo; is complete - four-gated city, four directions, for rivers of Paradise, four Seasons, four letters of the Holy Name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The horse reminds of the animal side of human beings, and of the body. The rider stands for the intelligence or the intellect or mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The fourth leg is a shamed leg. The animal has been crippled by shame.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we were very tiny, our horse had all four legs. By the time the child in our culture is twelve, at least one of the legs will be crippled by shame.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We need an older man, or a mentor, who will provide is with a four-legged horse. We know we have to return it, but just the experience what it is to ride a horse without a crippled legs, even for a few minutes, is worth it all.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Iron John, lending us the horse, does not away with out early shaming; that cannot be done away with. But we can work to prevent further shaming. And we can learn what connection we still have to that earlier, four-legged horse.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="warriorhood-in-teaching-in-literature-and-in-science">Warriorhood in Teaching, in Literature and in Science&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>disappearance of fierce debates is a loss. &lt;strong>When the playful verbal combats disappears, then warriorhood becomes reduced to wrestling, football, the martial warfare, blood-and-guts movies.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Science adopted generational struggle during the Renaissance as a means of progress, and still uses it. Blake fought a mental fight against Newton.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The collapse of the warrior means that the sword is thrown away.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-pelasgian-creation-myth">The Pelasgian Creation Myth&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>more than one American man today needs a sword to cut his adult soul away from his mother-bound soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sharp interior sword. Tibetans refer to it as &amp;ldquo;the Vajra sword&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We may need a sword to cut us apart from our own self-pity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pelasgian creation myth: Once upon a time there was an egg floating on the ocean. Then a sword cut the egg in two. It turned out that Eros was inside the egg.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No sword, no Eros in the World.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Such a history of creation is history of discriminations. Great Cutter arrived and divided matter into heavy and light. Then he appeared once more and divided the light stuff that became Fire and Air. Then he divided the heavy matter into Earth and Water.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Divine Cutter - Logos&lt;/strong> - kept dividing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These cuttings resulted in the finely articulated, singing, beautifully detailed, shining world of minute particulars that the landscape painters love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Cutter leaves behind its tracks as pair of opposites that exist everywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: Animals always remain what they are. But human beings are suggestible and can lose distinction. When they merge into &amp;ldquo;the masses&amp;rdquo;, they fall into indistinctiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gnostics: &lt;strong>Pleroma - place of enormous abundance, but also enormous indistinction.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;prodigious complexity&amp;rdquo; we all love depends both in nature and in culture on a love of distinctiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="warriorhood-in-marriage-and-relationship">Warriorhood in Marriage and Relationship&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>conscious fighting is great help in relationships between men and women.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;American marriages are the saddest in the whole world, because the man does all his fighting at the office.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When shouts of rage come out of the man, it means his warriors have not been able to protect his chest;&lt;/strong> the lances have already entered, and it is too late.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Begin identifying the weapons that have come down through their family lines. Short dagger used unexpectedly, spiked mace which swings down onto the soldier&amp;rsquo;s head, broad indiscriminate sword, doorway lance&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A good fight gets things clear, and I think women long to fight and to be with men who know how to fight well.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When both use their weapons unconsciously or without naming them, both man and woman stumble into the battle, and when it is over the two interior children can be badly wounded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The adult warrior inside both men and women, when trained, can receive a blow without sulking or collapsing, knows how to fight for limited goals, keeps the rules of combat in mind, and is able to keep the fighting clean and to establish limits.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a woman has a fair argument, it is not right for the man to leave; he should stay and fight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Anger comes from personal level, rage from an archetypal core.&lt;/strong> It comes out of centuries of abuse. &lt;strong>If taken into relationships, it destroys.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The interior warrior in both men and women can help them to fight on the human plane.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If men and woman have only soldiers or shamed children inside, they will have to settle for damaging battles constantly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Two kinds of iron: magnetic associated with sky-gods, that has &amp;ldquo;fallen from heavens&amp;rdquo; and ordinary, with earthly dark gods, such as Set, who pursues and kills the solar god, Osiris.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Iron often considered lucky - horseshoes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Iron associated with intellect and spiritual warfare.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Vajra sword should cut apart what has been inappropriately joined.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if we feel to young to inhabit the dangerous space between male and female? A child can easily become a professional bridge. Conducting metal - copper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mother and father talk through the child.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copper is such a good conductor, that the boy doesn&amp;rsquo;t heat up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intense isolation of the father. Intensity of female suffering.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The child loses his distinctiveness by learning to be a conductor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more the man agrees to be copper, the more he becomes neither alive nor dead, but an amorphous, demasculinized, half-alive psychic conductor.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conducting large amounts of charm and niceness is also dangerous.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ingesting excessive amounts of copper is an occupational hazard for therapists, priests, ministers, resembling the hazards of ingesting the lead that some factory workers endure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Men and women, often become conductors not from bravery or openness to change, but from a longing for comfort, for peace in the house, for padded swords, for protective coloration, a longing to be the quail hiding in fall reeds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Becoming a conductor is not achieving andrygony. &lt;strong>Hermaphrodite is an image from alchemy and becomes possible on an inner plane after years of distinctiveness, years of cutting, opposites and discrimination. A false androgyny is achieved early through conduction, but usually neither Hermes nor Aphrodite are present.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="sustaining-the-tension-between-opposites">Sustaining the Tension Between Opposites&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We lose our childhood and a lot of playfulness by becoming copper wires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We become suspicious of all forms of merging. It is right to &lt;strong>examine all mergings:&lt;/strong> merging of molester and victim, of tyrant and citizen, of company and employee, of group mind and personal mind, of husband and wife.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Men and women, must learn, when faced with excessive merging, to say as the little boy did: &amp;ldquo;Get away! Shut up!&amp;rdquo;. Some merging is right, some is not. &lt;strong>Our intuition will tell us when the merging is appropriate; then it is the warrior inside who can teach us how to hold boundaries.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>able to sustain the tension between opposites, with neither attitude understood as wrong, but different.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Choice: bridging opposites with Aphrodite&amp;rsquo;s metal, copper, or living in the opposites, while not coming down hard on either side.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="living-in-the-opposites">Living in the Opposites&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>live between opposites, not only recognising that they exist, but rejoicing that they exist.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>does not mean identifying with one side and then belittling the other, regarding it as enemy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rejoicing in the opposites means pushing the opposites apart with our imaginations as to create space and then enjoying the fantastic music coming from each side.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Catholic church, obsessed with the opposites of pagan and Christian attitude, identified with one side during the Inquisition and the result was disastrous. In any religion it is tempting for ascetic men to identify with the male pole. Then, disguised as spiritual warriors they are angry at women all through life.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="admiring-paris-choice">Admiring Paris&amp;rsquo; Choice&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ares&amp;rsquo; sister was Eris (Discord), she was the one who caused trouble for Paris lending him a golden apple.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Paris saw Hera and her Rooted Earth Energy, Aphrodite and her Erotic Joy, and Athena and her Estatic Spiritual Knowledge.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choosing a goddess is very different from identifying with one side of pair opposites. The question here is what you really love. &lt;strong>Eris says choose what you want and then pay for it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;the one precious thing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the instant Paris indicates his choice with his wand, the king wakes up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>New Age people are in general addicted to harmony. Child does not become adult until it breaks addiction to harmony, chooses one precious thing, and enters into a joyful participation in the tensions of the world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The battle happens over and over. &lt;strong>Each time we use the warrior well, we&amp;rsquo;re awakening the King.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be shamed by you, if that&amp;rsquo;s all right with you&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accepting thorns as well as the rose, living in scarcity, doing the unpleasant, avoid talk of how things might be better.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conducting is unconscious and naming it helps move it to communication. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be a conductor for you any longer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Odyssey says there are suitors inside who want to marry the soul. These toothy suitors have plans for you life. If a person never lifts the sword, he might get high marks for gentleness, but he may end up as a slave to the suitors or target of an arranged wedding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now that the images of eternal warrior and outward warrior no longer provide the model, one major task of contemporary men is to &lt;strong>reimagine the value of the warrior in relationships, in literary studies, in thought, in emotion&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the energy that loves to fight need to learn to play all over again.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>For about forty years, the young in our culture have generated forms - music, fashions, behaviours - that prolong the initiatory moment &amp;hellip; as though hoping to be something initiated by chance somewhere along the way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The prolongation of the initiatory moment has everything to do with the massive drug market in the US.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Five stages:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>bonding with mother and separation from mother.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bonding with father and separation from the father&lt;/li>
&lt;li>arrival of mentor, who helps to man to rebuild the bridge to his own greatness/essence and to his &amp;ldquo;Gold Head.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>apprentice to a hurricane energy such as the Wild Man, or the Warrior, or Dionysus, or Apollo. When he has done well, the young man receives a drink from the waters of the god (Such a drink is one thing the adolescents are asking for).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>marriage with the Holy Women or the Queen.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The personal father draws down both the orderly and twisted/poisoned side of the Sacred King.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From Great Mother also her accepting, nourishing, praising positive side flows down to the son. But she&amp;rsquo;s got also a &lt;strong>Twisted, possessive side,&lt;/strong> for she too is an immense hurricane energy that puts her clawed hand through the wall. &amp;ldquo;It is necessary to steal the key from under mother&amp;rsquo;s pillow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>conscious mother, aware of the power she is exercising over the child, and &lt;strong>unconscious mother, who keeps running Great Mother programs in her grain over and over, hardly distinguishing between partnership and domination.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Twisted side of Great Mother &lt;strong>doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the boy to pass out of her realm. She does not curse him as the Twisted side of the Sacred King, but she holds him.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It isn&amp;rsquo;t the personal mother who imprisons the son - she wants him to be free. It is the possessive or primitive side of the Great Mother.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Stepmother&amp;rdquo; is a code word in fairy tales for Poisoned Side of the Great Mother.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collectivized education puts whole nations to sleep.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sometimes the intellectual ideas the mother brings to the son late at night are a blessing, sometimes not - the boy could end up years later isolated in a high mental tower. If the union takes place on a feeling level, he could end up imprisoned under the water.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sioux were more aware of the possibilities of psychic incest between mother and son.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Frank disclosure is often better than silence, but it becomes harmful if the son feels he has to do something about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In American culture two trends come together, emphasis on adult man&amp;rsquo;s inadequacy and woman&amp;rsquo;s increased awareness of her own interior emotional richness. Hope for change and fulfillment falls on young sons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>at forty or forty-five, he realizes that his task throughout his life has been to be substitute husband, lover, and soul companion for his mother.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the boy finds in himself an inexplicable anger, a rage, that prevents the mother&amp;rsquo;s dream of delicate man from becoming real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how difficult it is to become a conscious father and a conscious mother.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>son didn&amp;rsquo;t save his mother. He failed to replace his father and so father is in shame, but the son is in guilt.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>a traditional strategy, when one feels too much guilt, is to bite off one part of your body, and throw it behind you. A man in guilt man decide to fail during the first half of his life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Some men who fail to rescue their mothers become therapist, and some attempt to rescue a woman over and over.&lt;/strong> They bite off the finger of their emotions, and listen to other people&amp;rsquo;s emotions the rest of their lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>His masculine beauty does not come out, and the &lt;strong>rigid boundaries, the angry boy inside, the dead King, the robotlike interior soldiers, throw his family and his wife into despair&lt;/strong>. His mother did not protect him from his father, as he sees it, and his father did not protect him from his mother. In that state, the two &lt;strong>hemispheres of his brain do not commune well with each other.&lt;/strong> He does not know what his feelings are, they do not come up into words.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>such a man needs &lt;strong>a male mother, in this world or the eternal world, to whom he can bring his three-legged horse and from whom he can receive a horse with all four legs&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-festival-of-golden-apples">The Story: Festival of Golden Apples&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Living in the marvelous opposites of the midbrain, its dreamlike furies, its secret defenses of passion, its heightened adrenaline-inspired bloow flow, a man can give spirit to the world, protect the community, and be in passion himself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ability to fight well, as well to dance - wholehearted intent to be in the world, is not savory when the man can imagine another person only as enemy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gave him a leg wound with the end of his sword.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Men invigorated by warrior energy need the ability to modulate out of the warrior mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-golden-apples">The Golden Apples&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the apple associates with immortality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Celts imagined paradise to be an apple orchard in the West where death is.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ritual banquets used to begin with the egg of the east and apple of the west.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Apple is the earth and pentangle (apple sliced transversly) is its secret configuration and sign for Holy Women or Sophia - the soul of the earth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="threshold-space">Threshold Space&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Protestantism has spread its ignorance of ritual space everywhere in the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dionysian initiation work took place in exquisitely maintained ritual space. Greek tragic theater amounts to a transfer of this elaborate ritual space to a public event.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In ritual space our desire energy does not rush forward towards its climax, whether that be orgasm or battle, but delight replaces fury, and a turn of phrase or a turn of symbol replaces the turn of the sword.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Culture beings very likely with baskets made of reeds that are &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; and hold emptiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In ritual space we learn to experience emptiness or the longing and not to fill it.&lt;/strong> Such a man can be in the presence of innocence without moving to have sexual intercourse with it, enjoy his fierceness without acting it out physically, know his mother&amp;rsquo;s neediness without moving to satisfy it. A warrior can enjoy the beauty of his sacred warriorhood without engaging in battle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>is there to be seen, to display.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blake called the highest stage of consciousness &amp;ldquo;constant creativity&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Shining City of Art&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>The golden apple lets one into the paradise of form.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The heron or the peacock and the deer &lt;strong>express in their vivid outrageous display what the absence of shame is like.&lt;/strong> Blake: &amp;ldquo;The pride of the peacock is the glory of God&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To be without a supportive father is for a man an alternative phrase for &amp;ldquo;to be in shame.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only &lt;strong>when a man&amp;rsquo;s interior warrior are strong enough can he go into the joy of display and enter the delight of form.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shapeless clothing, verse that is sloppy, chaotic furnishings: all are linked in secret ways to shame. The universe is not ashamed, and it delights in form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The delight in form, then, moves one away from old duality of hero and enemy, right and wrong.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a man or woman enters ritual space, each takes actions meant to be seen, and the joy of display helps pull energy away that would otherwise be invested in conflict.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The knights who parade before the King&amp;rsquo;s stands, patiently waiting to receive a &amp;ldquo;golden apple&amp;rdquo;, are lovely emblems of the &lt;strong>new stage in which the infinitive &lt;em>to win&lt;/em> fades and is replaces be the infinitive &amp;ldquo;to be seen&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ritual space, headed by the Holy Feminine and the King, becomes hot enough to allow change.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>We try these days to move young men by compulsory education directly from childhood into the White Knight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Saint George was riding a white horse. Man can have relationship to the dragon - doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply killing him - distorted version of original myth. In some old versions the dragon transforms into a woman, or gives treasure. The dragon is not evil, he&amp;rsquo;s dark water-energy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Celtic hero gets into relationship with dragon by throwing loaves of bread into his mouth - he has to throw accurately, so we can say precision and skills enters white.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a man hasn&amp;rsquo;t lived through the red stage, he is a stuck white knight who will setup a false war with some concretized dragon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Black horse - decisive descent into woundedness,&lt;/strong> and is often wounded &amp;ldquo;by the King&amp;rsquo;s men&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People who are in black usually give up blame.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>young male moves from red intensity to white engagement to black humanity. Each man is given three horses that we ride at various times of our lives; we fall off and get back on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teacher and parents tell us to skip the red horse. Such a man then will have to go back to red later, learn to flare up, and be obnoxious when he is forty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Black - bringing all of the shadow material, which has been for years projected out there. &lt;strong>Retrieving and eating the shadow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A man who goes into the black has to &amp;ldquo;walk the rest of the way&amp;rdquo;. It takes a long time to move into the black. When the man finds the dark parts of him he threw away, and retrieves them, other people will begin to trust him.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When he&amp;rsquo;s able to ride the black horse, it will carry him to the place where King&amp;rsquo;s men wound him. At that moment golden hair falls down over his shoulders&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>In old Mediterranean and Mesopotamian cultures, vegetation was assumed to be male. The earth lives forever; the &amp;ldquo;vegetable world&amp;rdquo; dies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The boar, with his curved moon-tusk, have Adonis a wound in the genital area, and that wound was fatal.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tusk has a beautiful curve, like a breaking wave, or the new moon, or the harvester&amp;rsquo;s scythe.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pig was the earliest domesticated animal, and was succeeded by a layer of sheep and for some cattle culture.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Margaret Walker in &lt;em>Encyclopedia of Women&amp;rsquo;s Myths and Secrets&lt;/em>: Adonis: Greek version of Semitic Adonai, &amp;ldquo;The Lord,&amp;rdquo; a castrated and sacrificed savior-god whose love-death united him with Aphrodite, or Asherah, or Mari. In Jerusalem, his name was Tammuz&amp;hellip; Another form of the same god as Anchises, castrated: &amp;ldquo;gored in the groin&amp;rdquo; by Aphrodite&amp;rsquo;s boar-masked priest. His severed phallus became his &amp;ldquo;son,&amp;rdquo; the ithyphallic god Priapus, identified with Eros in Greece &amp;hellip; Castrating the god was linked to reaping the grain, which Adonis personified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Abraham stopped the sacrifice of Isaac, which was going on for centuries presumably.&lt;/strong> At that time Palestine was in sheep culture, so a ram was substitute instead.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>There are men who do not survive an encounter with the negative side of the Great Mother, and there are men who do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the fight takes place under the care of old men - the grandfathers - the boar attack only leaves s scar. The man himself remains alive, and, when old, is cunning like Odysseus and full of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mythologically, Odysseus unites in himself the adventuresome young man, the &amp;ldquo;puer&amp;rdquo; and the steady old man, the &amp;ldquo;senex.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ulysses&amp;rsquo; name, becomes literally &amp;ldquo;thight wound&amp;rdquo;. He receives wound and lives.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When Odysseus returns secretly to Ithaca, he stays in swine herder&amp;rsquo;s hut (pigs again).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Distinction between the boar wound that takes the boy to paradise and the boar wound that leaves him with a scar on his thigh. If we have that scar, our &amp;ldquo;old nurse&amp;rdquo; can recognize us. Our own eyesight apparently is also clearer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We know Odysseus was the initiated man - he is &amp;ldquo;the thirtheenth&amp;rdquo; in his band when they visit Circe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If one has no scars, one becomes blind in the next world, but perhaps the man without scars is also blind in the imaginative world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Odysseus gives evidence that the scar helps him see and escape all the dangers (e.g. Circe turning his man into pigs - again).&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The old initiators make the young man, through the ritual space, double-hearted. &lt;strong>Now the man has a physical heart he has always had, but also a compassionate heart.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-asking-for-the-bride">The Story: Asking for the Bride&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The man in earth time would be about fifty years old now, or older. Some flower has finally unfolded and blossomed; the golden salmon have laid their eggs; the young man has received through his descent a grounding that allows him to reconnect with some creativity that would have frightened him when he was younger.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life in a family takes that assurance (of glory) out of one fast; and each of us goes through a shaming time or deprivation time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Eventually at fifty, or fifty-five, we feel a golden ring on the finger again.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-wild-man-and-his-qualities">The Wild Man and His Qualities&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rudeness and sarcasm may be savage, but the unexpected is not savage.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The wild man represents the positive side of male sexuality. He&amp;rsquo;s not been clean shaven out of shame and his instincts have not been suppressed as to produce the rage that humiliates women.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wild Man&amp;rsquo;s sexuality does not feed on the feminine or pictures of the feminine, it resonates also to hills, clouds, and ocean.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Apollo, Hermes, the Virgin may be above nature, but the Wild Man is nature.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Wild Man encourages and amounts to a trust in what is below. &amp;ldquo;Water prefers low places&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desires for the infinite, for the Woman at the Edge of the Word, for the Firebird, for the treasure at the bottom of the sea, desires entirely superfluous.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We need to build a body, but not on parallel bars, but an activated, emotional body strong enough to contain our own superfluous desires.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Wild Man can come only to full life inside the man when he has gone through serious disciplines suggested by taking first wound, doing the kitchen and ashes work, creating a garden, bringing wild flowers to the Holy Woman, experiencing the warrior, riding the red, white and black horses. Learning to create art and receiving a second heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>He doesn&amp;rsquo;t come to full live being &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;, going with the flow, smoking weed, reading nothing and generally being groovy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ecstasy amounts to living within reach of the high voltage of the golden gifts. The ecstasy comes after thought, after discipline imposed on ourselves, after grief.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Wild man prepares matter, emotional body, so he can receive grief, ecstasy, spirit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rumi: &amp;ldquo;everyone who is calm and sensible is insane&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wild Man&amp;rsquo;s energy is that energy which is conscious of a wound. His face and body contains grief, knows grief, shares grief with nature.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hard survivor in us survived to adulthood. Wild Man leads the return to the place of childhood abuse and abandonment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Wild Man is better guide to that pain as our inner child, because he&amp;rsquo;s not a child. He knows stories and can lead us into personal suffering and through it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wild Man&amp;rsquo;s qualities, among them love of spontaneity, association wild wilderness, honoring grief, respect for riskiness, frightens many people.&lt;/strong> Some men, as soon they receive first impulses to riskiness and recognize its link to the Wild Man, become frightened, stop all wildness and recommend collective behaviour and timidity to others. Some of these men become high school principals, some sociologists, some businessmen, Protestant ministers, bureaucrats, therapist; some become poets and artists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a man doesn&amp;rsquo;t descend to the kitchen, he won&amp;rsquo;t know ashes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not want ordinary life; they prefer possibility of intensity, even though it entails risk of failure or insanity, preferring it to the &amp;ldquo;even-tempered life promised to the good servant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aim is not to be the Wild Man, but to be in touch with him.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-community-inside-the-psyche">The Community Inside the Psyche&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wild Man lives in complicated interchanges with other interior beings. A whole community of beings is what is called a grown man.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>King.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warrior.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lover.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wild Man - who energizes this whole story.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tricker - does not go with the flow but reverses it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mythologist or Cook - knows how long cooking should go on, and how to move from one stage to another. Also called &lt;strong>Magician or Magus. Shaman at the highest level. Deals with energies in the invisible world.&lt;/strong> When the emotional body is severely crippled in the childhood, the Magician might survive. Pure intellectual energy not as damaged by emotions figures things out and ascends to keep sane. Perhaps Magician&amp;rsquo;s wise ascension is the way naive man gets born. The Magician is then a great blessing. He moves behind the screen of our story invisibly, sending the young man on to garden, for example, no matter what the King says.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Grief Man. Special figure in men who leads them down into one of their great strengths - the power to grieve. There is a grief in men that has no cause. Our culture gets very little permission to grieve.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Teachers and therapist often have a strong Cook, Mythologist or Magician inside.&lt;/strong> But if Wild Man is not developed, he will become an &amp;ldquo;academic&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>If a therapist doesn&amp;rsquo;t dive down to meet the Wild Man, he will try to heal with words.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Grief Man without the Wild Man can become lost in the labyrinth of childhood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a man inherits great warrior energy but does not incorporate Wild Man, he might sacrifice other but not know whom he is to be sacrificed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the Wild Man is not strong part of the Trickster, the Trickster may reverse all flows but have none of his own.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a Lover lacks the Wild Man, he may not give enough wild flowers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>King without enough Wild Man will be king for human beings, but animals, oceans, trees will have no representation in his Senate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-story-the-wedding-feast">The Story: The Wedding Feast&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the despised and lowly becomes honored, the being that is apparently primitive becomes a king.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some invisible force that we know nothing about has put the sophisticated energy of this being into a primitive form and shape, as if into a cage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Such &lt;strong>initiation does not take place at any one movement or only once. It happens over and over.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The initiatory road in our story includes eight segments, but another story may offer the same stages in different order, or entirely different stages.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is any one right order of initiation. We go through the round of experiences over and over - at first lightly, then as we get older, more deeply.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A man whose Warrior or Lover has been damaged is already farthest from women. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t be farther.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;A strong power forced me by enchantment to live under the water until a young man appeared who was ready to undergo the discipline and go through the suffering that you have gone through. Now that you have done that, I can appear as I am - a Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ancient man and women see through a veil to a firm, invisible being on the other side of the screen of nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lord of Animals or the Releaser of Animals, crossed the line from animals&amp;rsquo; side of things to the human side.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a compact was made sometime in the past between the human realm and animal realm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord of Animals has been associated with the initiation of young men for at least fourteen thousand years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In our industrial system we ignore Great Mother and Lord of the Animals. We are some of the first people in history who have tried to live without honoring him and his depth, his woundedness, his knowledge of appropriate sacrifice.&lt;/strong> As a result, our sacrifices have become unconscious, regressive, pointless, indiscriminate, self-destructive and massive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-agricultural-era">The Agricultural Era&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the Indian subcontinent the Lord of Animals transforms in such a way as to become Shiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dravidian culture, that was prior the Hindu culture, gave him the name Pashupati and Parvati to his companion, the Lady of the Mountain. Immense philosophical and religious movement around the Lord of the Animals enters classical Indian literature as Shivaism, which merged with earlier animism.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dravidian language shares many words with Sumerian, Basque, Georgian languages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shiva keeps wild aspect, but has also an ascetic aspect, a husbandly side, and enraged or Bhairava side.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord of the Animals in the area around Caucasus, Thessaly, Greece and Crete expands into the god called Zagreus, Zan, Zeus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cretans named Lord of Animals Zagreus and the Lady of the Mountain Cybele. The bull, the snake and the phallus speak for Zagreus or Zeus, the tiger and the lion speak for Cybele.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As Cretan culture developed, the birth rituals of baby Zeus on Mount Ida and Mount Dicte began to merge with the rituals around the baby Dionysus (who came directly from the thigh of Zeus).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As mankind moves toward the mystery of plants, the Lord of Animals can change while still keeping his sacrificial essence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dionysus is the clump of grapes which when torn apart, trampled, enclosed in the darkness of an ox hide, gives to everyone in the community an ecstasy - a wine. Sufis: &amp;ldquo;Nothing can be sole or whole / That has not been rent&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>gr:tragedy = song of the (sacrificed) goat.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dionysus carries knowledge that comes to the soul when it broods on tearing and being torn.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In Celtic societies of ancient Europe Wild Man appears as Cernunnos, Cornely, or Cornelius, emphasizing stag horns. In some Celtic lands he is known as Herne the Hunter, whose hunting dogs are white with red ears.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visualization of Cernunnos found in Jutland known as Gundestrup Cauldron from first century BC. Cernunnos is seen sitting in yoga posture, holding a serpent in one hand and the Lady&amp;rsquo;s neck ring in the other, allowing stag horns and leaves to rise from his head. Al l around him is a company made of dolphin, gazelle, lion and dog. Celtic Arthurian circle keeps memories of him, e.g. in Yvain, where he is named Lord of the Animals and Guardian of the Fountain. Cernunno&amp;rsquo;s female companion has many names, among them Artio - who root she shares with Arthur - meaning &amp;ldquo;female bear&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene - carries some of the feeling of &lt;strong>light hidden in darkness, which we associate with Sophia.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sophia and Dionysus contain in their legends the secret of a sun that does not shine from the sun down, but rather a sun deep in earth which shines toward us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Development of the Forest Lord stops dead around A.D 1100. As Wild Man, he is remembered of course in literature and folk imagination.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>When a young king, Gilgamesh, golden, inflated, greedy for pleasure, beings to cause trouble, the elders say the only solution is to bring him in touch with the man called Enkidu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enkidu travels to the city, meets Gilgamesh; the two wrestle, Enkidu wins, and the two become inseparable friends. Enkidu appears a s a hairy shadow of the new civilized city king.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tale of Esau (Bible) implies that at a certain point in Near Eastern history the hairy main was exiled or disenfranchised.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dante began his famous, fabulous descent into the underworld with the recognition that midway in life he found himself in a dark wood, having lost his way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aeschylus, the first great tragedian, observed that gods ordained a solemn decree that from &lt;strong>suffering alone comes wisdom.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the words soul and psyche interchangeably.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mystery in which our journey plays out:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the immense cosmos through which we are flung at warp velocity,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ambient nature, which is our home and our context,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>each proximate other who brings the challenge of relationship, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our own elusive, insurgent Self, forever asking, insisting, not to be forgotten.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A life that constricts meaning wounds the soul&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore equivalent to illness.&lt;/strong> Meaning makes a great many things endurable - perhaps everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung once observed that one can travel no further with another than one has traveled on one&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>inexplicably, &lt;strong>it is the soul itself that has brought us to that difficult place in order to enlarge us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>individuation, that is, the lifelong project of becoming more nearly the whole person we were meant to be - what the gods intended, not the parents, or the tribe, or especially, the easily intimidated or inflated ego.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Self is the embodiment of nature&amp;rsquo;s plan for us, or the will of the gods.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we are in the service to the Self, we can seldom be in service to the herd as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the process of individuation must lead to more intense and broader collective relationship and not isolation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In most lives, permission to live one&amp;rsquo;s life is not something one is given; it is to be seized.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Does this path enlarge or diminish me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> We know the answer intuitively, instinctively, in the gut.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>each of us is obliged to find our personal path through the dark wood. &lt;strong>In the medieval Grail legend the knights, having seen the Grail, and intuiting that it symbolized their search for meaning, undertook to challenge and began their descent into the dark wood. But the text tells us that each one choose a separate place of entry &amp;ldquo;where there was no path, for it is a shameful thing to take the path that someone else has trod before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-one-expensive-ghosts-how-did-we-get-to-this-point">Chapter One: Expensive Ghosts: How did we get to this point?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Paul Hoover (Theory of Margins): &amp;ldquo;We drag expensive ghosts through memory&amp;rsquo;s unmade bed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we have not had such moments of genuine confusion, perplexity, and doubt, chances are we&amp;rsquo;re simply living on automatic pilot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our greatest sin may be choosing to remain unconscious.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As Shakespeare observed in Twelfth Night, no prisons are more confining than those we know not we are in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the presence of suffering is already manifestation of the psyche at work.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A young person can&amp;rsquo;t afford such questions, which threaten to erode the ego&amp;rsquo;s fragile structure. But by midlife, one may finally be strong enough, or desperate enough, to ask these questions in a committed fashion.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="thee-silent-passage-into-the-second-life">Thee Silent Passage into the Second Life&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever &amp;ldquo;The plan&amp;rdquo; of their lives was, conscious or unconscious, it progressively seemed to not be working too well.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-midlife-crisis">The Midlife Crisis?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One has to have separated from the parents long enough to be in the world, to make choices, to see what works, what does not, and to experience the collapse, or at least erosion of one&amp;rsquo;s projections.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-it-begins">How It Begins&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The psyche is always speaking, and its urges will manifest as &lt;strong>ennui, the more conscious boredom, then inner resistance to our conscious scripts, and, as we continue to turn deaf ears, finally as eruption of invasive feelings and behaviours&lt;/strong>: interrupted sleep or eating habits, the lure of an affair, troubling dreams, self-medicating addictions, and so on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We experience the unavoidable conflict between the natural Self and the acquired &amp;ldquo;sense of self&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The most common characteristic of this kind of passage, is the &lt;strong>deconstruction of &amp;ldquo;the false self&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is quite natural to cling to the known world and fear the unknown.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>is it not self-deluding, then to keep doing the same thing but expecting different results?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As Jung once put it humorously, &lt;strong>we all walk in shoes too small for us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The person in the grip of this unconscious agenda cannot see that the outer woman is surrogate for his inner life, which has been neglected these many years. &lt;strong>The problem with the unconscious is that it is unconscious.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: I&amp;rsquo;ve frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life. They seek position, marriage, reputation, outward success or money, and they remain unhappy and neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking. Such people are usually contained within too narrow a spiritual horizon. Their life has not sufficient content, sufficient meaning. If they are enabled to develop into more spacious personalities, the neurosis generally disappears.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is generally through the experience of unsolicited suffering that we grow larger, not because the unexamined life proved easier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What we have ignored or denied inwardly will then more likely come out to us as outer fate.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-two-becoming-who-we-think-we-are">Chapter Two: Becoming Who We Think We Are&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Garden of Eden: Partaking of the Tree of Life is to abide forever int he world of instinct - whole, connected and living the deepest of rhythms without consciousness. Partaking of the Tree of Knowledge brings the mixed blessing of consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The birth is also the birth of neurosis, so to speak, because from that moment on we are in service to twin agendas - the biological and the spiritual drive to develop.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Twin gremlins of fear and lethargy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The way forward threatens death - at the very least, the death of what has been familiar.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People attack gays for stirring unconscious insecurities about their own sexual identities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The daily confrontation with these gremlins of fear and lethargy obliges us to choose between anxiety and depression. &lt;strong>Anxiety will be our companion if we risk the next sage of our journey and depression will be if we do not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogi Berra: When you come to a fork in the road - take it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>psychological or &lt;strong>spiritual development always requires a greater capacity in us for the toleration of anxiety and ambiguity.&lt;/strong> The capacity to accept this troubled state, abide it, and commit to life, is the moral measure of our maturity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Anxiety is an elixir, and depression a sedative.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: &amp;ldquo;The spirit of evil is fear, negation &amp;hellip; the spirit of regression, who threatens us with bondage to the mother and with dissolution and extinction in the unconscious.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong>Mother symbolizes the safe and sheltering harbor: the old job, the familiar warm arms, and the same unchallenged, and stultifying, value system.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="why-the-tragic-sense-of-life-matters-to-us">Why the Tragic Sense of Life Matters to Us&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>our ancestors believed that we often &amp;ldquo;offend the gods&amp;rdquo;, that is, violate energic designs of which they are dramatized personifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one possessed by Ares will act out of unreasoned anger, with all its attendant consequences. Accordingly, they believed that by &amp;ldquo;reading&amp;rdquo; the texture of one&amp;rsquo;s life, one can identify the ignored or repressed archetypal powers, the gods offended, and offer homage and compensatory behaviours to them to resolve the balance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>At birth, each of us handed lens by our family of origin, our culture, our Zeitgeist through which to see the world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Right relationship with the gods&amp;rdquo; as a psychological concept means that we harmonize our concious life with the deepest powers that govern the cosmos and course through our own souls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>(Is not this deepened journey of the soul, in fact, our &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;?). The tragic sense of life, then is not morbid but rather heroic, for it is a summons to consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who ignores this summons will suffer the wrath of the gods, the splitting of the soul we call neurosis.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="existential-wounding-and-the-programming-of-our-sense-of-self">Existential Wounding and the Programming of Our Sense of Self&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Magical thinking results from an insufficient ability to differentiate self and world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lacking other &amp;ldquo;readings&amp;rdquo; of the world, it is natural fora child to conclude: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m as I&amp;rsquo;m treated&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-wound-of-overwhelmment">The Wound of Overwhelmment&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Given the message that the world is larger, more powerful, we may logically try to evade its potential punitive effect upon us by retreating, procrastinating, hiding out, denying, dissociating.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have seen people marry someone they did not love because they felt unable to approach the one they did love, because they had reflexively imbued that other with such transferred powerfulness that they were afraid to approach them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second logical response to overwhelmment is found in our frequent &lt;strong>efforts to seize control of the situation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The world is hurtful and invasive. You must hurt or invade first, or be hurt and invaded instead&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We may pursue education, because to understand is to be in control&lt;/strong>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Their &lt;strong>urgent desire for power is a measure of their inner powerlessness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accommodation&lt;/strong> is a learned response, sometimes even necessary for civilization to survive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We say someone is &amp;ldquo;sweet,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;personable,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;amiable,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;easygoing,&amp;rdquo; and most often &amp;ldquo;nice.&amp;rdquo; When these labels repeatedly apply to someone&amp;rsquo;s behaviour the consequences to the person&amp;rsquo;s inner life may be in fact ugly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Codependence is predicated on one&amp;rsquo;s reflexive assumption of powerlessness&lt;/strong> and the inordinate power of the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learning to find one&amp;rsquo;s own truth, to hold it, to negotiate with others seems easy enough on paper.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-wound-of-insufficiency">The Wound of Insufficiency&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the unconscious equation is &amp;ldquo;I am as I am treated by others&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>something in us does dream, and brings an invitation to consciousness, to risk embodying a larger sense of self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>what one lacks within one will seek in the outer world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many marriages are in the service to the hidden agenda of the less psychologically evolved of the two?&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any reflexive response to stress and anxiety, whether conscious or not, is a form of addiction. The chief motive of any addiction is, of course, to help one not feel what in fact one has already been feeling. Breaking the tyranny of the addiction will require one to feel the pain that the addiction defends against.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever we&amp;rsquo;re fatigued, stressed, or whenever conscious control is lessened, these old patterns are especially prone to reactivation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Seldom are we wholly present to this moment, this ever-new reality, without interference of the past.&lt;/strong>

&lt;li>It is far easier to talk in the shoes too small for us than to step into the largeness that the soul expects and demands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of us are brought into therapy on our knees, or at best in a state of disorientation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A formal, committed therapeutic relationship provides a deeper, more objective, more informed conversation with oneself, through the engagement of another person who has our interest at heart.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The invitation to meet oneself is seldom if ever solicited; it is rather brought on by outer or inner events that force one to question who one is, and in service to what values.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>None of us is pleased to encounter the &lt;strong>false self, the necessary fictions in which we invest, until even we can no longer believe them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Grieving is an honest affirmation of the value of the original investment of energy.&lt;/strong> No grief, no true investment occurred.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people in therapy have learned that &lt;strong>the way out of a depression is through it, asking not what I, the ego consciousness, want, but what the soul wants.&lt;/strong> Only the reorienting conscious energies in service to other values will lift the depression.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anxiety must be chosen over depression, for it is developmental and depression is regressive.&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="relationship-as-field-of-fire">Relationship As Field of Fire&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the field of outer relationship is always troubled when we are troubled within.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>it is much easier to blame our partners, or try to reform them, or leave them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="projections-eroded-projections-renewed">Projections Eroded, Projections Renewed?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Projections always pass through five identifiable stages:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>At the onset they feel magical; they literally alter our sense of reality. We are seeing some unknown part of ourselves in the exterior world&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second stage begets disillusionment. The other does not carry through as expected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We begin to do whatever we can to reinforce the projection, to recover its pristine attraction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To suffer the withdrawal of the projection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if we reach this point at all, is to become that a projection has occurred.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every failed projection is quantum of energy, our energy, an agenda for growth or healing, and a task that has come back to us.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="jobs-abrogated-contract">Job&amp;rsquo;s Abrogated Contract&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>a deal is a presumption of the ego in service to its now familiar agenda, which promotes its own security, satiety, and continuity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Robert Frost: &lt;em>Forgive, O Lord, my little joke on thee, And I&amp;rsquo;ll forgive thy great big one on me.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This betrayal by the other&lt;/strong> - by God, by our lover, by our friend, by the corporation - &lt;strong>is a betrayal of our hope that the world might be manageable and predictable&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our presumptive &lt;strong>contracts are delusory efforts by the ego to be in control&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world is more magical, less predictable, more autonomous, less controllable, more varied, less simple, more infinite, less knowable, more wonderfully troubling than we could have imagined being able to tolerate when we were young.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="competing-agendas">Competing Agendas&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If &lt;strong>the agenda of the first half of life is social, meeting the demands and expectations our milieu asks of us,&lt;/strong> then &lt;strong>the questions of the second half of life are spiritual, addressing the larger issues of the meaning&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The psychology of the first half of life is driven by the fantasy of acquisition.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the ego prevails, change is forestalled, and spiritual stagnation, even regression, sooner or later occurs.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-four-barriers-to-transformation">Chapter Four: Barriers to Transformation&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>W. H. Auden (The Age of Anxiety): &amp;ldquo;We would rather be ruined than changed, We would rather die in our dread Than climb the cross of the present And let our illusions die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we must recall that the &lt;strong>central, universal message of the world to the child is: &amp;ldquo;I am big and you&amp;rsquo;re not; I am powerful and you&amp;rsquo;re not; now find a way to deal with that.&amp;rdquo; Whatever stratagem we evolve &amp;ndash; approach/avoidance; trust/distrust; fight/flight; control/placate &amp;ndash; has a tendency to get locked in as a core relational paradigm for self and world, a reflexive strategy for survival and means for getting one&amp;rsquo;s needs met.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is essential that we not judge ourselves, for we cannot be blamed for choices we made as children.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A complex is a cluster of energy in the unconscious, charged by historic events, reinforced through repetition, and generating a programmed response and an implicit set of expectations.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Folk wisdom has long recognized the presence and power of complexes in such homey sayings as, &amp;ldquo;Count twenty before you say something&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Write the letter but wait a week before you send it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I&amp;rsquo;m not my ego state, then who am I?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>when a complex is at work, there is always some seizing up of the body - a constricted throat, flutter in the stomach, sweating palms&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A complex takes place when an unconscious stimulus is received.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>historically generated but invisible clusters of energy are activated over and over that patterns &lt;strong>(complexes) form in our lives, patterns which seemingly have a life of their own and are seldom consciously chosen. For this reason, our ancestors speculated that the hand of an offended divinity was at work.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A person in the first half of life is so swarming with the power of these unconscious forces&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Zen saying: &amp;ldquo;Everywhere you go, there you are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;the middle passage&amp;rdquo; occurs only when a person begins to discern that his or her repetitions, compensations, and treatment plans for life have their origin not in conscious life but in unconscious history.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ixion: the wheel of repetition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>St Paul: while we may intend the good, we seldom do it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>lethargy - Lethe, the river of forgetfulness&lt;/strong> in the classical topography of the underworld. Forgetting that we are summoned by each moment to make life-defining choices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perhaps to &lt;strong>greatest addictions in our culture do not include street drugs, but are television and food.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blaise Pascal noted that popular culture has become a vast divertissement, a &lt;strong>diversion from the engagement with the Self. Even the king had to have his jester&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our age, where &lt;strong>lethargy of the spirit&lt;/strong> is merchandised by very intelligent people and lulls all of us into the &lt;strong>sleep of reason,&lt;/strong> and the &lt;strong>slumber of the spirit.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Growing up, leaving home, require two practices.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>we must take responsibility for ourselves, and stop blaming others:&lt;/strong> the society, the parents, the partner, the malevolent gods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>we have to look within to see the repetitive core ideas, the complexes, and the historic influence where the true enemy lies.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rumi mused: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>A king sent you to a country to carry one special, specific task. You go to the country and you perform a hundred other tasks, but if you have not performed the task you were sent for, it is as if you have performed nothing at all. So man has come into the world for a particular task and that is his purpose. If he doesn&amp;rsquo;t perfdorm it, he will have done nothing.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-five-the-dynamics-of-intimate-relationship">Chapter Five: The Dynamics of Intimate Relationship&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rumi (&amp;ldquo;Sometimes I Forget&amp;rdquo;): &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Sometimes I forget completely What companionship is. Unconscious and insane, I spill sad energy everywhere.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Of all the ideologies that possess the contemporary soul, perhaps none is more powerful, more seductive, and possibly more delusory than the romantic fantasy that there is someone out there who is right for us, the long-sought soul mate, what I call &amp;ldquo;the magical other&amp;rdquo;, the one who will truly understand us, take care of us, meet our needs, repair the wounds, and, with a little luck, spare us the burden of growing up and meeting our own needs.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>its chief rival: the fantasy that material goods will bring us happiness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In earlier epochs the notion that one might find fulfillment in this life was considered laughable, even impious. This world, our predecessors believed, was a &amp;ldquo;vale of tears&amp;rdquo; and could only be compensated by an afterlife.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is far easier to be disappointed in the other than to call ourselves to account.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-psychodynamics-of-relationship">The Psychodynamics of Relationship&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All relationships begin in projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As historically charged creatures, we have a tendency to transfer those historical patterns, and their predicable outcomes, into every new relationship.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Either &lt;strong>choice is dictated by the unmetabolized events of the childhood.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we are sincere, and really do wish to &lt;strong>improve relationships&lt;/strong>, as so many popular books and magazines claim, we may usefully &lt;strong>ask: &amp;ldquo;What do we project, and what do we transfer onto the other person?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An &lt;strong>imago is a very deeply charged image.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our intrapsychic imago of the beloved other will most commonly have been shaped by our most primal experiences of relationships. This imago most likely derives from our experience of our parents.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the surest evidence that a complex-ridden imago is in charge is the ready availability of a rationalization to justify it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This search, this fantasy, is the &lt;strong>chief fuel for our culture - the fantasy of romantic love&lt;/strong>, the fantasy that there is this other who will make our life work for us, heal us, protect us, nurture us, and spare us the world&amp;rsquo;s trauma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mere presence, appearance, or context of person B can activate the unconscious of person A, triggering a projection, with its attendant transferential history. When this engagement occurs, powerful emotion, be it attraction or repulsion is activated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not only do individuals relate to each other in these powerful but unconscious ways, but so do groups and even nations&lt;/strong>, often with tragic, repetitive outcomes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When two parties are caught in a mutual projection, they may have strong repulsion to each other or strong attraction.&lt;/strong> When however, this projection is of &lt;strong>attraction, a strong desire to merge with that other occurs.&lt;/strong> This projective identification is called &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;romance&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Folk wisdom observes that lovers are fools, lovers are blind;&lt;/strong> we also speak of a folie a deux because in this mutually projective state, the person is acting not out of a conscious relationship to reality, but out of archaic and often overwhelming power of personal history.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Behind our projections, is surprise, surprise, a mere human being like us. Whoever they are, whatever they are, their imperfect reality will inevitably wear through the projection until a different picture emerges.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rarely does one truly analyze the phenomenon and discern the humbling truth, that some dynamic, script, expectation, or project from our consciousness has been unwittingly projected onto the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The weaker the consciousness of a person is, the more he or she is likely to get fixated in the projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spousal violence similarly derives from the failure to honor the reality of the other when it does not conform to projective expectations. &lt;strong>A weak ego can only tolerate discrepancy by resorting to violence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Violent men don&amp;rsquo;t have the strength of consciousness and character to own responsibility for what is missing in their own psychological life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it is virtually impossible to do therapy with a person &amp;ldquo;in love&amp;rdquo;, just as one cannot work with a drunk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We find ourselves repelled by a stranger, a character in a sitcom, and for what reason?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generally speaking, &lt;strong>whatever moves us, whatever consciously or not, will somehow be found as touching a deeply buried aspect of ourselves.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The much greater risk of truly loving the other presents a quite different agenda, a more demanding summons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the other does not conform to our relationship agenda, we often seek to control them through admonishment, withdrawal, passive/aggressive sabotage, and sometimes overtly controlling behaviours. We profess innocence when confronted for we usually believe our own rationalizations.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;we wish to colonize the other,&amp;rdquo; and like most imperial powers, we are flush to rationalizations to justify our agendas of self-interest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;What am I asking of my beloved that I need to do for myself?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Difficulty of couple&amp;rsquo;s therapy is getting each party to look rigorously at the psychodynamics they bring to their disagreement without continuing to blame each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The failed projection is experienced by the ego as a frustration and a defeat.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>inescapable truth of any relationship is that it can achieve no higher level of development than the level of maturity that both parties bring to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is not a fault to have a childish region of our psyche, for we are all recovering children, but it is a culpable act to impose that disempowered, narcissitically driven history on the present beloved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What another really can bring to us, their greatest gift, is not an imitation or confirmation of our limited vision, but the gift of their quite different vision, their otherness as otherness. The immature psyche needs confirmation to be secure, a cloning of interests and sensibilities, and there is no surer path to staying immature and undeveloped than seeking agreement in all things.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A more mature relationship is based on the &amp;ldquo;otherness&amp;rdquo; itself, on the dialectical principle that demonstrates that my one and your one together create the third. This &amp;ldquo;third&amp;rdquo; is the developmental process that results as we influenced each other in turn;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Consciously loving another obliges risk, courage in the face of ambiguity, and the strength of tolerance. Whoever lacks these qualities will never truly have relationship.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that &lt;strong>wholeness only comes through relationship with another. Only in such fashion can the third appear.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The more we wish another person to repair our wounds, meet our needs, and protect us from having to grow up, really grow up, the more dissatisfying the relationship will prove over the long haul.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The problem is not romance, but what extra baggage romance is obliged to carry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>we&amp;rsquo;re asked to confront the essential mystery that we are with the essential that our partner is&lt;/strong>. When we can &lt;strong>tolerate this mystery&lt;/strong>, we are already becoming a larger person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What we fear in ourselves we will fear in the other; what we avoid addressing in ourselves we will avoid in the other; where we are stuck with ourselves we will be stuck with the other.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>constant companion of Eros is pathos, desire and suffering are twins.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the cure for loneliness is solitude&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without Eros, the life force, pulling us into the world, we would all stay home and perish.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>engagement of the soul&amp;rsquo;s agenda is our real task, this journey is our real home&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accepting the journey as our home will free the relationship to serve the agenda of life, the agenda of growth, and the agenda of the soul. When we have accepted this journey, truly accepted it, we will be flooded with a strong supportive energy that carries us through all the dark places. For this energy we have an appropriate word. It is called love. It is &lt;strong>love not only for the other, but love o this life, this journey, and love of this task of soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-six-the-family-during-the-second-half-of-live">Chapter Six: The family During the Second Half of Live&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>idea of marriage, with sufficient sanctioned powers to govern and channel the wild swings to which Eros is so often to prone.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>family became the one stable unit in the world of change,&lt;/strong> hostile invasion, depredations of nature, and constant search for food and shelter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: When a situation occurs which corresponds to a given archetype, that archetype becomes activated and a compulsiveness appears, which, like an instinctual drive, gains its way against all reason and will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;How many of my family can I save?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;One&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>marriage and family therapist know that &lt;strong>family interactions are typically arrayed around its most damaged member. Except in the case of a catastrophic illness of a child, that damaged member is inevitably one of the parents,&lt;/strong> and sometimes both of them in their pas de deux.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Of every family we must ask, &amp;ldquo;How well did the soul flourish here; how much life was lost through the failure of modeling a larger life, granting permission to follow one&amp;rsquo;s own course, or was constricted by the glass ceiling of familial fears and limitations?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tostoy (Anna Karenina): &lt;strong>all happy families are happy in similar ways, whereas unhappy families find their unique ways of being unhappy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>having not taken on the journey, remain narcissistic, demanding&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My advice to parents is always the same: Hold your breath - they will finally grow and leave, no doubt blaming you for everything until they find that their problems have followed them. Try to model the fuller life, and such ethical standards as you wish to affirm; give permission to them to be different, to be, that is, who they are; manifest unconditional love while maintaining standards, boundaries, and reasonable expectations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Until they can be wholly responsible for their own journey, and not project it onto the child, such parents are not grown-ups either.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What a terrible &lt;strong>dilemma facing a child: &amp;ldquo;Please my parents and die within, or live my separate journey and lose their love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> Such deformation of the child&amp;rsquo;s unique journey is a kind of &lt;strong>spiritual violence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Robert Frost: &lt;strong>home is where you go and they have to take you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The difficult task is to balance one&amp;rsquo;s own need for personal freedom and personal growth with the needs of others. Failure will ensure burnout, resentment, and depression, which is typically anger turned inward. However great one&amp;rsquo;s sense of responsibility, no good fruit comes from a such contaminated tree.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rather than mellowing, most people become more of that they already are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>guilt that compels compliant behaviours is really anxiety management.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>stand up to the anxiety and be the only adult on the scene, the only one capable of knowing when enough is enough.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I have already told my adult children that I do not expect, nor do I wish, them to take care of me should I become dependent, or even mentally incompetent.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Just as they knew they always had my love, so I know that I always have theirs. We do not have to prove that through some compliant acts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>family is the chief arena for pathologizing of the child.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The modern healthy family posits the nurturance of the individual as its highest value - all the individuals in that family.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>None is there to serve the narcissistic needs of any other. Each is there to support that growth and feel that support in return.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more the family can be a holding environment in which differences are valued rather than suppressed in service to the anxieties of a parent, the more each person will flower.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The parent&amp;rsquo;s first task is personal growth, allied with the conscious assumption of responsibility for the growth of others.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One treats the other as one would wish to be treated in return&lt;/li>
&lt;li>service not to selfish agenda but to the Self, which in turn is service to the soul. &lt;strong>The ultimate test of the family is not whether it provides safety and predictability, but whether or to what degree each person can leave it, freely, and return, freely, as a larger person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-seven-career-versus-vocation">Chapter Seven: Career Versus Vocation&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I always wondered if such parents really thought they were helping their children by enlisting them in their own security needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Freud once noted that &lt;strong>two requisites necessary for sanity: work and love.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>many find that their work drains rather than energizes them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Making a living is the easy part, but far more critical is what liberates us from the limits of our family and cultural history. What values, what ways of critical thinking and discerning evaluation do we possess to enrich our lives? What understanding of history allows us to escape its binding repetitions?&lt;/strong> What personality development and differentiation will we carry with us through all days of our journey?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nietzsche once observed that the &lt;strong>teacher is ill-served whose student do not surpass him.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>unaware of that cause issue when they arrive, &lt;strong>focusing on their emotional state rather than the source of it&lt;/strong>. So often the work of therapy, certainly not to be narrowed to career counseling, is to examine the forces that brought about the original choices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I discovered that I had lost interest in much of the body of knowledge I had acquired and was more keenly focused on where it came from within us, what it activated in us, and what meaning it could have in the conduct of a larger life. I found that I was more interested in the symbolic life than the intellectual life - the symbolic engaging the soul, while the intellect engaged only the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;May God grant your soul no peace.&amp;rdquo; I came to accept as one benefit of that blessing the powers that moved me from a fine career to an even richer vocation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yes, we need to earn a living, support ourselves and those who depend on us, but there is another call to serve, a summons &lt;strong>to serve spiritual enlargement. An that is our true vocation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we are more than economic animals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>most women do not recognize that man have fewer inner choices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What was not modeled in the family of origin, what was not made available in the popular culture, becomes a personal task for each of us in the second half of life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>he had in fact left what he loved, in service to the expectations of parents and spouse, and grown miserable in turn.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If our work does not support our soul, then the soul will exact its butcher&amp;rsquo;s bill elsewhere.&lt;/strong> Wherever the soul&amp;rsquo;s agenda is not served, some pathology will surface in the arena of daily life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We may choose careers, but we do not choose vocation. Vocation chooses us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the first half of life there is a place for ambition, for the driving powers of the ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: &amp;ldquo;We cannot live the afternoon of life according to the program of life&amp;rsquo;s morning - for what was great in the morning will be little at evening, and what in morning was true will at evening have become a life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoreau noted a hundred and sixty years ago that we had grown imprisoned by the abstractions we created. His &lt;strong>longest chapter in Walden is titled, and decries our growing enslavement to, &amp;ldquo;Economics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Contrary to Sartre&amp;rsquo;s bon mot, Hell is not other people; it is ourselves, constrained by the world we have constructed for ourselves, or allowed others to construct of us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the second half of life the ego is periodically summoned to relinquish its identifications wit the values of others, the values received and reinforced by the world around.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the very achievement of ego strength is the source of our hope for something better. We need to be strong enough to examine our lives and make risky changes. A person strong enough to face the &lt;strong>futilities of most desires, the distractions of most cultural values&lt;/strong>, who can give up trying to be well adjusted to a neurotic culture, will find growth and greater purpose after all. &lt;strong>The ego&amp;rsquo;s highest task is to go beyond itself into service, service to what is really desired by the soul rather than the complex-ridden ego or the values of the culture.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>One engages in work because it is meaningful, and if it is not, one changes the work&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being well adjusted is a trivial goal when one factors in the soul. The soul has no interest in social adaptation as such.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hindu scripture: &lt;strong>&lt;em>It is better to do your own duty badly, than to perfectly do another&amp;rsquo;s; you are safe from harm when you do what you should be doing.&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the end, the meaning of our life will be judged not by our peers or their collective expectations, but by our experience of it, and by whatever transcendent source brought us to it in the first place&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meaning is found, over the long haul, through the feeling of rightness within. No one can give that to us, although we may allow others to take it away from us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At such moments of surrender to the soul, we are in the presence of the divine, and in harmony with its intent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>we are here to bring consciousness to brute being.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-eight-the-new-myth-emerging-from-the-psychopathology-of-everyday-life">Chapter Eight: The New Myth Emerging from the Psychopathology of Everyday Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>world where we are bombarded by sensations, driven by addictions, medicated beyond accountability, agitated into constant motion, and further from our selves than ever&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we also had to become psychological, because the spiritually charged images that once linked humanity to nature and to the gods had eroded with the waning powers of tribal mythologies ans sanctified institutions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>four orders of mystery: the transcendent (the gods), the environment (their home in nature), the tribe (the social fabric), and their own psychological grounding (personal identity)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What fills this existential void, this meaning gap, this time between the gods who vanished and the gods not yet arrived (as Heidegger put it) is the stuff of our daily life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our ancestors could seek the relief of their personal and tribal problems by asking which god had been offended and then offering propitiation to reestablish right relationship with that god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A culture without living mythological access to the mysteries is a culture in trouble.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>materialism, hedonism, and narcissism&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without a &amp;ldquo;vertical&amp;rdquo; sense of participation in divinity, humankind is condemned to a sterile, &amp;ldquo;horizontal&amp;rdquo; existence, circling its own absurdity and ending in its own annihilation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being connected to the mystery only comes, Jung suggests, &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;when people feel that they are living the symbolic life, that they are actors in the divine drama&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>fundamentalism and the culture of sensation&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fundamentalism, be it religious or political or psychological, is an anxiety management technique that finesses the nuances of doubt and ambiguity through rigid and simplistic belief systems. If I can persuade myself that the world is perpetually founded on the values of another, culturally limited, less conscious age, then I do not have to address the new subtleties.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>fundamentalism is a form of mental illness that seeks to repress anxiety, ambiguity, and ambivalence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The culture of sensation - pop culture.&lt;/strong> News that runs twenty-four hours create info junkies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A modern Dantean descent into Hell might be defined as taking a good thing, asking too much of it, and being left only with it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The culture of sensation can only produce addiction and broken hopes, just as fundamentalism can only produce rigidity and a very large shadow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Addictions are found in our reflexive, frequently unconscious anxiety-management behaviours.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dreams, the ongoing commentary offered by the Self as to just how things are going and how they might be better.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>all addictions have as their motive anxiety reduction through some form of connection with the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>anxiety is further deepened by the loss of connective mythologies, those charged images that link us to the gods, to nature, to each other, and to ourselves.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it is most commonly through suffering that we are stretched enough to grow spiritually. &lt;strong>The road of continuous ease results in the circular trap of addiction.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similarly, paraphilias have us in their grip&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Desire itself derives from a Latin nautical term which means &amp;ldquo;of the star.&amp;rdquo; To have desire is to have a vector, an intentionality, a direction.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>paraphilias&lt;/strong> of our time, disturbances of desire, include sexual addiction, pornography, substance disorders, and toxic consumerism, which &lt;strong>offer to fill the empty space of the soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Success&amp;rdquo; has become an unquestioned cultural icon.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The difference between an icon and a symbol is that the former contains only its own limited meaning, while the symbol points beyond itself toward a larger ream of mystery.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>T. S. Eliot: in a world of fugitives, the person who is headed in the right direction will appear running away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The erosion of tribal life and linking mythic systems has more and more melted the glue that held us together. &lt;strong>We sit now behind locked doors, in front of glowing cathode tubes, and robotically rehearse our common cultural conditioning.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can be enlarged only when we are exposed to a wider range of images, such as are provided education, travel, learning, dialogue with others, and the soul&amp;rsquo;s frequent visitors.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="living-myths">Living Myths&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>opened a person or a tribe to mystery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A person who dreams of possessing a new object, or a position in life, in order to provide some large measure of happiness, inevitably ends in dissatisfaction. The vitality of the object or position, which unbeknownst to the person is an unconscious aspect of his or her unaddressed agenda, has been spent, and has autonomously reentered the unconscious, where it awaits a new goal upon which to project.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: &lt;strong>People speak of belief when they have lost knowledge.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whenever the level of conscious attention is lowered, perhaps in times of personal or cultural crisis, the tendency of the ego to project what is not addressed in the inner life increases its fascination with the outer -&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>bewitchment - They speak to something deep within us without requiring us to know our own part in them, or pay the price of consciousness and personal responsibility to truly make them ours.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To free ourselves from bewitchment we are obliged to begin to read the world psychologically:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;What is this touching in me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Where does this come from my own history?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Where have I felt this kind of energy before?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Can I see the pattern beneath the surface?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;What is the hidden idea, or complex, that is creating this pattern?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Is there something promising magic, Easy Street, seduction, &amp;lsquo;solution&amp;rsquo; here, when as we know life will always remain raggedy and incomplete?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Am I made larger, or smaller, by this path, this relationship, this decision?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The unconscious fantasy of a child is that in taking care of the other, perhaps fixing them, the child guarantees that other will be there to take care of them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The &amp;ldquo;enemy&amp;rdquo; we face in situations like this is never the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo;; it is the power of history.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the individual human psyche is the arena in which both outer world and inner world meet and are experienced.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is so much easier to be seduced than to assume sole responsibility for our consciousness, for ourselves. This is the deepest &lt;strong>psychopathology of daily life - the routine flight form the summons of the soul&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Being psychological means that one will need to find the new, the personal myth from within.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The greatest gift of depth psychology is returning to us again the possibility of a deep dialogue with this mystery. To be &lt;strong>psychological does not mean that one must enter therapy, although with the right person, that decision can be transformative. It does mean that one ask, much more radically than ever before, what is going on beneath the surface.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>reconnected with our journey, that we found our myth again.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-nine-recovering-mature-spirituality-in-a-material-age">Chapter Nine: Recovering Mature Spirituality in a Material Age&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The recovery of a mature spirituality is one of the most difficult task of our time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We flee from growing up and being wholly responsible for our experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>move from victimhood to participation in the meaning of our journey&lt;/strong>, and to recognize that in all events, even the traumatic, there is an invitation to greater engagement with depth, with mystery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the second half of the life there are two major tasks. The first is the recovery of personal authority.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We believe ourselves conscious agents, when in fact much if not most of the time we&amp;rsquo;re subject to these authority clusters derived from the fortuities of our personal history and the variegated values of our time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>personal authority = to find what is true for oneself and to life it in the world. If it is not lived&lt;/strong>, it is not yet real for us, and we abide in what Satre called &amp;ldquo;bad faith,&amp;rdquo; the &lt;strong>theologian calls &amp;ldquo;sin,&amp;rdquo; the therapist calls &amp;ldquo;neurosis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>task of discovering a personal spirituality&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>confuse the spirit&amp;rsquo;s longing for largeness with familiar institutions, creeds, dogmas and practices.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our culture is crowded with spiritual snake oil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is &lt;strong>of paramount importance that our spirituality be validated or confirmed by fidelity to our personal experience.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only what is experientially true is worthy of mature spirituality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A mature spirituality will seldom provide us with answers, and necessarily so, but will instead ask ever-larger questions of us, Larger questions will lead to a larger life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>religion is for those afraid to go to Hell, and spirituality is for those who have been there.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Growing up spiritually means that we are asked to &lt;strong>sort through the possibilities&lt;/strong> for ourselves, find &lt;strong>what resonate with us, what is confirmed by our experience&lt;/strong> and not the consensus of others, and be willing to stand for what has proven true for us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Symbols help bridge us to the mysteries of the cosmos, to natural events, to each other, and to our own mysterious selves. Mysteries are not knowable directly. If they were knowable, they would not be mysteries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Symbol and metaphor are our greatest gift, for they make culture and spirituality possible.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Limited as we are, we are nonetheless able to &lt;strong>approach the largeness of mystery&lt;/strong> through the tools of metaphor and symbol.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He (Kant) was not saying that external reality does not exist; rather, that we can only know it subjectively. Our psyche takes the raw chaos of stimuli and organizes it into coherence according to categories of time, number, spatiality, and other elements of our minds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teilhard de Chardin came closest to bridging these worlds when he said that &lt;strong>matter is spirit moving slowly enough to be seen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Over time, the ego tends to privilege its own constructs and confuse them with external reality, or confuse them with the mystery. &lt;strong>Our finite sensibility cannot ultimately know that infinite mystery that has been called God&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The immature person, or culture, proclaims &amp;ldquo;our God is superior to your God,&amp;rdquo; the way children do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I insist that my taste is right and yours is wrong, then I have offended your humanity by denying the reality of your experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember that the word &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;soul&amp;rdquo; is designation of the autonomous energy that courses through the material guises of the world&lt;/strong> - in you, in me, in nature, in dream images and so on (Ishavara).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tragic devaluation of the spirit has led many to reject the possibility of transcendent and to throw themselves into the addictions and diversions of popular culture as antidotes for the pain of this great loss. It has led others to cynicism and depression.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Early cultures experiences the &lt;strong>world as &amp;ldquo;en-souled,&amp;rdquo; that is, all things being the embodiment or carriers of soul energy.&lt;/strong> The tree had soul (from which we still derive the expression &amp;ldquo;knock on wood&amp;rdquo;, as a summoning of the anima within the tree to stand by us for good fortune).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Comte noted that the sage of animism was replaced by the theological sage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We see the &lt;strong>transition from the animistic to the theological occurring when, for example, the immense power of the sea is embodied in a specific deity, Poseidon, whose name appropriately means &amp;ldquo;earth-shaker.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By the mid-nineteenth century many noted thinkers, from Kierkegaard to Nietzsche to Dostoevski, had concluded that &amp;ldquo;the gods had died.&amp;rdquo;. They were making psychological statements even before psychology as we know it, not metaphysical statements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>cultural forms of the gods, and their attendant value systems, no longer evoked the immediacy of personal experience.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rise of secular surrogates such as scientism and materialism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>animist understood that survival, and meaning, depend on the capacity to read the signature of the invisible at work in the visible world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One may see in popular theologies the same heresy as in psychology, namely the &lt;strong>confusion of the image with the energy that animates it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>world is de-souled, when what it needs is reanimation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>religious experience. Most people intuit this threat, this likely summons to largeness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dogma serves as a reassuring program of answers to questions that arise&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The dogma itself does not carry the mystery, though it may sincerely seek to sustain the impact. Rituals have the intent to re-crate the encounter with the mystery, to summon up the spirits, and hopefully reanimate the original encounter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In time they tend to become rigid, inflexible entrapments of soul rather than summers to largeness. Similarly, the cultural forms of dress, behaviour, ethics that distinguish one group from another can grow arbitrary, disconnected, and cultlike and become the source of alienation from other groups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>institutions - encapsulated entities that are most invested in preserving themselves.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sterile kingdoms of atheism and materialism, in which no transcendent expression will be found.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any project to revivify by going back is doomed to failure. New wine does not come from old wine bottles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These questions never go away, they go underground, into the unconscious.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>move us, that is set off a resonance within us&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we know that that image has some meaning for us. We feel it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>when the spirit is present, we&amp;rsquo;ll be moved.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>eternal questions will arise in quite different guises in all times, and persist in determining the value of our lives whether we are conscious of them or not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>inquire seriously&lt;/li>
&lt;li>only when it begins to hurt too much to deny any longer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>reclaim our lives from our history&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>resonance, that is, inner confirmation as opposed to external authority&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>often the conscious values we adopt, and cherish, are apotropaic defense against evil, rationalizations of our wounds, flights from the terror of being alone, or unwitting confessions of intimidation at the prospect of conducting our lives on our own authority&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>each of us has to make that discovery on our own&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>not psychologizing, that is reducing everything to subjective experience alone, but acknowledging that without that subjective confirmation, nothing finally will have a reality for us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung is suggesting that the &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; within the image can be only true for us if it becomes a psychological fact, that is inwardly apprehended and experienced by us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Serving a past image unconsciously may very well prove to be that oldest of religious heresies - idolatry! Idolatry is often a comforting artifact of the ego, but it does an impediment of the renewing agenda of the soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>dreaming - an average of six times per night,&lt;/strong> we are visited by this other world, which is nonetheless our world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The new myth will not come from above. Only totalitarian ideologies, or ego-crafted appeals to our complexes, will appear in such fashion. The &lt;strong>new myth will come as it always has, rising from the depths, greeting the tribe, summoning the individual to serve that which enlarges rather than diminishes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-ten-swampland-visitations">Chapter Ten: Swampland Visitations&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;In the midst of my day I shall go to the gates of Hell.&amp;rdquo; Isaiah 38:10&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>powerful fantasy of progress that lurks beneath the surface of contemporary culture&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowhere is this fantasy more identifiable than in our preoccupation with health, with youthful image, and with resistance to aging and mortality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The avoidance of our mortal transient condition is pathological.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>those who handle aging and mortality least well are those who fear that they have not been in this life, that they have not been here, that they have not lives the life they were called to live. Those most preoccupied wit appearance are typically those most resistant to the task of inner authority, for they continue to seek validation from the world out there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>suffering that forges larger and larger consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>magic versus the daily work of constructing our lives, and reward us with only superficial engagements with the wonder of terror of being here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pain is physiological and should be always alleviated when possible, for pain can erode the spirit&amp;rsquo;s vitality. Suffering is spiritual,&lt;/strong> for it inevitably raises question of meaning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>medieval adage: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;suffering is the fastest horse to completion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Koran asks, do we expect that the pathway to the Garden of Bliss will be less troubled for us than for those who have preceded us?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a West African metaphor that someone&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;feet are in agreement.&amp;rdquo; That is a metaphoric euphemism for death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are implicitly asked: &amp;ldquo;How am I to enlarge consciousness in this place; how embrace life here amid peril; hot find the meaning for me in this suffering?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ego&amp;rsquo;s central project is maintaining itself and privileging its own narrow position, we can see that without some challenge to that agenda, we would never grow larger than the messages of childhood and the limits of familial and cultural environment into which fate places us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ego&amp;rsquo;s agenda of reinforcement, comfort, order, control, security.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>fantasies of untroubled lives&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung has made clear, fidelity to &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;The Self is manifest in the opposites and in the conflict between them&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="guilt">Guilt&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>guilt is a necessary companion to a life of value, a life in which responsibility is assumed&lt;/strong>, in which moral vision matters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>acknowledge the wrongs they have committed to redress them wherever possible, or to at least make the attempt to symbolic compensation and restoration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>unacknowledged guilt is an unconscious anchor that weights upon the soul and siphons off its energy&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>existential guilt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deeply programmed into us by adulthood is the fear of loss of the love, approval, and cooperation of the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; in our lives, be it parent, partner, or institution&lt;/li>
&lt;li>archaic warning system. Guilt then acts as an internal governor, shutting down our natural selves and recalling the agenda of adaptation rather than authenticity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="grief-and-loss">Grief and Loss&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Loss seems to be the price of abundance, the counterpoise to the richness of life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Grief, which etymologically is related to the word gravity, from the Latin &amp;ldquo;gravis&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;to bear or carry&amp;rdquo;) is in due proportion to our commitment to life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Greek myth of &lt;strong>immortal Tithonus relates how he found his life meaningless because every choice this hour could be reversed in another. So he petitioned the gods to grant him mortality, so that his life, through his now risky choices, could be experienced as meaningful.&lt;/strong> They so blessed Tithonus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grief is honest acknowledgement of loss, which is based on honest acknowledging of value.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We cannot have the richness without the possibility of loss, and without loss we cannot fully treasure the gifts we have been given.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;serenity&amp;rdquo; is Gelassenheit.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>market-fueled fantasies of acquisition, control and ownership&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="betrayal">Betrayal&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>betrayal&amp;rdquo; is the betrayal of our expectations for such contracts.&lt;/strong> As Ecclesiastes recognized millennia ago, the rain falleth on the just and the unjust alike. So much for &amp;ldquo;deals&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who are incapable of trust live in a conspirational, fear-flushed world and suffer the overgeneralizing, paranoid fantasy of betrayal. Often this sensibility is derived from actual slights, injustices, and abuses in the past.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Such a person, so defended against betrayal, will never experience the richness and depth of relationship. In protecting our vulnerability we blunt all our possibilities.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most relationships, especially those most intimate, have an aura of disappointment about them, for we silently feel the other has betrayed us by not meeting our agenda for that relationship.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Betrayal may unmask our hidden dependencies.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The subtext of most relationship is dependency, rather than mutual support of the independence of each party.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="doubt-and-loneliness">Doubt and Loneliness&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In seeking certainly they are courting the death of the soul, whose nature is forever churning possibility&lt;/strong>, forever seeking the larger, forever riding the melting edge of certainty&amp;rsquo;s glacier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: &amp;ldquo;People who merely believe and don&amp;rsquo;t think, forget that they continually expose themselves to their own worst enemy: doubt. &lt;strong>Wherever belief reigns, doubt lurks in the background.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hysterical certainties propagated by political and religious institutions are in fact unconscious confessions of their own insecurity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our anxieties lead us to grasp at certainties. &lt;strong>Certainties lead to dogma; dogma leads to rigidity; rigidity leads to idolatry; idolatry always banishes the mystery and thus leads to spiritual narrowing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the more we seem to know, the larger the mystery grows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can we not doubt everything when the world is so rich, and our conscious capacities so limited? Our &lt;strong>doubt, then is a form of radical trust, a trust that the world is richer than we know.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>loneliness, the place without external validation&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loneliness is not one of the greatest disorders of the soul, but the fear of loneliness is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who manage to find respect for themselves, who learn to dialogue with themselves, who find that their dreams and other such phenomena are communicating with them from some deeper place within them are not really alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The failure to accept ourselves makes it very difficult if not impossible, to accept others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Loneliness is not inimical to companionship &amp;hellip; for &lt;strong>companionship thrives only when each individual remembers his individuality.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="depression">Depression&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>work our way through the depression to its meaning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for who among us has managed to live a life wholly in accord with the soul when we&amp;rsquo;re all trying to serve the cultural agenda at the same time?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;A neurosis is an offended god.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The therapeutic secret of a depression is not found by suppressing it with biochemical agents, but by asking its meaning.&lt;/strong> This investigative approach is enlarging, and the soul will not fail to offer direction if we are willing to be open.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="addictions">Addictions&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No one is free of addictions, for &lt;strong>addictions are anxiety-management techniques the purpose of which is to lower the level of psychic distress we feel at any given moment, whether we are conscious of the distress or not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>compulsive character, which means that they have a life outside our conscious control of awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the subtlest, and most pervasive, of addictive management techniques is habit itself, for habit is one of the means by which we hold off ambiguity and anxiety.&lt;/strong> Simple reflect on how irritated, that is how anxious, you feel when your habits, your daily routines, your conventional expectations are interrupted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>caught in a circular response to life that can only replicate itself, and the pain that lies at its core&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To ever break the stranglehold of addictions, one is going to have to &lt;strong>face what the compulsive behaviour is a defense against&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is to break the tyranny of anxiety without ceasing to feel anxious&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>as Heidegger observed once, &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;the terrible&amp;rdquo; has already happened.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="anxieties">Anxieties&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At bottom, all of our problems can be traced back to the omnipresence of anxiety.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Angst is the German word for therapeutical anxiety.&lt;/strong> threat of annihilation is palpable and present from our first to our last breath.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An acceptance of this angst as normal is healthy; its denial pathological.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Anxiety is free-floating, unattached, not unlike the fog that obscures the road we drive. Fear, however is specific.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our fears are typically derived from our powerless past.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>when one learns that beneath the current anxiety there is a buried filament that reaches back to the childhood fear, then one learns the secret of the disabling power of the anxious present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Philo of Alexandria: &amp;ldquo;Be kind. Everyone you meet is carrying a big problem&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accept the normality of anxiety, seek the roots of identifiable fears in that anxiety, then simply do the best we can and forgive the rest.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-we-avoid-swamplands">How Do We Avoid Swamplands&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>swamplands are &lt;strong>inevitable and necessary counterpart to our conscious fantasies of power.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more we have conquered in the outer world, the more the disquiet of our inner world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>task of life asks that we embrace this agenda of apparent loss as much as the agenda of acquisition that the first half of life served.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The flight from the swamplands of the soul, however unpleasant they may be to consciousness, is the flight from the wholeness of life, a wholeness that may only be expressed in paradox, and any psychology or worldview that excludes paradox is excluding half of life itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wholeness is not about comfort, or goodness or consensus - it means drinking this brief, unique, deeply rooted vintage to its dregs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The task of ego consciousness in the second half of life is to step out the way and embrace a larger spiritual agenda.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jung: &amp;ldquo;A life without inner contradiction is only half a life, or else a life in the Beyond which is destined only for angels. But God loves human beings more than the angels.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nikos Kazantzakis: &amp;ldquo;the report to a general: This is what I did today, this is how I fought to save the entire battle in my own sector, these are the obstacles found, this is how I plan to fight tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-eleven-the-healing-of-the-soul">Chapter Eleven: The Healing of the Soul&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>devotion to change&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>psychology has banished psyche, or soul, from its serious consideration, in favor of the lesser forms of behaviour and cognition and biochemistry.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For all the changes that have occurred over the last four centuries, perhaps our greatest loss is the diminution of dialogue about that mystery toward which the word soul is meant to point.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the world once summoned the priest in his black gown and then, when he could not save, transferred their demands to the physician in his white gown.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Living the questions that serve the ego, or culture&amp;rsquo;s insecurity, will only infantilize. We need questions that ask that we grow up.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-has-brought-you-to-this-place-in-your-journey-this-moment-in-your-life">What has brought you to this place in your journey, this moment in your life?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Destiny is a word that originally meant following a course, as a river within its banks, subject to modification, risking draying, flooding at times, being replenished, but always coursing toward an outlet in the large, tenebrous see of the soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consciousness is a task that renews its challenge every morning&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-gods-what-forces-what-family-what-social-environment-have-framed-your-reality-perhaps-supported-perhaps-constricted-it">What gods, what forces, what family, what social environment have framed your reality, perhaps supported, perhaps constricted it?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We are not summoned to perfection; that is the realm of gods; we are rather called to mindfulness, to approach such fields of divine reverence with sensitivity, respect and humility.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>deep split evolves between fate and destiny, between the forces of determination and the possibilities inherent in all of us&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Whose life have I been living?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we are the only character who is present in each scene, so we must be held accountable in the end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>accountability. If you do not like your life, change it, bust stop blaming others, for even if they did hurt you, you are the one who has been making the choices of adulthood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are, in the end, mythological creatures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>relationship to the inner world (what Jung called the &lt;em>anima&lt;/em>, Latin for &amp;ldquo;soul&amp;rdquo; that which is compensatory to his outer masculine identity and role.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>siren calls?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why is that &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; in achieving these goals so often feels empty? Why, having followed the plan, served the marching order, does one not feel an inner assent, a lightness which confirms?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="why-does-so-much-seem-a-disappointment-a-betrayal-a-bankruptcy-of-expectations">Why does so much seem a disappointment, a betrayal, a bankruptcy of expectations?&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>Joseph Campbell: &lt;strong>we can spend decades climbing the ladder, only to realize too late that we have places it against the wrong wall.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No person, no role in life, however rewarding, can ever carry the complete aspirations of the soul - only our move toward wholeness can**. Wholeness is not found in perfection.**&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the youth needs projections to pull him or her into life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first half of life feeds on these projections. During the second half of life, these projections lose their powers in the face of abrasions of daily life, and one suffers &lt;strong>ennui, disappointment&lt;/strong>, or even a sense that the presumed contract has been betrayed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Could these so called symptoms prove precisely the &lt;strong>clue for which we seek? Are they not the rejected gods of the underworld, speaking in their symbolic ways?&lt;/strong> Is what week to be found not &amp;ldquo;out there,&amp;rdquo; but beneath our noses? If such projections are necessary for the first half of life, then their erosion, their bankruptcy may be necessary for the second half of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What, indeed, does it profit one to gain the world that the projects have offered, and to find the price is loss of relationship to one&amp;rsquo;s soul? It is in the swamplands of disappointment, then, tat the task of personal ownership of the soul may be reclaimed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as we continue to cruise along, buoyed by the success of projects, we will be seduced into unconscious identification with trivial values.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The bad news for ego&amp;rsquo;s fantasy of sovereignty is that we suffer; the good news for the soul is that we suffer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The projections, if examined carefully, diminish life through their narrow frame; growing up enlarges life, makes it more interesting, and we might even become thereby somewhat less of a problem to those around us.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>most important message of life comes from the primary relationship with mother, father and siblings, and then ever-widening circles, the culture as a whole.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The psyche is autonomous and will express another, deeper script than that we received from our fated family of origin, culture, and peculiar histories&lt;/li>
&lt;li>surrender to this will&lt;/li>

&lt;li>well all retain an intuitive tie to that great, immortal sea from whence we came.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have mastered the language of the outer world through physics and chemistry, but the principle of synchronicity acknowledges that there is an inner world of causality as well. When the moment is ripe for us to hear, then the word is spoken.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Jung: &amp;ldquo;It is not I who create myself, rather I happen to myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The soul is intuited in childhood, pushed aside by the adaptive choices of consciousness, and recovered in adulthood only when we are willing to open to it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So the idea of the soul, the felt presence of the soul, intimidates while it sustains, and the summons to the ego is to relinquish its fantasy of sovereignty and be held in that fell.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We live amid politicians and theologians who infantilize us by fear-mongering, and scientist and psychologist who trivialize life by addressing only what can be empirically verified. We are so much larger than that.&lt;/strong> Just as much theology has forgotten the psyche, so much psychology has retreated from the soul.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This spiritual homesickness gives us the journey; the journey gives us our life, once again.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Poet Paul Eluard: &lt;strong>there is another world and it is this one!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Everywhere we look we see intimations of the soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Here you are, in this mysterious now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Called to witness, and to serve, to serve something much larger.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Even when surrounded by many other, your journey is solitary, for the life you are to choose is your life, not someone&amp;rsquo;s else.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Finding what supports you from within&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Agenda of growth, purpose and meaning that we all are meant to carry into the world and to share with others.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="te-presento-a-mi-quetzalcóatl">Te presento a mi Quetzalcóatl&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Una grandeza que se deriva de nuestras dos grandes raíces: Mesoamérica y España.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nuestras raíces no tienen por que pelear quinientos anos después de su violento encuentro.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El trauma de la conquista no se deriva de que recordemos un evento que, evidentemente, nadie en el mundo de hoy vivió&amp;hellip; deliberadamente nos inyectamos odio en el corazón.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El 13 de agosto de 1521 decenas de pueblos sometidos se liberaron del mas terrible y sanguinario yugo opresor, y junto a sus aliados castellanos comenzaron a construir México, un país surgido de la unidad y del triunfo, pero a cuyo pueblo le han narrado una versión de los hechos muy equivocada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>México es heredero de Teotihuacán y de Roma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La única participación de los mexicas fue conquistar y someter a los pueblos herederos de la gran tradición tolteca y comenzar a destruirla.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El gran Cristo mesoamericano: Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="la-profecía-de-quetzalcóatl">La profecía de Quetzalcóatl&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Quetzalcóatl es la unión del espíritu y la materia, la compenetración de todas las dualidades, la consciencia que llena el espacio entre el cielo y la tierra. Es la serpiente del mundo enroscada en la base del árbol de la vida, y el águila en su copa lista para emprender el vuelo. El sol invicto y la tierra sagrada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Anáhuac&lt;/em>, cuyo significado literal es &amp;ldquo;cerca del agua&amp;rdquo;, era el nombre que daban los pueblos nahuas a toda la zona donde se desarrolló su cultura en el centro de Mesoamérica. La expresión &lt;em>Cem Anáhuac&lt;/em>, totalmente rodeado de agua, significaba simbólicamente el único mundo.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="el-sacrificio-de-los-hijos-de-quetzalcóatl">El Sacrificio de los hijos de Quetzalcóatl&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Los legítimos herederos de los toltecas llevaban cien años sojuzgados por los hijos de Huitzilopochtli.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Huitzilopochtli fue un dios exclusivo de los mexicas cuyo culto no existía en el valle de México antes del siglo XV. Era un dios de la guerra, pero ante todo un dios del sol, al igual que Quetzalcóatl; es decir, son distintas manifestaciones de Tonatiuh, el sol.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aztlán, lugar originario de los mexicas. Entonces eran conocidos como aztecas o aztlantecas. Ya instalados en el valle de México, se hicieron llamar mexicas en honor a su dios guía, a su dios de la tribu, al que nombraban Mexi. &lt;em>Azteca&lt;/em> es una identidad basada en un supuesto lugar de origen, mientras &lt;em>mexica&lt;/em> es una identidad tribal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Todo renacimiento implica un sacrificio, y Quetzalcóatl, como en su mito, se sacrificó para que algo nuevo viera la luz.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="cayó-la-noche-sobre-el-pueblo-del-sol">Cayó la noche sobre el Pueblo del Sol&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ometéotl - la divinidad suprema del panteón mexica, fuente de todos los demás dioses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mictlán - inframundo en la mitología nahua.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coyolxauhqui es hermana de Huitzilopochtli, hija de Coatlicue. Se le identifica en general como diosa lunar; aunque la ausencia de signos lunares en su imagen nos dice que quizás es diosa de la noche.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El planeta Venus, asociado con Quetzalcóatl. Es el dios del amanecer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los mexicas subvirtieron todo el orden cósmico al sustituir a Quetzalcóatl por Huitzilopochtli, y eso los llevó a su efímera gloria, pero también a su caída.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>guerreros jaguar y águila de la noche y el día&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tlacéalel fue hermano de Moctezuma I Ilhuicamina, vivió en fechas no precias entre 1400 y 1475, y fue el reformador que construyó la visión divina que los mexicas tenían de sí mismos, y en la que el culto a Quetzalcóatl quedó subordinado al de Huitzilopochtli.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>el &lt;em>hubiera&lt;/em> es la fuente del odio contra nosotros mismos. Lo que ocurrió es lo único que existe, y era además la única posibilidad.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="los-dioses-despiertan-lentamente-de-su-letargo">Los dioses despiertan lentamente de su letargo&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tonatiuh es el nombre genérico del Sol, como deidad, en la cosmología náhuatl; sea que se manifieste como Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcóatl, Tláloc o Huitzilopochtli. No son diferentes dioses del Sol, son distintas advocaciones de la única divinidad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coatepec - cóatl + tépetl, cerro de la serpiente.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Como sol, Huitilopochtli está destinado a nacer. Coyolxauhqui y los Centzon Huitznáhauc están prestos a matar su madre, pero el hijo le habla desde el vientre para decirle que no tenga miedo pues él la defenderá. El sol salvará a la tierra, el hijo de Dios salvará al mundo, también como en todas las mitologías. Entonces el sol guerrero nació completamente armado, derrotó a cada uno de los cuatrocientos surianos (guerreros estelares del sur) y finalmente se enfrentó en cruenta batalla con su hermana Coyolxauhqui, porque la oscuridad es siempre hermana de la luz; le cortó la cabeza y arrojó su cuerpo degollado para que yaciera en las faldas de Coatepec, el cerro de la serpiente; es decir, el mundo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tláloc - dios de lluvia entre los mexicas. Su nombre completo en náhuatl era Tlalocentuhli y era considerado una manifestación de la totalidad de Dios, a travel del sol, la lluvia, las tempestades y los rayos, pero bajo la mitología mexica es que quedó limitado al concepto de lluvia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tláloc y Quetzalcóatl eran los dioses más venerados en todas las ciudades de la cuenca de Texcoco en los tiempos que llegaron los mexicas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tollan - &amp;ldquo;Gran Cuidad&amp;rdquo;, de manera incluso un poco mítica. Así pues, Teotihuacán fue Tollan, como luego lo fue Tula y Cholulua, y al final Tollan Tenochtitlán.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El 13 de agosto de 1521 los ídolos de piedra cayeron del Templo Mayor; no fueron derribados por la cerrazón religiosa de los castellanos sino por el rencor centenario de los taxcaltecas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alonso de Ávila, uno de los hombres de Cortés, construyó su casa, sobre la diosa de la noche descuartizada y decapitada; ahí, en 1566, su hijo murió decapitado por órdenes de los propios españoles tras participar en una rebelión de independencia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hasta que un día de 1790 los dioses antiguos comenzaron un lento despertar; poco a poco empezaron a salir. En aquel año, la diosa Coatlicue hizo su aterradora aparición.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>las viejas divinidades mexicas renacieron cuando los franceses estaban revolucionando el mundo, se encumbrara en Europa la era conocida como Ilustración, los viejos regímenes monárquicos comenzaban a caer ante nuevas ideas republicanas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teotihuacán había sido abandonada en torno al año 650&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La mujer adornada con cascabeles, Coyolxauhqui, la oscuridad de la noche, hija de Coatlicue, hermana y eterna combatiente de Huitzilopochtli.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>macehualtin - plebeyos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pipitlin - nobles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="los-dioses-en-la-mente-de-la-humanidad">Los dioses en la mente de la humanidad&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Los dioses son arquetipos psicológicos y las mitologías que nos hablan de ellos son modelos para comprender la mente y poder transformarla.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sol invicto y tierra sagrada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la eternidad antes del tiempo y la infinitud antes del espacio. El origen es la unicidad, justo lo que representa Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Las mitologías son herramientas simbólicas para tratar de comprender lo incomprensible, para descifrar nuestra mente y encontrar su pureza original detrás del conflicto.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="la-civilización-que-construyó-a-quetzalcóatl">La civilización que construyó a Quetzalcóatl&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>todos los grupos humanos crean cultura, pero no todos construyen civilización. La cultura del nómada es efímera.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La cultura del sedentario arraiga en las ciudades y sobrevive y se transmite dentro de los rituales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El fenómeno civilizatorio está relacionado directamente con la revolución agrícola.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guerrero y pastor nómada no establecen por lo tanto un esquema patriarcal de familia, sino clanes basados en el matrilinaje. No tienen relatos politeístas complejos sino simples, como su propia sociedad, y más que un panteón divino basado en el orden que derrota al caos y dioses del ciclo agrícola, tienen dioses guerreros que van con ellos a todos lados. Sus dioses también son nómadas. Los imperios siempre han dependido de los nómadas para el intercambio comercial, e incluso para vigilar las propias fronteras imperiales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En Eurasia, los movimientos de los grupos nómadas se daban en un eje del este a oeste, justo como es el continente y sus cadenas montañosas. En América el movimiento fue del norte a sur, como sus montañas, con lo que cambia la flora y fauna, los cultivos, el clima &amp;hellip;, todo dificulta la migración.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En Eurasia, las grandes planicies y la existencia de animales de tiro generaron ideas como la rueda. Estos tres elementos juntos desarrollaron la agricultura de manera mucho mas vertiginosa que en Mesoamérica.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cien años duró la gloria del Pueblo del Sol&amp;hellip; La historia del la civilización mesoamericana es de unos tres mil años.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="las-lenguas-en-las-que-fue-comprendido-quetzalcóatl">Las lenguas en las que fue comprendido Quetzalcóatl&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Entendemos el mundo en la lengua que hablamos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En Mesoamérica podemos hablar de tres grandes familias lingüísticas: la mayense, la otomangue y la nahua.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Muchas ciudades que hoy conocemos como nahuas probablemente hayan sido habitadas primero por grupos otomangues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nadie sabe quién construyó Teotihuacán, probablemente los otomíes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hoy se dice que las actuales ruinas de Teotihuacán que están excavadas y exploradas representan 10 por ciento del total de la ciudad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teotihuacán fue la última gran ciudad de una etapa mesoamericana caracterizada por los Estados teocráticos y los centros ceremoniales; tras su caída Mesoamérica verá el florecimiento de una era de Estados, que son abiertamente militarizados y expansionistas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Para el año 650, la ciudad que llegó a tener doscientos mil habitantes en sus días de gloria, no contaba con más de setenta mil, lo cual nos hable de éxodos masivos que serán el origen de nuevas ciudades en torno a la cuenca de Texcoco.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La gran familia lingüística nahua es originaria de Norteamérica, y desde ahí comenzaron a migrar hacia Mesoamérica en torno al año 500. Los mexicas fueron el último grupo de nómadas nahuas que se establecieron en el lago de Texcoco, alrededor del año 1200.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tula comenzó a ser importante en torno al 850, llegó a su gloria para el 950 y cayó cien años despues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tula es la ciudad donde la cosmovisión teotihuacana comienza a expresarse en náhuatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quetzalcóatl es un mito que se construyó a lo largo de unos dos mil años y en los diversos pueblos aportaron su visión, incluidos los castellanos, ya que fueron los primeros franciscanos quienes desarrollaron el mito de Hernán Cortés como el regreso de la Serpiente Emplumada. Nació entre los olmecas como dios de fertilidad, fue entre teotihuacanos cuando se entendió como un dios solar relacionado con el viento y representado en forma de serpiente; es en algún espacio entre Teotihuacán y Tula cuando pasa a ser el dios creador de la humanidad que desciende al inframundo y resucita, y es en su humanización tolteca cuando se marcha con la promesa de volver. Ése sería el regreso que esperaba Moctezuma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La guerra civil y la decadencia de Tula generaron al parecer una serie de migraciones de población tolteca hacia el este, a la zona maya. Habría sido en las costas mayas donde Quetzalcóatl se inmola en su balsa de serpientes para convertirse en el planeta Venus y ascender al cielo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Este mundo es un espejo, por eso está creado y regido por los Tezcatlipocas, o espejos de humo, hijos de la pareja divina primordial. Un espejo de humo porque todo en el mundo terminará por evaporarse en la nada de la que ha sido surgido. Los nahuas, como los hindúes, persas y egipcios, sabían que el mundo es una ilusión. En realidad, la civilización occidental es la única que no lo sabe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quetzalcóatl es espejo hermoso, pues la Serpiente Emplumada es el Tezcatlipoca blanco; el espejo luminoso. Quetzal significa &amp;ldquo;precioso&amp;rdquo; y coatl, además de &amp;ldquo;serpiente&amp;rdquo;, también quiere decir &amp;ldquo;gemelo&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="el-matrimonio-divino-entre-el-cielo-y-la-tierra">El matrimonio divino entre el cielo y la tierra&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>en la mente o en el universo, que es lo mismo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>si descifras a Quetzalcóatl podrás volver a la unicidad original de tu mente, el paraíso original del que hablan todos los relatos religiosos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En tu mente hay solo dos voces. La voz que te impulsa hacia arriba - Quetzalcóatl. La otra (hacia abajo) te ofrece los placeres de mundo, te habla de guerra y conflicto, de imponer voluntad sobre otras, de competir y triunfar, de someter y conquistar a otros pero nunca a ti mismo. Es la voz de inercia, un espejo que te muestra un mundo como de humo, que se desvanece en el tiempo porque no es real. Vamos a llamarle Tezcatlipoca, tu reflejo oscuro.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En el caso mesoamericano nunca son el bien y el mal, es muy importante cuidarse de esa interpretación judeocristiana. Es una fuerza que desciende y una fuerza que asciende.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El mundo, aunque sea un sueño, es el sueño de Dios; aunque sea una ilusión, es la ilusión que le permite a la consciencia reconocerse a sí misma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Para los nahuas, volver a Aztlán, a esa tierra prometida, a es la unicidad de la mente, es la segunda llegada de Cristo; en tradición náhuatl: el regreso de Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El camino de regreso al paraíso, el viaje del héroe, comienza en todas las mitologías por un descenso al inframundo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(13) En el cielo número trece reside la pareja primigenia, Ometecuhtli y Omecíhuatl, el dios y diosa de la sustancia primordial del mundo, que no es otra cosa que la dualidad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El cielo número trece sería el nivel más elevado de conscienca dentro del mundo, pero al ser morada de la dualidad, deja claro que haya algo más &amp;ldquo;arriba&amp;rdquo;. Mas alá del mundo todo es simplemente Ometéotl, el Ser.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Otros cielos:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>(12) donde residen los cuatro rectores de los puntos cardinales que la tradición náhuatl conocerá como los cuatro Tezcatlipocas;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(11) la fuente de calor y la vida;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(10) la casa del sol;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(9) el espacio donde se mueve la luz;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(8) la casa de las tempestades;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(7) corresponde a la fuerza guerrera de la voluntad, que es donde los mexicas colocarán posteriormente a Huitzilopochtli&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(6) la morada de la oscuridad&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(5) la esfera de cometas y estrellas errantes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(4) donde se muevan el sol del alba y del ocaso&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(3) la casa occidental del sol&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(2) órbita de las estrellas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(1) el más cercano a la tierra, es la órbita lunar.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bajo los trece cielos está el mundo de los humanos, que se pueden mover en las cuatro direcciones del espacio, cada una regida por un Tezcatlipoca.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desde nuestro nivel comienza el descenso por los nueve círculos del inframundo:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Aquí te espera Xólotl, es dios de la entrada al inframundo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Montañas que chocan entre sí&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sendero de piedras de obsidiana que rasgan a los muertos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mundo congelado y sin vida&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los vendavales te llevan sin remedio de un lugar a otro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>los muertos son atacados por flechas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fieras salvajes que muerden el corazón&lt;/li>
&lt;li>serie de ríos donde se va apagando el fuego de la consciencia&lt;/li>
&lt;li>espacio sin luz donde el difunto se disuelve en el olvido hasta entrar finalmente en el Mictlán, el lugar sin puerteas ni ventanas, la caverna sin retorno.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La pirámide que los mexicas llamaron del Sol parece haber sido dedicada al dios de las tormentas - Tlalocantecuhtli, o simplemente Tláloc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La llamada Pirámide de la Luna habría sido un templo a su contraparte feminina, Chalciuhtlicue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La lluvia es una manifestación de Tláloc. Este dios representa el movimiento de descenso divino, simboliza todas las bendiciones que bajan del cielo a la tierra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tláloc era el dios más importante de todos los pueblos mesoamericanos. No era un dios, Tláloc era Dios.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tláloc no es un dios completo. La otra mitad es precisamente Chalciuhtlicue - simboliza el ascenso sagrado.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La pirámide mayor de Teotihuacán no era del sol, pero sí del descenso divino; y dado que está orientada en un eje este-oeste, siguiendo el movimiento del sol.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La llamada Pirámide de la Luna, un una orientación norte-sur, es claramente una advocación femenina.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El norte representa los dioses de Tezcatlipoca, la oscuridad y la muerte, dios de la noche y la tentación. El camino femenino simboliza nuestra capacidad de morir y renacer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quetzalcóatl; una serpiente que emerge de la tierra con un claro movimiento ascedente, con la cabeza coronada con mazorcas o magueyes; con lo que estaríamos viendo a una divinidad de la agricultura y la fertilidad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la muerte personificada en Mictlantecuhtli.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Los bárbaros del norte siempre están al acecho, ye fue así en ambos lados del océano.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Al rededor del año 500, diversos grupos de migrantes nahuas comenzaron a habitar el norte de Teotihuacán, donde fueron conocidos como chichimecas, y así eran conocidos por ser saqueadores que vivían del trabajo de los pueblos civilizados y agrícolas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sin importar quiénes hayan tomado Teotihuacán, su intención no era apoderarse de la ciudad, sino acabar con ella.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los invasores y los invadidos se fusionaron y crearon algo nuevo.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="quetzalcóatl-voló-por-el-cielo-mesoamericano">Quetzalcóatl voló por el cielo mesoamericano&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>La ciudad es una agrupación natural, el reino y el imperio son producto de la guerra y la conquista entre las ciudades; pero los pueblos del valle de Anáhuac estaban lejos de formar una unidad política.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Las ciudades luchaban y se hacían la guerra unas a otras, siempre para robar, porque para eso son las guerras&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teotihuacán fue la ciudad mas importante de todas, pero nunca la capital de un Estado consolidado.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Las rutas y centros de comercio han sido los grandes difusores de cultura en la historia de humanidad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los nahuas dispersaron la toltequidad por todo su mundo y Quetzalcóatl voló por todo el cielo mesoamericano.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amón era el dios supremo y estaba representado precisamente por el sol; al amanecer se llamaba Khepri, y estaba representado como el escarabajo que, tras pasar la noche bajo tierra, escarba al alba para nacer nuevamente; es el sol que nace para ascender, el nuevo comienzo. Ya en el cenit en toda su gloria y mostrando toda su fuerza era Ra, el supremo; al atardecer, cuando descendía en el ocaso para combatir a las tinieblas, se llamaba Atum, el cordero que se sacrifica por el hombre.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la Serpiente Emplumada representaba todo el viaje de la luz por la bóveda celeste. Al amanecer era conocido como Tlahuizcalpantecuchtli, el lucero del alba, al medio día era Tonatiah en toda su gloria, y en el crepúsculo era Xólotl, el xoloitzcuintle que desciende al inframundo, junto con Quetzalcóatl, para enfrentar la oscuridad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El príncipe Quetzalcóatl, representante de la vieja tradición, con un culto monoteísta que giraba en torno a un dios benévolo se habría enfrentado contra los seguidores del dios Tezcatlipoca, con un culto un tanto más oscuro que giraba alrededor del sacrificio humano. Es la confrontación entre el dios de los sedentarios, siempre más estables y clementes, contra los dioses guerreros de los nómadas, siempre más implacables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dios no tiene forma, pero los dioses son hechos a imagen y semejanza del hombre, y sus designios suelen ir de acuerdo con las necesidades politicas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El relato que se hace de Ce Ácatl Topiltzin contra los hechiceros de Tezcatlipoca difícilmente es verídico; pero nos habla de una guerra civil, que debilitó a la ciudad ya la hizo incapaz de contener las hordas chichimecas que comenzaron a llegar del norte alrededor del año 1000.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La Serpiente Emplumada nunca brota en medio del conflicto.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>In Xóchitl in cuícatl&lt;/em>, flores y cantos, expresión de los sabios y poetas nahuas, que se refiere a la poesía, filosofía, reflexiones de carácter místico y teológico, que pretenden ayudar a los hombres a comprender los inexplicables misterios divinos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No tanto un buen gobierno, sino una buena consciencia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los hombres contienen la esencia y sustancia divina, pero están condenados al olvido.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En las mitologías sagradas, el olvido de Dios es la causa de la tragedia humana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adán y Eva mancillan la santidad de su paraíso al transgredir el único límite inquebrantable, que era precisamente no querer conocer el mundo, no hacer el descenso y caer prisioneros de la ilusión de la materia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los placeres del mundo causaron la caída de Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tlillan Tlapallan, el paraíso primigenio donde Quetzalcóatl, el dios, había creado a la humanidad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subió al cielo en forma de Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, la estrella del alba, con la promesa de volver.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La Tierra Prometida nunca ha tenido una ubicación geográfica, siempre es un estado mental y un lugar en tu corazón.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los mitos no son historia, son algo mucho más profundo aún, que nada tiene que ver con los hechos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los pueblos antiguos siempre depositaron más interés en los mitos que en los hechos, y los poemas y cantares, las flores y cantos, siempre fueron más relevantes que las cronologías.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No estudiar el pasado con los calores y ideas aceptadas del presente.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entre los griegos, surgió el interés por los hechos, sin interpretaciones ni simbolismos; y esa actitud fue que tomaron los estudiosos de la historia a partir del siglo XVIII&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>tolteca&lt;/em> pasó a ser sinónimo de gran constructor, de artista sublime, de artesano perfecto. Lo que construía un tolteca, era a si mismo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mixcóatl (los nahuas), un guerrero nómada de las áridas tierras del norte, y Chimalma (los otomíes), una doncella de las fértiles tierras de sur.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mixcóatl significa &amp;ldquo;nube de serpientes&amp;rdquo; y es el nombre que los toltecas le daban a la Vía Láctea, la totalidad del universo según ellos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En Amatlán nació el príncipe que sería llamado como el año de su nacimiento, Ce Ácatl (Uno Caña); y después, al ser entronado en Tula, sería llamado Topiltzin (Nuestro Señor), y por su calidad de sumo sacerdote sería conocido como Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no hay pecado, porque no hay malicia; lo que hay es engaño. El ego siempre engaña, y su principal mentira es la culpa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Las emociones negativas te hacen perder el paraíso original.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ce Ácatl Topiltzin se dirige hacia el oriente, por donde sale el sol, hacia el camino de la luz.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>el final del camino espiritual siempre es soltando lastre, y al final es siempre un solitario.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No importa si te vence el mundo, Dios siempre volverá por ti. Es la historia de Ce Ácatl Topiltzin y la promesa redentora de Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>el mundo mesoamericano, tal como el egipcio o el hindú, no pretende estar sustentado en certezas. La incertidumbre es su única certeza.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Un mejor futuro, como se pudiera haber entendido, tenía más que ver con rituales de corte místico, religioso y mitológico que con planeaciones basadas en certezas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>una civilización sedentaria que busca explicaciones en el pasado.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mente nahua, de mundo ilusorio y tiempo cíclico, y los frailes entendieron con su mente latina de mundo real y tiempo lineal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aztlán, o lugar edénico de la blancura&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chicomóztoc o lugar de las siete cuevas, otro lugar mítico&lt;/li>
&lt;li>chichimeca, que significa &amp;ldquo;linaje de perros&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La mente de estos brujos y chamanes es absolutamente mágica y ellos consideran que la vida humana gira en torno al ritual&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La sangre es la sustancia primordial de todo ritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Su pensamiento no es racional, son la antítesis de la civilizacíon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Huitziltzin - &amp;ldquo;señor del sur&amp;rdquo;, el chamán hechicero que guiará al grupo más adelante. En honor a este líder los mexicas rebauticen a su dios como Huitzilopochtli, el colibrí del sur, el que voló con ellos hasta el sur.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En torno a 1247 muere su hechicero supremo Huitziltzin, aquel que naciera con el anterior fuego nuevo, y el grupo llevó a cabo un ritual para convertir a su líder en un espíritu guía tras la muerte.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El ultimo líder en la peregrinación: Tenoch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chamanes y brujos, cuyos rituales siempre giraban en torno a la muerte&lt;/li>

&lt;li>la guerra florida se libra en tu interior y es ahí donde vences a Tezcatlipoca&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la guerra es contra las pasiones incontenibles y los pensamientos errantes, el campo de la batalla es el interior del individuo, el inframundo es el propio inconsciente y sus perturbaciones, y el premio es el florecimiento glorioso.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>los jefes guerreros von a Culhuacán a solicitar a Acamapichtli, hijo de un guerrero culhua con una mujer azteca, que sea su tlatoani (orador o &amp;ldquo;el que habla&amp;rdquo;. Era la voz de su pueblo con otros pueblos, y la voz de sus dioses con sus súbditos), y ser así parte del linaje que viene desde la Cuidad de los Dioses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tlacaélel es el creador de la cosmovisión mexica que los llevó a esa máxima gloria, pero fue también el causante de que ese poderío se esfumase de pronto, como el humo del espejo de Tezcatlipoca.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La Serpiente Emplumada de Teotihuacán representa, entre tantas cosas, la civilización, la manifestación de que el orden ha vencido al caos; el Tezcatlipoca de los guerreros nómadas es dios del caos.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="el-sacrificio-de-los-dioses-muestra-su-divinidad-a-los-hombres">El sacrificio de los dioses muestra su divinidad a los hombres&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>un águila sobre un nopal devorando una serpiente. El árbol de la vida mesoamericano, con la materia siendo devorada por el espíritu. Serpiente y plumas, los dos elementos constitutivos de Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los aztecas no llegan a construir una civilización, sino a alimentarse de la que ya está ahí.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El pacto es simple: poder a cambio de sangre.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A cambio de vida, Quetzalcóatl sólo pide vida. Parte esencial de su enseñanza es que el sacrificio es innecesario. Dios se sacrifica por el hombre porque un dios verdadero es fuente de vida.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El Dios es quien se sacrifica por el humano. No es poner fin al sacrificio humano o animal, sino la idea misma de la necesidad de inmolar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La existencia del mundo como lo conocemos parece implicar un sacrificio y la idea de dolor y sufrimiento. Pero el mundo implica una separación de la unicidad original&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Por más ilusoria que sea la separación, puesto que Dios es indivisible, no hay mayor sacrificio concebible que separarse de la fuente y padecer el mundo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El mundo es resultado de una muerte primigenia. Dejar la esfera sutil de lo divino para experimentar la dimensión burda del humano.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los hombres son producto del sacrificio divino; por eso son llamados macehuales, que significa &amp;ldquo;hombre merecido&amp;rdquo; o &amp;ldquo;hombre por merecimiento&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lo que buscaban toltecas - construirse a uno mismo, dotarse de un rostro verdadero y un corazón bueno.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La divinidad se sacrifica para que uno experimente el más elevado nivel de la dimensión humana, lo cual requiere una constante guerra florida, una guerra contra uno mismo para florecer en ella, un sacrificio constante para que valga la pena el holocausto divino.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La religión de la Serpiente Emplumada es sacrificarse para generar una vida virtuosa que agrade a los dioses.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>el pensamiento del presente está basado y causado en el del pasado.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intentamos dar nombre a lo que no lo tiene, para envolvernos a nosotros mismos en el engaño de que somos capaces de descifrar lo indescifrable y comprender lo ininteligible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fue apenas en el llamado Siglo de las Luces de la civilización occidental cuando comenzó la negación del misterio divino como eje de la vida&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tloque Nahuaque, el señor y dueño de todo lo cercano y de lo lejano, Ipalnemohuani, señor de la inmediata vecindad, de todo lo que nos rodea, Aquel por quien todos viven, Moyocozatzin, el inventor de Sí mismo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tlaltecuhtli, el monstruo del caos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>el mondo surge de nada. la otra opción es un mundo que existe desde siempre, otra imposibilidad lógica; donde todo es una cadena de transformaciones y el mundo siempre viene de un estado anterior. o nada ha existido nunca, o todo ha existido siempre.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El único objetivo sensato de la existencia humana es descubrir lo real y colocarlo por encima del sueño del mundo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sólo el ser humano vale la pena, porque es la expresión de esa consciencia eterna reconociéndose a Sí misma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>el hombre es el único camino al misterio divino&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>intuyeron que (detrás de los dioses) tendría que haber algo supremo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la idea de varios dioses deriva de la multiplicidad de fenómenos del mundo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la dualidad es fuente de conflicto entre opuestos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El Ser simplemente Es, sin conflicto, sin tiempo ni espacio, sin dualidad ni movimiento. Es Ser es quietud y es paz, no tiene que ver con el mundo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tonatiuh y Meztli, sol y luna; y a Tonacatecuhtli y Tonacacíhuatl, señor y señora del sustento, la manifestación masculina y femenina de la vida.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tonacatecuhtli y Tonacacíhuatl engendraron a los cuatro Tezcatlipocas, los espejos humeantes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El mundo, esta dimensión donde parece existir la materia, es un mero reflejo de lo divino, lo real, lo eterno; son humeantes porque así es el mundo, algo efímero que se desvanece en el aire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tezcatlipoca Negro, conocido simplemente como Tezcatlipoca, es el reflejo oscuro, rector del norte, el rincón de la muerte y punto de entrada al Mictlán.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tezcatlipoca blanco, o Quetzalcóatl, es el reflejo luminoso, el gemelo precioso, rector del este, el rincón por donde sale el sol&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tezcatlipoca rojo, Xipe Tótec, es el dios de la destrucción y renovación, rector del oeste, por donde muere el sol precisamente para renacer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tezcatlipoca Azul, fue a quien los mexicas convirtieron en su Huitzilopochtli, rector del sur y señor de la guerra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lo divino se manifesta entonces en dos dimensiones: la vertical y la horizontal. La vertical representa el descenso y ascenso, desde el treceno cielo hasta el noveno inframundo. En medio de eso, en la tierra, los seres humanos, con la capacidad de elegir el rumbo, a través de la voluntad, la única fuerza que te permite transcender el mundo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tezcatlipoca Negro es el origen de todo en el mundo y un reflejo escuro de la realidad divina. Todo aquí está al revés, que el mundo es precisamente lo que no es Dios. Es muerte y destrucción, batalla y conflicto. Contra la unicidad te ofrece fragmentación, frente al infinito y lo ilimitado te engaña con el espacio, y ante la realidad de la eternidad te ofrece la ilusión del tiempo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cuando Jesús rechaza tres veces a su propio Tezcatlipoca, a Satán, es porque éste le ofrece todos los reinos del mundo, y Jesús sabe que eso no es nada, es humo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mientas Mar ay Satán son demonios, Tezcatlipoca es un dios y se le venera. Se comprende que de alguna manera es parte del convite divino, parte de la estructura de la mente y, por lo tanto, tiene una función igualmente divina.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tóxcatl, dedicado a un Tezcatlipoca que era en realidad Huitzilopochtli&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tóxcatl es una fiesta perfecta para hablarte del ego y sus engaños si penetras en su significado. Se seleccionaba al joven más hermoso, y durante un año se le llenaba de placeres, fiestas, lujos, mujeres &amp;hellip; y luego era sacrificado.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la Serpiente Emplumada presenta la unión de las dualidades, un reflejo luminoso de la realidad divina. Quetzalcóatl es el dios de la vida.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Xipe Tótec es nuestro señor desollado, un dios sin piel, muerte y resurrección, y en su nivel más externo es dios de la agricultura y la renovación de la vegetación; es un dios de destrucción, dentro de un ciclo sin fin.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>impermanencia, condición esencial del mundo. Insustancialidad. Todo está siendo para dejar de ser. Nada Es.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Todo lo bueno pasará, todo lo malo también, y eso no está bajo nuestro control, por lo que es necesario ir más allá de esa tormenta que nos agita las emociones de un lado a otro, y aprender a contemplar lo eterno.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no tiene sentido que la existencia exista para no tener sentido. Xipe Tótec te lanza a la búsqueda de algo inmutable en medio de todo este torbellino de destrucción.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La destrucción es necesaria para que la vida sea eterna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tezcatlipoca Azul es la voluntad para ganar la batalla; por eso es un dios de guerra. Es necesaria una voluntad guerrera para luchar contra los instintos y las pasiones, contra los engaños y la inercia del mundo, contra el ego y la oscuridad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La existencia sí tiene sentido, pero descubrirlo implica un esfuerzo. Huitzilopochtli es ese esfuerzo, esa guerra florida.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Para elegir y tomar el camino de la luz estamos dotados de la voluntad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Todo comienza en Ometéotl y todo debe regresar a esa unicidad original.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El camino de Tezcatlipoca te aferra al mundo y te lleva por la vereda de los nueve niveles del inframundo hasta llegar al Mictlán y encontrarte con la muerte; el camino de Quetzalcóatl te libera de las ilusiones y te conduce por los trece cielos hasta volver al origen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>El norte ofrece el frío y la muerte de Tezcatlipoca que te muestra la entrada el Mictlán, lugar sin retorno. El sur te muestra la voluntad guerrera de Huitzilopochtli, necesaria para obtener la vida eterna. El oeste representa la impermanencia y constante destrucción de Xipe Tótec, pero por el este regresa siempre Quetzalcóatl para elevarse como sol triunfante y mostrarte la eternidad.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>el mexicano del siglo XXI sigue luchando del lado de la oscuridad de Tezcatlipoca, porque ése es en realidad Huitzilopochtli, y evita el nacimiento del nuevo sol, uno que será dominado por los hijos mestizos de los toltecas y los castellanos; así como los toltecas eran los hijos mestizos de los otomíes y los chichimecas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los mexicas no gobernaban, ni mucho menos administraban, el valle de Anáhuac. Ellos simplemente lo saqueaban.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Como todos los tlatoanis, su primer acto fue lanzar una terrible guerra contra las ciudades del valle de Tlaxcala y así obtener prisioneros parra el sacrificio.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los aztecas o mexicas son también parte de nuestro pasado, una muy pequeña, muy breve, y muy sanguinaria y destructiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nosotros, los mexicanos del siglo XXI, aún estamos sometidos por ellos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cualquier amor que se sienta por un México distinto, el del &lt;em>hubiera&lt;/em>, es falaz y ficticio.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sistema educativo diseñado para alienar la mente.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>pasar del caos al orden implica una lucha, un sacrificio divino.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En una primera oportunidad, el Espejo Humeante creó el sol con el elemento tierra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Luego fundó un nuevo sol con su elemento propio: el viento; creó hombres a los que ensenó la agricultura.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tercero y cuarto sol que fueron como medias eras&lt;/li>
&lt;li>llenó el mundo de agua para dar vida al cuarto sol&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tecuciztécatl - el dios del caracol. El caracol marino es uno de los símbolos de Quetzalcóatl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>En su propia versión del mito, los mexicas se plantean a sí mismos como el pueblo de origen humilde, los nómadas sin hogar despreciados por los civilizados.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>el Nuevo Testamento se deja clara la esencia del pacto con Dios: si hay fe, no hay sacrificio.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mientras Jesús se hace cerne y sangre de Dios para que la esencia divina sea consumida por el hombre, la comunión con Huitzilopochtli se logra consumiendo la carne y la sangre los hombres inmolados.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Por razones incomprensibles, dos siglos de historia azteca resultan ser más importantes que tres mil años de Mesoamérica.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No existía para esos pueblos la noción de Estado o país, ni mucho menos una identidad con base en dichos conceptos. Su estructura era la del clan, y su identidad estaba atada a esa red de familia; lazos de sangre que giran en trono a un ancestro legendario.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Es mucho más probable que el mexicano de hoy descienda de cualquier otro de los pueblos castellanos incluidos, que de los mexicas.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>[el fin del mundo:] Siempre se vuelva al caos, pero siempre renace algo nuevo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>los invasores adoptaron la cultura de los invadidos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dios siempre pone pruebas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rómulo y Remo, sobrevivirían amamantados por una loba, que no era sino el dios de los campos y la fertilidad, Fauno Luperco&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Está claro que Dios no elige pueblos, pero cada pueblo que se asume como elegido ha actuado en consecuencia y ha llegado a la grandeza. Los mitos moldean la mente de los individuos y los pueblos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los mexicanos somos los hijos de toda su grandeza [de toltecas y castellanos], y nos contamos una historia de caída y tragedia que lleva demasiado tiempo determinando nuestro destino.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Mayahuel, una representación de la madre tierra, será la diosa del pulque, y sus cuatrocientos hermanos conejos, los Centzon Totochtin, los dioses de la embriaguez.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quetzalcóatl, el rey, nació de la unión del cielo y la tierra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los hombres de maíz, la humanidad de Quetzalcóatl, es la verdadera civilización mesoamericana&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fue relativamente sencillo asimilar a Jesús con Quetzalcóatl; a Guadalupe, la versión mariana que llega con Cortés, con la madre divina Tonantzin; e incluso a Tezcatlipoca con Satán.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>engaño es la causa del mundo, que por eso es ilusorio.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="al-día-siguiente-de-la-conquista">Al día siguiente de la conquista&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>no fue el inicio de una resistencia indígena a una ocupación militar, eso no ocurrió nunca. Los diversos pueblos asumieron a Hernán Cortés como el nuevo líder del lago de Texcoco.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>la casa de Habsburgo comenzó a conquistar aquello que había creado Hernán Cortés con sus aliados indígenas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ninguno [pueblo] veía nada extraño en que se dieran órdenes desde el centro del lago de Texcoco, sin importar quién fuera el gran señor; ninguno vio como algo insólito o chocante que la religión de sus señores se inculcara sobre todos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No hubo un México preexistente que fuese invadido sino uno que comenzó a formarse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sólo dos emociones raíz mueven todo el psiquismo del ser humano: el amor y el odio, que en realidad se deriva del miedo. Amor y miedo. Sólo una construye.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nunca hay buenas intenciones detrás de un discurso de odio.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>purépechas del oeste, chichimecas del norte, oaxaqueños del sur y mayas al este seguían su vida. El líder de los hombres del mar había derrotado a los oscuros mexicas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tlaxcala comenzó a formar la Nueva España que se convertiría en México.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>viruela: la población originaria pasó de alrededor de dieciocho millones a sólo setecientos cincuenta mil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La religión se fue adaptando, no imponiendo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cuatro indígenas fueron quemados en la historia de Nueva España.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>La Inquisición en Nueva España llegó a vigilar la conducta de los propios castellanos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Con Juárez comenzó la verdadera debacle indígena. Para el siglo XXI es evidente: la clase política, nunca indígena y mucho menos conquistada, usa a los indígenas y la conquista como discurso siempre en su favor.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>la división fue nuevamente la cause de nuestra muerte.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Los toltecas esperaban a Quetzalcóatl y llegó Jesús. El mismo Christo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lo mejor de Europa depositó su semilla en lo mejor de América&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Somos un pueblo elegido. Nuestro único enemigo es quien convoque a nuestra división y conflicto.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Somos hijos de dioses en ambos lados del océano.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Liberalism is not about freedom, it is about license.

&lt;li>This was the &lt;strong>beauty and promise of the material, and the sacramental nature of worship: The corporeal spiritualized, and so more heartily embraced.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The recognition of one&amp;rsquo;s independent selfhood and completeness is critical, for only when we recognize the distinct nature of our own selfhood can we fully engage with other beings and ultimately engage with Being Himself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>Ten Command-ments&lt;/strong> clearly were, as were the other elements of Hebrew law. Yet man could not be saved by simple adherence to this law; it did not alone make him good, it only &lt;strong>left him in a state that might be saved.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In judicial system, mercy is replaced by statutory lenience, in the economic sphere, alms-giving is replaced by socialism, in the domestic sphere, chivalry is transformed into feminism.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The strength in turning the other cheek comes from submitting ourselves to the will of God, who is higher and stronger than any of our tormentors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a man could walk outside the natural hierarchy as long as he assured himself he was a child of grace.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every science imposes on the object of its study a particular epistemic closure, a self-imposed limitation on what matters it investigates.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No competent practitioner ever approaches an empirical problem without first establishing a theory.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>At the top of this hierarchy are the &lt;strong>fabulist&lt;/strong>, the man whose wills close the system of thought under one paradigm and thus set the new cosmos - men like Darwin, Einstein, Hawking. Beneath them are the &lt;strong>explicators&lt;/strong>, the disciples of clear minds who best understand the esoteric models their progenitors have provided them and most fully inhabit the new cosmos. They are men of aptitude but not genius, whose vision is whole but not new, who best proselytize the belief that science has something at all to offer man. And below them were the &lt;strong>aphid-counters&lt;/strong>, those actually engaged in the drudgery of empirical work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="bacon-and-utility">Bacon and Utility&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;to make men perfect was no part of Bacon&amp;rsquo;s plan. His humble aim was to make imperfect men comfortable. This aim of Baconian philosophy was to supply vulgar wants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bacon&amp;rsquo;s science presumes that its proper end is material, and that the heights of human knowledge it accommodates are to be employed towards creation of wealth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;We are not able to make cosmological models without some admixture of ideology&amp;rdquo;, admits Hawking himself.&lt;/strong> Indeed the hard scientist is more dependent on his social scientist counterparts than vice-versa.&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="defining-ideology">Defining Ideology&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>where there is no force but the material to guide man in his beliefs, the intellectual must always reduce to matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>An ideology differs from simple opinion in that it claims to posses either the key to history, or a solution to all the riddles of the universe, or the intimate knowledge of hidden universal laws which are supposed to rule nature and man.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ideology is application of Scientism to the social sphere.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="ideology-and-the-french-revolution">Ideology and the French Revolution&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The ancient philosophers looked at the man and asked how he should best be ruled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The mob takes to the street and cries for the material or political benefits all men desire, while the masses take to the streets to let others know they will be ruled, they will be swayed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the poor are always best protected when they are most closely united to the bonds that Nature&amp;rsquo;s God has fettered them with&lt;/strong>; it is to these they can best turn for guidance in their affairs, and to the Just Judge for recompensation. What feeble identities they own, whatever peasant, landowner, guildsman, or father confer accordant rights of status, and provide surest balustrade against the onslaught of money and might, which are never long without powers of suasion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Liberal conquers not by gaining material resources, land or the will of Providence, but by creating dependence: he creates the territory of Liberty, Equality and Justice, then afterwards he conquers, first standing suppliant to a common dream, then ensnaring those he has enticed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The underlying characteristic of the French Revolution is that the state would no longer meet men as they were: as peasants, nobles, Churchmen, Jews, but as universal citoyon.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Capitalism is the most effective means by which ideological change is given material form. It is in a sense conservative, as it appeals to man&amp;rsquo;s sensibility, which always strives for bodily contentment.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="capitalism-is-the-enemy-of-property">Capitalism is the Enemy of Property&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>A commodity is a good produced not for use, but with the intent of bringing the good to the market and selling it for a profit.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The truest capitalist finds commodities everywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>So long as he can derive a profit from the product&amp;rsquo;s sale at the market, he does not card about the quality of the product itself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>task of the ancient guildsman, to first and foremost maintain standards of product quality&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Traditional producers were rational in the that their central concern was the quality of their product. The capitalist is not rational in the same sense.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>it is consumers, and consumers alone, who protect the quality of goods. Yet the capitalist always has an incentive to make his products worse and worse, in fact as bad as his market share will bear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The modern economy does not exist to create good products. The end of modern production is profit, through more and more production.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Modern man may be wealthy, but all that wealth is tied to greater and greater dependency on capitalist production.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Third Industrial Revolution, the rise of microchips, electronics, complex financial instruments and inane consumer goods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A producer always benefits from creating dependencies in consumers, whether through brand affection, material necessity, or simply not being able to afford any other. The Third Industrial Revolution, that which brought about digital and electronic technology, brought with it a new kind of dependency, and heralded a new era of socialized property.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>capitalism promotes the tendency towards the creation of the mass. As both producers and consumers, the individuality of the man is slurred.&lt;/li>

The wheel is an extension of the foot, the book is an extension of the eye, clothing an extension of the skin, electric circuitry an extension of the central nervous system.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A medium acts as an extension of man&amp;rsquo;s faculties, and in turn controls those faculties in a novel way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Simply to survive he must employ the social knowledge that is technology. Were it otherwise, he would be nothing but a brute.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once immersed in the new technological environment, removing a man from it resembles a kind of amputation. And if Aristotle and the Scholastics were right, and the soul truly is the material form of the body, then removing such faculties from him is a marring of the soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>new media must form habits, if their effects are not guarded against, they serve to permanently alter men&amp;rsquo;s mental states.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>We desire things in their essence, but we love things as individuals.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We love men not so much for their types but for the perfections achieved by them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is man&amp;rsquo;s unique place in the cosmos never to be at home with himself, never to be sufficient in his own means&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The well-ordered state is but a reflection of a just man, a macrocosm of the happy soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The old form saw man as a kind of clay to be molded, modern man is no subject to be formed, he&amp;rsquo;s one to be created, as if conjuring matter out of nothing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equality as a principle is nothing and can be nothing but an annihilating and depersonalizing force&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>schools do not exist to educate, but to integrate the new protected classes, to socialize according to the programs of the wholistic egalitarian creed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is the city which gives man matter from which as man, the artist of the self, becomes great or small.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The act of forming man is taken to be an act of conjuration, not a creation through medium but the implanting of ideas, the channeling of propaganda and the cultivation of a desired psychology. The subject is perfectly free, wholly deracinated, a soul transcending matter or material, one disincarnate, waiting for the matter that will form him.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-dissolution-of-the-political-form">The Dissolution of the Political Form&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;The Fourth Revolution is charactering by the dissolution of the political form of society, the State, along with the disintegration of the reason, the sovereign faculty of the human soul&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It was the technocracy which allowed for the emasculation and destruction of all productive institutions.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Great art simply cannot be produced in an environment where all men who are not directly employed in the working of the technocracy are maintained in a kind of gestational vat of barbarism, a servile idiocy meant to leave men in a perpetual larval form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All institutions perdure only as a commentary on the former institutions from which take their form, and the empty temples and vacant thrones they inhabit. Though their outwards appearances differ, modern institutions are all formally the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cities still exist but are technically unnecessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The child as he stands is a sentimental object, more akin to a pet than fulfilment of the life&amp;rsquo;s work of man.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>with the ration of man denied, the reason for existence of these institutions dies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>but stands as a spiritual border around every heart. This is the effect of perfectly ideological rule, one in which the &lt;strong>powers that be are only loosely tied to the material, and so the one prerequisite to rule is the ability to control the myths.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Man has no role in his own economic production and provides no real contribution to his culture, and he does not and cannot produce anything in the indefinite and larval state in which he is maintained.

&lt;li>&lt;strong>this was no longer a man who knew well his role within the productive apparatus. He was the universal bourgeois: he produced ostensibly nothing, and what faculties he had were spent wholly or primarily on the task of earning money and keeping it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fascism, as Orwell defined it in 1946, is something not desirable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hitler was a man who adored the first three revolutions, who longed to make himself the Bonaparte of the industrialized masses.

&lt;li>&lt;strong>The object of propaganda must be free from the bonds of nation, party, and creed, but not so free as to able to endure his fragmented state.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Politics in the modern form is little but the question of who is allowed to propagandize the masses.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The process of mass voting - Election Day - is not a reflection of the people&amp;rsquo;s will, but a final determinative test of how the popular will has been managed and controlled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The purpose of propaganda of the old type was to build support for a person, product or a program. Modern propaganda need not promise anything; its primary end is to give its subject the sense that he has place within a given ideological system.&lt;/li>

It &lt;strong>accepted a world no longer led by priests and bishops, but by politicians and celebrities; not theologians but sociologists, not confessors but psychiatrists, scientist and other technicians.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For &lt;strong>true radicalism is intellectual; it is of the rational soul, that which can assert boldly &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;, which can stage out the difference between being and nothingness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The will of the flesh, in contrast, is towards torpor, the giving way to feelings, guesses, probabilities, the hope that quiddity can be found on a Bayesia curve.&lt;/strong> The flush desires that all can be known through the senses, that the world is as it appears, that material reality, tangible, visible, audible, is all that exists.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The Revolution of 2020 is the inflection point in the &lt;strong>transformation of society into a digital thing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Coronavirus could not have been a pandemic if the smartphone had not allowed it to be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>in the hierarchy of being they have eminent pride of place in the fact that they are, that they have waged a war against nonexistence and won, and in fact make themselves glorious, partaking of that high attributes of God. Between zero and one the gap is infinite. The prior revolutions that leveled the pontiff and they layman, king and pleb, cannot compare to the leveling we now undertake: the &lt;strong>eradication of the differences not in kind but of the starkest contrast of them all, between being and non-being.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the modern world our tasks no longer demand physical existence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>their &lt;strong>thoughts quickly or instantly made open to the forces of universal derision or empty praise. Their habits are dulled by constant stimuli, and their most intense experiences are very often not attached to a place nor the attendant sense of touch and taste and smell and dimensional sight, but are only particular moment of time on their phones.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No one can write poetry about digital meeting places.&lt;/strong> Art is interplay of human spirit and Nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world is governed by ideas, but made rich by things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a happy society, idea and thing support one another, creating a bulwark of our virtues and aspirations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What we lose is a connection between the tactile and the spiritual, of quiddity and matter.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="revolution-over-the-biological-human">Revolution over the Biological Human&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The full romp of the Fifth Revolution is found in the reordering of the biological world&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The individual is squelched for the sake of the masses, and a socialized and notional figment is given precedence over the real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Liberalism is the process of enshrining a system of socialized morality. This always involves the diminution of the moral significance of the individual. So we see &lt;strong>with the Protestant Revolution that the faculties of free will are vitiated, and the power of the individual diminished among the vast mass of the elect; so with the French Revolution the individual&amp;rsquo;s role within the state is diminished for the abstraction notion of the citizen; and with the Third Revolution, the means a man&amp;rsquo;s material wellbeing, namely his utilization of property, is diminished following the transformation of property through the industrial revolution. So we see with the Fifth Revolution, with man&amp;rsquo;s individual health becoming something to be sacrificed to the socialized and notional versions of societal health.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>man is at his highest a moral being: He who is able to cognize and choose the course of his life. It is this attribute which makes man distinct from herd animals, his nature and soul that can damn or save him. Such conceptions were first attacked with the Protestant Revolution, the first great socialization of man&lt;/strong>, and one conducted against his highest attribute, which is the tutelage of his own soul. This was the first great disorientation of self, and in time for Protestant ruling powers and the subject man no longer saw himself as unique individual cognizable apart from the social order. So it was further &lt;strong>with the Second Revolution, when man&amp;rsquo;s position and his accordant rights within the state were erased with the Declaration of Rights of Man. So it continued with the Third Revolution, when the rights of property, which are the basis for civil government, were etiolated, and his position in the social order made dependent on the will of the industrialist.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Men&amp;rsquo;s moral rights arise out of his material circumstance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All evil is perversion, and the Revolution is nothing but a perversion of the Everlasting and Immanent.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The modern young person is a monster.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to combat this beast of banality? &lt;strong>There is no return to Nature, because man is not natural and never has been, nor ever could be. He is a creature who by definition transforms Nature, who contorts Nature in order to extend his own faculties.&lt;/strong> Man is not man without art, if he is not contorting Nature to his will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Backwardness in technology is always the rejection of some perfection&lt;/strong>, a power of man abjured.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All men are created as rational souls, with personhood and individuality unfathomable. Yet they accept this great gift of selfhood only reluctantly against the temptation of the herd and of the flesh. It is the cultivation of the individual that must be sought above all, for it is and always has been the end of the Revolution to attack man&amp;rsquo;s individuality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The uncritical acceptance of technology is the Revolution in its purest form&lt;/strong>. Technology can be used to foster man&amp;rsquo;s individuality and his greatness, but this requires concerted limitations on its use.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>These is no fodder for greatness amongst these herd animals, these beats of caprice who have no ability to rule themselves, these natural slaves who adore their slavery.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>return to God, not as an amorphous force of benevolence or even the creator and protector of the moral order, as the mere social conservative and the modern civil religionist can abide, but as God as He is, God Incarnate, the Word made flesh. For the evil of the present age stands against not only against the nature of Christ as God, but of Christ as man. The Incarnation, the uniting of God and man, was the positive means of our salvation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the only right response to God is to adore Him. It is this fundamental response to value which must guide all else. Just as anything in existence must beloved to be fully participated in, just as any greatness, even material greatness, can arse only through love: that any family can be fostered, that any city can be founded, that any civilization can be reformed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To properly adore God is to truly love oneself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our society cannot be remade until men are once again recognized as small bastion of the eternal, as warriors in life and soldiers in slaying of death.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No good government is possible if it does not acknowledge that his &lt;strong>spirit is no free-floating, immaterial thing, but bound in most intimate marriage to material reality through his own flesh.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Man is a spirit incarnate, dust ennobled by life in God.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>approaching where he is most apparent, tangible to finite sense yet adorable in infinite contemplation: In the Eucharist, where Truth and eternity cannot be deformed, where Being begins and ends, whose reception cannot be simpler but whose heights cannot be surpassed. &lt;strong>It is only here that selfhood can be protected, in the Incarnate Christ where humanity finds the end of the Creature and the wholeness of the Creator, against which the daemon of the Revolution will fall and the Immaculate Heart will triumph.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Staying positive is a fallacy. &lt;strong>The trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns with your values.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Good values are 1) reality-based 2) socially constructive 3) immediate and controllable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bad values are 1) superstitious 2) socially destructive 3) not immediate and controllable.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Growth is an endlessly iterative process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people become so obsessed with being &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; about their life that they never end-up actually living it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Certainty is the enemy of growth.&lt;/strong> Being wrong is the opportunity for growth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search for doubt: about our own beliefs, own feelings, about what the future might hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves.&lt;/strong> Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we&amp;rsquo;re wrong all the time.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Human mind is capable of coming up with and believing in a bunch of BS that isn&amp;rsquo;t real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our brains are meaning machines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brains are imperfect. We mistake things we see and hear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we create meaning for ourselves, our brains are designed to hold on to that meaning (=belief).&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="be-careful-what-you-believe">Be Careful What You Believe&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our memories work like the telephone game&lt;/strong> - you say something in one&amp;rsquo;s person ear and it gets passed through lie ten people and then what the last person hears is completely unrelated to what you started with.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our brain is always biased toward what we feel to be true in that moment.&lt;/strong> So when we have a great relationship with our sister, we&amp;rsquo;ll interpret most of our memories about her in a positive light. But when the relationship sours, we&amp;rsquo;ll often come to see those exact same memories differently, reinventing them in a such way as to explain our present-day anger towards her.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our mind&amp;rsquo;s biggest priority when processing experiences is to interpret them in such a way that they will cohere with all of our previous experiences, feelings and beliefs&lt;/strong> (=Penelope&amp;rsquo;s loom).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In an effort to achieve coherence, our mind will sometimes invent false memories. By linking our present experiences with that imagines past, our mind allows to maintain whatever meaning we already established.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uncertainty removes our judgement of others. It is the root of all progress and growth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before we can look at or values and prioritizations and change them into better ones, we must first become uncertain of our current values. We must intellectually strip them away, see their faults and biases, see how they don&amp;rsquo;t fit in with much of the rest of thew world.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t say find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that&amp;rsquo;s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgement and accepting of the differences of the others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="kill-yourself">Kill Yourself&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or undiscovered genius. Instead measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give up the entitlement and your belief that you&amp;rsquo;re somehow owed something by this world.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Aristotle: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entitlement is hard to admit. It hurts.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>How? It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as just doing it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emotions defined my reality. Because it felt like people didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk to me, I came to believe that people didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you choose a new value, you&amp;rsquo;re choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Then act despite of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start simple You&amp;rsquo;re going to feel as though you don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. But we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed this: you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-do-something-principle">The &amp;ldquo;Do Something&amp;rdquo; Principle&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Action isn&amp;rsquo;t just the effect of motivation. It is also the cause of it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we follow the &amp;ldquo;do something&amp;rdquo; principle, failure feels unimportant.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can become your own source of motivation. Action is always within reach.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-saying-no">The Importance of Saying No&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unadulterated expression. Honestly in the truest sense of the world. Communication with no conditions, no strings attached, no ulterior motive, no sales job, no desperate attempt to be liked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; West, my Russian teacher continued, there existed an abundance of economic opportunity - so much economic opportunity that it became far more valuable to present yourself in a certain way, even if it was false, than to actually be that way. Trust lost its value. Appearances and salesmanship became more advantageous forms of expressions. Knowing a lot of people superficially was more beneficial than knowing a few people closely.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="rejection-makes-your-life-better">Rejection Makes Your Life Better&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Avoiding rejection gives us short-term pleasure by making us rudderless and directionless in the long term.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To truly appreciate something, you must confine yourself to it. There&amp;rsquo;s a certain level of joy and meaning that you reach in life only when you&amp;rsquo;ve spent decades investing in a single relationship, a single craft, a single career. And you cannot achieve those decades without rejecting the alternatives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rejecting is an inherent and necessary part of maintaining our values. If we reject nothing, we essentially have no identity at all&lt;/strong>.
Rejection is an important and crucial life skill.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="boundaries">Boundaries&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Until the mid-nineteenth century or so, love was seen as unnecessary and potentially dangerous psychological impediment to the more important things in life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Romantic love is kind of like cocaine.&lt;/strong> It stimulates the same brain parts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other. Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other&amp;rsquo;s support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People can&amp;rsquo;t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try, because that won&amp;rsquo;t make you happy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mark of an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each other&amp;rsquo;s problems in order to feel good about themselves. Healthy relationship is when to people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The victim, if he really loved the saver, would say &amp;ldquo;Look, this is my problem, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to fix it for me. Just support me while I fix it myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the saver really wanted to save the victim, the saver would say &amp;ldquo;Look, you&amp;rsquo;re blaming others for your own problems, deal with it yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-build-trust">How to Build Trust&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The last person I should ever have to censor myself with is the person I love.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When our highest priority is always to make ourselves feel good, or the partner, then nobody ends up feeling good.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without conflict, there can be no trust. Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who&amp;rsquo;s there just for the benefits.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Conflict is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a healthy relationship.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behaviour over time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="freedom-through-commitment">Freedom Through Commitment&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are some experiences that you can have only when you lived in the same place for five years, when you&amp;rsquo;ve been with the same person for over a decade, when you&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the same skill or craft for half of your lifetime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to reject all but the very best people and experiences and values in my life. I shut down all my business projects and decided to focus on (writing) full-time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you stress about chasing more?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ernest Becker: Denial of Death (book).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion, politics, sport, art, and technological innovation are the result of people&amp;rsquo;s immortality projects. Becker argues that wars and revolutions and mass murder occur when one group of people&amp;rsquo;s immortality projects rub against another group&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death - the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life&amp;rsquo;s frivolous ambitions - we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-sunny-side-of-death">The Sunny Side of Death&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mark Twain: &amp;ldquo;The fear of death follows the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is nothing to be afraid. Ever.&lt;/strong> And reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the years - is the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Office during the day has become the last place where people get their work done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Required: ability to be alone with your thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop commuting your life away - commutes make you fat, stressed and miserable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Escaping 9am-5pm: synchronous -&amp;gt; asynchronous&lt;/li>
&lt;li>End of city monopoly
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Industrialism (factories): gather a large number of people into small area.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>life need not be divided into arbitrary phases: work and retirement&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talent isn&amp;rsquo;t bound by the hubs
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not about the money - promote quality of life, getting best people available&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re struggling with trust issues, you&amp;rsquo;ve made a poor hiring decision. We have no desire to be babysitters during the day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people want to work as long as it&amp;rsquo;s stimulating and fulfilling. If you&amp;rsquo;re stuck in a dead-end job that has no prospects of being either, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need just a remote position, you need a new job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forcing everyone into the office every day is an organizational SPoF.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reptilian resistance is not rational but deeply emotional. Fight or flight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good for hours of overlap to avoid collaboration delays and feel like a team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing is believing: Record a screencast (animated gif, youtube etc.) and narrate the experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings and managers - are actually the greatest causes of work not getting done at the office.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="big-business">Big business&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many big businesses get away with staggering amounts of inefficiency and bureaucracy and seem fine for years. What you need is confidence that you see a smarter way.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="culture">Culture&lt;/h3>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="i-need-an-answer-now">I need an answer now&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>too many interruptions - little gets done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is nothing more arrogant than taking up someone else&amp;rsquo;s time with a question you don&amp;rsquo;t need an answer right now. Email -&amp;gt; IM -&amp;gt; telephone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ASAP-free. Use that calm to be even more productive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>weekly discussion thread with the subject &amp;ldquo;What have you been working on?&amp;rdquo; Everyone contributes a few lines about past week and what&amp;rsquo;s intended for the next week. It&amp;rsquo;s not a precise, rigorous estimation process. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to deal with coordination. It simply aims to make everyone feel like they&amp;rsquo;re in the same galley and not their own little rowboat.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First, when pitching business, let the prospective client know up front that you don&amp;rsquo;t live where they live.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second, provide references before the client even asks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Third, show them work often.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fourth, be very available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lastly, get the client involved and let them follow along. Make sure they feel this is their project too. So their anxieties and fears will be replaced by excitement and anticipation.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>everyone gets a company credit card and is told to &amp;ldquo;spend wisely&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no need to ask for permission to go on vacation. Just put in in the calendar and coordinate with coworkers.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>separate the clothes you wear depending whether you&amp;rsquo;re in work/play mode&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>divide the day into chunks like: catch-up, collaboration and serious work&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>dedicated home office&lt;/strong>. No checking work email or just getting a little more done in the living room or your bedroom&lt;/li>

If you like the notes, please consider buying the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="first">First&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="its-crazy-at-work">It&amp;rsquo;s Crazy at Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Workday is being sliced into tiny moments by an onslaught of distractions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unhealthy obsession with growth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it&amp;rsquo;s a mark of stupidity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The answer isn&amp;rsquo;t more hours, it&amp;rsquo;s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. Fewer distractions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No growth at-all-costs. No false busyness. No ego-driven goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="your-company-is-a-product">Your Company Is a Product&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do people who work here know how to use the company? Is it simple?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We work on projects for six weeks at a time, then we take two weeks off from scheduled work to roam and decompress.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="curb-your-ambition">Curb Your Ambition&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="bury-the-hustle">Bury the Hustle&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You aren&amp;rsquo;t more worthy in defeat or victory because you sacrificed everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not very likely to find that key insight or breakthrough idea north of the 14th hour in the day. &lt;strong>Creativity, progress, and impact do not yield to brute force.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="happy-pacifists">Happy Pacifists&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Just serve their customers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All is fair in love and war. Except this isn&amp;rsquo;t love, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t war. It&amp;rsquo;s business.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We come in peace. We don&amp;rsquo;t have imperial ambitions. We aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to dominate an industry or a market. We wish everyone well. To get ours, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to take theirs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doubling, tripling, quadrupling our market share doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mark Twain: Comparison is the death of joy.&lt;/strong> What others do has no bearing on what we&amp;rsquo;re able to do, what we want to do, or what we choose to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The opposite of conquering the world isn&amp;rsquo;t failure. It&amp;rsquo;s participation. Being one of many options in a market is a virtue that allows customers to have a real choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the end of the day, would you rather win an imaginary context by throwing sand in your competitors&amp;rsquo; faces or by simply forgetting about them and making the best damn product you know how?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="our-goals-no-goals">Our Goals: No Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Simply do the best work we can on a daily basis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals are fake. You don&amp;rsquo;t need something fake to do something real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals are made-up numbers that function as a source of unnecessary stress until they&amp;rsquo;re reached or abandoned. Produce expectations.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dont-change-the-world">Don&amp;rsquo;t Change the World&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you lift a tremendous burden off yourself and the people around you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ambition hyperinflation: it&amp;rsquo;s no longer about making a great product/service. It&amp;rsquo;s about this BRAND_NEW THING CHANGES EVERYTHING.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="make-it-up-as-you-go">Make It Up as You Go&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We didn&amp;rsquo;t start the business with a plan, and we don&amp;rsquo;t run the business by a plan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every six weeks or so we decide what we&amp;rsquo;ll be working on next.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Short term plan - you change your mind often. And that&amp;rsquo;s a huge relief. Long term planning instills a false sense of security.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best information you&amp;rsquo;ll ever have about a decision is at the moment of execution.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="comfys-cool">Comfy&amp;rsquo;s Cool&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The idea that you have to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone is the kind of supposedly self-evident nonsense you&amp;rsquo;ll often find in corporate manifestos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the time, if you&amp;rsquo;re uncomfortable with something, its&amp;rsquo; because it isn&amp;rsquo;t right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you get into the habit of suppressing all discomfort, you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose yourself, your manners, and your morals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being comfortable in your zone is essential to being calm.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="defend-your-time">Defend Your Time&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="8s-enough-40s-plenty">8&amp;rsquo;s Enough, 40&amp;rsquo;s Plenty&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Most people don&amp;rsquo;t have 8h a day. Time is stolen by meetings, conference calls and other distractions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of what we think we have to do, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to do at all. It&amp;rsquo;s a choice and often a poor one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you cut out what&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary, you&amp;rsquo;re left with what you need.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="protectionism">Protectionism&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>top responsibility to protect our employee&amp;rsquo;s time and attention. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect great work if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a full day&amp;rsquo;s attention to devote it. Partial attention is no attention at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No status meetings at Basecamp. We ask people to write updates daily or weekly for others to read.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings break time into &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-quality-of-an-hour">The Quality of an Hour&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Look at your hours. If they&amp;rsquo;re a bunch of fractions, who or what is doing the division?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When was the last time you had three or four completely uninterrupted hours to yourself and your work?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="effective--productive">Effective &amp;gt; Productive&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Productivity is for machines, not for people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When people focus on productivity, they end up focusing on being busy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being productive is about occupying your time. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is perfectly OK to have nothing to do. Or, better yet, nothing worth doing. &lt;strong>Not doing something that isn&amp;rsquo;t worth doing is a wonderful way to spend your time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-outwork-myth">The Outwork Myth&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A great work ethic isn&amp;rsquo;t about working whenever you&amp;rsquo;re called upon. It&amp;rsquo;s about doing what you say you&amp;rsquo;re going to do, putting in a fair day&amp;rsquo;s work, respecting your work, respecting the customer, respecting coworkers, not wasting time, not creating unnecessary work for other people, and not being a bottleneck. &lt;strong>Work ethic is about being a fundamentally good person that others can count on and enjoy working with.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop equating work ethic with excessive work hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="work-doesnt-happen-at-work">Work Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Happen at Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you really need to get work done you rarely go into the office.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modern-day offices have become interruption factories.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are working longer and later because they can&amp;rsquo;t get work done at work anymore!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All subject-matter expects at Basecamp now publish office hours. Like in academia. It&amp;rsquo;s up to each expert to decide their availability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you do when you have a question on Monday and someone&amp;rsquo;s office hours aren&amp;rsquo;t until Thursday? You wait, that&amp;rsquo;s what you do.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="calendar-tetris">Calendar Tetris&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You just can&amp;rsquo;t reach into someone&amp;rsquo;s calendar, find an open slot, and plat your flag.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings should be the last resort, especially big ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When someones takes your time, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost them anything, but it costs you everything.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-presence-prison">The Presence Prison&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When everyone knows you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;available&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s an invitation to be interrupted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if you need something from someone and don&amp;rsquo;t know whether they&amp;rsquo;re available? Just ask them. If the respond, then you have what you need.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ill-get-back-to-you-whenever">I&amp;rsquo;ll Get Back to You Whenever&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Common thinking: If I can write you quickly, you can get back to me quickly, right? Technically right, practically wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Almost everything can wait. And almost everything should.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The culture of eventual response rather than immediate response.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t get back to you quickly, it&amp;rsquo;s not because they&amp;rsquo;re ignoring you - it&amp;rsquo;s probably because they are working. Don&amp;rsquo;t you have some other work to do while you wait?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="fomo-jomo">FOMO? JOMO!&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fear of missing out? Joy of missing out!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no reason everyone needs to attempt to know everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on at our company.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="feed-your-culture">Feed Your Culture&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="were-not-family">We&amp;rsquo;re Not Family&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The company is not &amp;ldquo;our baby&amp;rdquo;. It is our product. We&amp;rsquo;ll make it great, but we won&amp;rsquo;t take a bullet for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When executives talk about how their company is really a big ol&amp;rsquo; family, beware. Their motive is rather more likely to be a unidirectional sacrifice: yours.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best companies aren&amp;rsquo;t families. They&amp;rsquo;re supporters of families.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="theyll-do-as-you--do">They&amp;rsquo;ll Do as You Do&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A leader who sets an example of self-sacrifice can&amp;rsquo;t help but ask self-sacrifice of others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Workaholism is a contagious disease. Disseminate calm instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-trust-battery">The Trust Battery&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is charged at 50% when people are first hired. Every time you work with someone at the company, the trust between the two of you is either charged or discharged, based on things like whether you deliver on what you promise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is a summary of all interactions to date.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Having good relationships at work takes, err, work.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The worst thing you can do is pretend that interpersonal feelings don&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dont-be-the-last-to-know">Don&amp;rsquo;t Be the Last to Know&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the boss really wants to know what&amp;rsquo;s going on: They have to ask. Not vague, self-congratulatory BS questions like &amp;ldquo;What can we do even better?&amp;rdquo;, but hard ones like &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s something nobody dares to talk about?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Are you afraid of anything at work?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;It there anything you worked on recently you wish you could do over?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The higher you go in an organization, the less you&amp;rsquo;ll know what it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>really&lt;/em> like. The CEO is usually the last to know. &lt;strong>With great power comes great ignorance&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-owners-word-weights-a-ton">The Owner&amp;rsquo;s Word Weights a Ton&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is no such thing as a casual suggestion when it comes from the owner of the business.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It takes great restraint as the leader of an organization not to keep lobbying ideas at everyone else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evading responsibility with a &amp;ldquo;But it&amp;rsquo;s just a suggestion&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t going to calm the waters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="low-hanging-fruit-can-still-be-out-of-reach">Low-Hanging Fruit Can Still Be Out of Reach&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the further away you&amp;rsquo;re from the fruit, the lower it looks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Declaring that an unfamiliar task will yield low-hanging fruit is almost always an admission that you have little insight.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dont-cheat-sleep">Don&amp;rsquo;t Cheat Sleep&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Continued sleep deprivation batters your IQ and saps your creativity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get a good eight hours night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your brain is still active at night. It works through matters you can&amp;rsquo;t address during the day.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="out-of-whack">Out of Whack&lt;/h2>
&lt;h2 id="hire-the-work-not-the-resume">Hire the Work, Not the Resume&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whenever someone joins (or leaves) a team, the old team is gone.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can&amp;rsquo;t land a job at Basecamp based on your resume. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ve to be good with people. Someone the rest of the team wants to work with, not just someone they&amp;rsquo;d tolerate.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re looking for candidates that are interesting and different from the people we already have.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hire finalists for a week, pay them for their time and ask them to do a sample project for us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid hiring an imaginary person.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="nobody-hits-the-ground-running">Nobody Hits the Ground Running&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>unless you hire someone straight out of an identical role at an identical company, they&amp;rsquo;re highly unlikely to be instantly up to speed and able to deliver anyway.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The quickest way to disappointment is to set unrealistic expectations.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ignore-the-talent-war">Ignore the Talent War&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Talent isn&amp;rsquo;t worth fighting over. It&amp;rsquo;s not a fixed, scared resource. It rarely even transplants well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you do pay attention to having the best environment, you can grow your own beautiful orchids with patience. No need to steal them from your neighbor!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at people&amp;rsquo;s work, not at their diploma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nurturing untapped potential is fare more exhilarating than finding someone who&amp;rsquo;s already at their peak.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dont-negotiate-salaries">Don&amp;rsquo;t Negotiate Salaries&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>most people just don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy haggling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same. Equal work, equal pay.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once every year we review market rates and issues raises automatically. Our target is to pay everyone at the company the top 10% of the market regardless of their role.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t pay traditional bonuses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are no stock options.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve vowed to distribute 5% of the proceeds to all current employees if we ever sell the company. It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant surprise, it&amp;rsquo;s not compensation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If total profits grow year over year, we&amp;rsquo;ll distribute 25% of that growth to employees that year. This isn&amp;rsquo;t tied to role, it&amp;rsquo;s not about individual performance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some amount of turnover is a good thing, but salary shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the main driver for most people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hiring and training people is not only expensive, but draining.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="benefits-who">Benefits Who?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>fancy benefits blur the lines between work and play to the point it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dinners, lunches, game rooms, late nights - these mainly exist at companies that work 60_ hours a week, not 40. Sounds more like a bribe, than benefits.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Benefits benefit the employees, not the company:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>fully paid vacations every year for everyone who&amp;rsquo;s been with the company for more than a year&lt;/li>
&lt;li>three-day weekends all summer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>30-day-paid sabbaticals every three years&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$1,000 per year continuing-education stipend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$2,000 per year charity match&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$100 monthly fitness allowance&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not a single benefit aimed at trapping people at the office.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="library-rules">Library Rules&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When sales or service people, who often need to be loud and jovial on the phone, have to share accommodations with people who need long stretches of quiet, you&amp;rsquo;re not only destroying productivity, you&amp;rsquo;re forming resentment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Distractions spread like viruses. Before you know it, everyone&amp;rsquo;s infected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rather than thinking of it as an office, we think of it as a library.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve designated a handful of small rooms in the center of the office where people can go if they need to work on something together or make a private call.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="no-fakecations">No Fakecations&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The whole purpose of a vacation is to get away. Work should not be on your mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fakecations put employees on a leash - liable to be yanked back and pulled into work at any moment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unlimited vacation is a stressful benefit because it is not truly unlimited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ambiguity breeds anxiety.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world will still be standing when you return.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="calm-goodbyes">Calm Goodbyes&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A dismissal opens a vacuum, and unless you fill that vacuum with facts, it&amp;rsquo;ll quickly fill with rumors, conjecture, anxiety and fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever someone leaves Basecamp, an immediate goodbye announcement is sent out companywide. It is written be either the person leaving or their manager.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="dissect-your-process">Dissect Your Process&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="the-wrong-time-for-real-time">The Wrong Time for Real-Time&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Following group chat at work is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda. It&amp;rsquo;s completely exhausting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it comes to chat, we have two primary rules of thumb: &amp;ldquo;Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s important, slow down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chat is a great as a small slice but not the whole pie of communication.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dreadlines">Dreadlines&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Without a fixed, believable deadline, you can&amp;rsquo;t work calmly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Few things are so demoralizing as working on projects with no end in sight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You can&amp;rsquo;t fix a deadline and then add more work to it.&lt;/strong> Our projects can only get smaller over time, not larger.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not the CEO, not the CTO. The team that&amp;rsquo;s doing the work has control over the work. They wield the &amp;ldquo;scope hammer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our deadlines are based on budgets, not estimates. &lt;strong>Humans suck at estimating. But it turns out that people are quite good at setting and spending budgets.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dont-be-a-knee-jerk">Don&amp;rsquo;t be a Knee-Jerk&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When we present work, it&amp;rsquo;s almost always written up first. A complete idea in the form of a carefully composed multipage document. Illustrated, whenever possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t want reactions. We don&amp;rsquo;t want first impressions. We don&amp;rsquo;t want knee-jerks. We want considered feedback. Read over it. Twice. Three times even. Sleep on it. Take your time and gather and prsent thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t meet, write. Don&amp;rsquo;t react, consider.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="watch-out-for-12-day-weeks">Watch Out for 12-Day Weeks&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ship software on Monday, not Friday.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-new-normal">The New Normal&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Normal comes on quick. First it starts an outlier. Some behaviour you don&amp;rsquo;t love, but tolerate. Then someone else follows suit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="bad-habits-beat-good-intentions">Bad Habits Beat Good Intentions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What we do repeatedly hardens into habits. The longer you carry on, the tougher is to change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Later is where excuse live. Make change now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="independences">Independences&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We want our teams to be able to glide by one another independently rather than tripped up in lockstep. Things should fit together rather than stick together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ship things when they&amp;rsquo;re ready rather than when they&amp;rsquo;re coordinated. If it&amp;rsquo;s ready for the web, ship it. iOS will catch up when they&amp;rsquo;re ready. Customers get the value when it&amp;rsquo;s ready wherever, not when it&amp;rsquo;s ready everywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t tie more knots, cut more ties. The fewer bonds, the better.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="commitment-not-consensus">Commitment, Not Consensus&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you get a bunch of people in a room under the assumption that consensus is the only way out, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a war of attrition. Whoever can keep arguing the longest, stands the best chance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good decisions are always going to be the product of consultation, evidence, arguments and debate. But the only sustainable method in business is to have them made by individuals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I disagree, but let&amp;rsquo;s commit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow everyone to be heard and then turn the decision over to one person to make the final call. It&amp;rsquo;s their job to listen, consider, contemplate and decide.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The final decision should be explained clearly to everyone involved. &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s not just decide and go, it&amp;rsquo;s decide, explain and go.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="compromise-on-quality">Compromise on Quality&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Attempting to be indiscriminately great at everything is a foolish waste of energy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put efforts into separating what really matters from what soft of matters from what doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="narrow-as-you-go">Narrow as You Go&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Always keeping the door open to radical changes only invites chaos and second-guessing. Confidently close that door.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Answer to &lt;strong>new ideas that arrive too late: You&amp;rsquo;ll just have to wait.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-not-nothing">Why Not Nothing?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Nothing&amp;rdquo; should be always on the table.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s easier to mess up something that&amp;rsquo;s working well than it is go genuinely improve it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="worst-practices">Worst Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What counts as the best practice for a company of 10,000 is very rarely so for a company of 10.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many best practices are purely folklore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Best practices imply that there&amp;rsquo;s a single answer to whatever question you&amp;rsquo;re facing. It implies that you really don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice in the matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Best practices are like training wheels.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whatever-it-doesnt-take">Whatever It Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Take&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reasonable expectations are out the window with whatever it takes. So you know you&amp;rsquo;re going to grossly underestimate the difficulty and complexity required to make it happen.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="have-less-to-do">Have Less to Do&lt;/h2>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="threes-company">Three&amp;rsquo;s Company&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Two programmers and one designer. If not three, it&amp;rsquo;s one or two rather than four or five.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three is a wedge. Three has a sharp point. It&amp;rsquo;s an odd number and there are no ties. It&amp;rsquo;s powerful enough to make a dent, but weak enough to to break what isn&amp;rsquo;t broken.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Just like work expands to fill the time available, work expands to fill the team available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three keeps you honest. It tampers your ambition in all the right way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three people can talk directly with one another without introducing hearsay.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="stick-with-it">Stick With It&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="know-no">Know No&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No is easier to do, yes is easier to say.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No is no to one thing, yes is no to a thousand things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No is a precision instrument, yes is a blunt object.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say no to one thing, it&amp;rsquo;s a choice that breeds choices. Tomorrow you can be as open to new opportunities as you were today.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say yes now, it&amp;rsquo;s harder to say no later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No is calm but hard, yes is easy but a flurry.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Promises pile up like dept, and they accrue interest, too. The longer you wait to fulfill them, the more they cost to pay off and the worse the regret.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>People don&amp;rsquo;t like to have their grievances downplayed or dismissed. When that happens, even the smallest irritation can turn into an obsessive crusade.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s no big deal&amp;rdquo; or the token that says &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world.&amp;rdquo; Whichever token you pick, they&amp;rsquo;ll take the other.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Everyone wants to be heard and respected. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter all that much whether you ultimately think you&amp;rsquo;re right and they&amp;rsquo;re wrong. Arguing with heated feelings will just increase the burn.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>core process: taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights the user.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>QWAN - quality without a name. Don&amp;rsquo;t preach, just tell/do what works.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pragmatic -&amp;gt; lat. (pragmaticus) -&amp;gt; greek &amp;ldquo;to do&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are no easy answers There is no such thing as best solution, tool language or OS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be weeded to any particular technology but have broad enough background and experience base to allow to choose good solution in any particular situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-makes-a-pragmatic-programmer">What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Early Adopter &amp;amp; Fast Adapter&lt;/strong> - instinct for technologies and techniques, love to try things out, grasp it quickly and integrate with the rest of the knowledge. Your confidence is born out of experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inquisitive&lt;/strong> - you tend to ask questions (TODO). You are a pack rat for little facts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Realistic&lt;/strong> - try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jack of all trades&lt;/strong> - always able to move on to new areas and new challenges.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>TIP 1: care about your craft&lt;br>
TIP 2: Think! About your work. Think what you are doing while you&amp;rsquo;re doing it. Never run on autopilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing Python</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-12-13-python__testing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-12-13-python__testing/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Writing code without tests in general is going to lead to problems down the line.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choreographing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the worst traps a developer can fall into is writing a bunch of code and then going back and testing it all at the end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With the advent of social networks and the ever-increasing pressure of media attention, defects in your code could be costly to both you and your reputation or that of any company you may represent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The key advantage of writing tests, especially as part of the development process, is that testing gives you confidence in your code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="chapter-2---writing-unittests">Chapter 2 - writing unittests&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AN APPLICATION IS one of the great examples of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With a good test suite in place, refactoring is easy because you know when you change your code you haven’t broken any previous behavior.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before you write any code you give thought to the kind of tests you will be writing to check the methods will work as expected.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>assertEqual()
with assertRaises(Exception)
assertAlmostEqual(1, 1.2, delta=0.5)
assertAlmostEqual(1, 1.00001, places=4)
assertDictContainsSubset(expected, actual, msg=None)
assertDictEqual(d1, d2, msg=None)
assertGreater(a, b, msg=None)
assertGreaterEqual(a, b, msg=None)
assertIn(member, container, msg=None)
assertNotNone(obj, msg=None)
assertLess(a, b, msg=None)
assertItemsEqual(a, b, msg=None)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unit tests should be placed under a &lt;code>test/unit&lt;/code> directory at the top level of your project folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All unit test files should mirror the name of the file they are testing, with &lt;code>_test&lt;/code> as the suffix.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example:
{% highlight python %}
import unittest&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>nahnať strach synovi (dať mu lekciu) musí niekto iný ako otec, ktorý ho má ochraňovať (Iron John: kráľovi muži).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>od malička sa učíme popisu sveta, až si ho osvojíme a v ňom žijeme (matrix) a stratíme pojem o čare reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rád hodne chodím.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mentor: budeš mi platiť za môj čas tvojím časom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nikdy nič nepije, ani pivo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pre všetko, čo robíme, je nezbytná iba jedna vec - Duch!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="2---vymazať-osobnú-históriu">2 - Vymazať osobnú históriu&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>nemám žiadnu dennú rutinu&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď nemáš osobnú históriu, nemusíš nič vysvetľovať a nikto nie je sklamaný, tým, čo robíš. najlepšie je celú osobnú históriu vymazať, lebo ťa to zbaví tiaže, čo si myslia druhí.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>lož je ložou len vtedy, ak máš osobný príbeh&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>nutkanie všetko vysvetľovať -&amp;gt; osobný príbeh&lt;/strong> -&amp;gt; !sloboda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ukazovať ľudom len čo im chceš ukázať, ale nikdy presne nehovoriť, ako to robíš.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď nie je nič isté, si stále v strehu, na špičkách. Nevedieť, kde sa skrýva králik je viac vzrušujúce, ako keď sa tvárime, že všetko vieme.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="3---strata-vlastnej-dôležitosti">3 - Strata vlastnej dôležitosti&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>máš v sebe moc násilia, &lt;strong>berieš sa príliš vážne.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>všímať si, čo hovorí svet okolo nás znameniami.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>si tak dôležitý, že si dovolíš opustiť všetko, čo nejde podľa tvojich predstáv. to je slabosť, nie sila. oddeľuje nás to od všetkého. nedokážeme tak doceniť svet a jeho tajuplnosť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>keď sa rozprávaš s rastlinou, slova nie sú dôležite, ale to, čo cítiš.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hovor na rastliny, aj pred druhými, až dokedy nestratíš pocit vlastnej dôležitosti. sme si s nimi rovní.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tvoja chytrosť robí z teba väčšieho hlupáka, než som si myslel.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>ako sa človek môže pokladať za dôležitého, keď vie, že naňho čaká smrť.&lt;/strong> ak si netrpezlivý, obráť sa do lava, uvidíš svoju smrť a požiadaj ju o radu. smrť ti povie: &amp;ldquo;ešte som na teba nesiahla.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="5---prijímať-zodpovednosť">5 - Prijímať zodpovednosť&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>nemáš čas na mizerné a malicherné myšlienky, ak je smrť blízko.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vysvetľovať nie je treba. jedine, čo sa počíta sú činy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>nemám pochybnosti, ani výčitky. všetko, čo robím, robím, lebo som sa preto rozhodol a nesiem za to zodpovednosť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ak by si prijímal zodpovednosť za otcové rozhodnutie chodiť plávať o šiestej, by si išiel buď sám, alebo by si ho poslal do haja, keď by si prekukol jeho triky. ty si nespravil nič a preto si slaboch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>celý život si sťažuješ, lebo neprijímaš zodpovednosť. &lt;strong>prijať zodpovednosť znamená, že si kvôli tomu ochotný aj umrieť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>neprimal zodpovednosť za svoje rozhodnutia a preto ho tento trápny omyl hrozne rozčúlil. očakával, že niečo ziska a nezískal nič.&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="6---stať-sa-lovcom">6 - Stať sa lovcom&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>je mi jedno, čo vidíš, dôležité je, čo cítiš.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sú dobre miesta a sú zle miesta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>najlepší lovci nelovia radi, oni proste lovia dobre a to je celé.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>lovec nikdy nič neponechá na náhode.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lov bol jednou z najväčších veci, ktoré ľudia dokázali vykonať. všetci lovci museli byť mocní ľudia. lovci museli mat veľa sily už od začiatku, aby vydržali tento tvrdý život. kedysi každý vedel, že byt lovcom znamená byt najlepší.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(pashupati)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="7---byť-neprístupný">7 - Byť neprístupný&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>prečo by mal byť svet taký, aký si myslíš, že je? kto ti dal oprávnenie?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lovec využíva sily skryte v prírode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tajomstvo veľkých lovcov - raz sú prístupní a raz nie, podľa toho ako sa vinie ich cesta.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nemá zmysel sa skrývať, keď všetci vedia, že sa skrývaš. musíš sa odobrať z prostriedku rušnej cesty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>v tvojom živote bola raz jedna veľmi významná blondínka. už nie je. z jediného dôvodu - &lt;strong>bol si príliš dostupný. vždy si bol na dosah a žil si úplne rutinne.&lt;/strong> jedine, čo vám nakoniec zostalo bola nuda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>umenie loviť je schopnosť stať sa neprístupným. byť neprístupný znamená, že sa sveta okolo seba dotýkaš len zriedka.&lt;/strong> nezoberieš si päť prepelíc, ale dve. neodlomíš vetvičku len tak. nevystavíš sa vetru bez oprávnenia. nezneužívaš a nevysávaš ľudí. &lt;strong>zámerne sa vyhýbaš tomu, aby si vyčerpával seba alebo druhých.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>lovec vie, že vždy a znovu naláka zver do pasce a tak si nerobí starosti. robiť si starosti znamená byť prístupný. robiť si starosti znamená, že začneš na niečom ľpieť a ak na niečom ľpieš, musíš vyčerpať každého a všetko, na čom ľpieš.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>je neprístupný, pretože svoj svet nevysáva. ľahko naň zaťuká, zostane v ňom ako dlho potrebuje a potom sa rýchlo presune a nezostane po ňom ani stopa. využíva svoj svet striedmo, jedno či sa jedna o rastliny, ľudí, zvieratá, či sily. svoj svet dôverne pozná a napriek tomu je preň neprístupný.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="8---prerušiť-mechanický-chod-života">8 - Prerušiť mechanický chod života&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>spontánnosť. Don Juan zahúkal ako továrenská siréna na obedňajšiu prestávku.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>zámerne ma vydesil svojím neočakávaným chovaním, aby mi ukázal, ako strašne predvídateľne jednám ja. aj lov premeníš na mechanicku rutinu. ja &lt;strong>nerobím nič mechanicky&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>dobrý lovec pozná zvyky svojej koristi. preto je dobrým lovcom&lt;/strong> (ak nevieš pri partičke pokru po chvíľke, kto bude ošklbaný, budeš to ty).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>lovec nemá žiadnu rutinu. nie je ako zvieratá, ktoré loví. je slobodný, neuchopiteľný, nepredvídateľný.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>niektoré zvieratá nejde vystopovať. preto sú vzácne. nemajú žiadnu rutinu. preto sú kúzelné.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>priemerný človek sa bojí a preto sa stane korisťou. preto mu zostávajú dve možnosti. ujsť alebo si pripraviť zbraň a postaviť sa k súboju. keď v divočine stopuje lovec, nikdy nevstúpi na miesto, bez toho aby si uvedomoval, aké sú jeho ochranné body.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="9---posledná-bitka-na-zemi">9 - Posledná bitka na zemi&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lovec musí žiť ako lovec, aby mal zo života čo najviac.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dobrý lovec mení svoje spôsoby tak často, ako potrebuje.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čím si tvrdohlavejší, tým lepšie to bude, až sa ti nakoniec podari zmeniť.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>všetci sme hlupáci, ani ja nie som výnimkou.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>máš pocit, že si dôležitý, že je tvojou povinnosťou vysvetľovať, čo robíš, ako by si bol jediný na svete, kto chybuje. neprijímaš zodpovednosť za svoje činy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>záleží na každom čine, lebo sme v tomto tajuplnom svete len chvíľku a ta je moc krátka na to aby sme mohli poznať všetky jeho divy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>myslíš si, že más dosť času, že život bude trvať vecne. &lt;strong>všetko, čo robíš, musí byť tvoj posledný skutok na zemi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>šťastní ľudia jednajú s plným vedomím, že nemajú čas a preto ich činy majú zvláštnu silu. majú silu, pokiaľ ten čo jedna vie, že tieto činy sú jeho poslednou bitkou. Ináč cely tvoj život budu iba činy bázlivého a opatrného človeka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>smrť tohto králika je darom, rovnako ako jedného dna bude tvoja smrť darom pre niekoho iného. (Butler: v každom zvierati je Kristus, ktorý pre nás zomiera).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="10---byť-prístupný-sile">10 - Byť prístupný sile&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>rozdiel medzi bojovníkom a lovcom je, že bojovník je na ceste k sile zatiaľ čo lovec o nej vie veľmi málo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník je lovec, ktorý nemá chybu, lovec, ktorý lovi silu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>pri snívaní máš silu.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mäso (strava) je prestúpené silou.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pre neho bolo zjavne hračkou zostávať v absolútnej nehybnosti celé hodiny.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nemeniť jedálne návyky príliš drasticky.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sila (Shakti) - z počiatku neuveriteľná a strašne vzdialená záležitosť, že je ťažké o nej aj premýšľať. niečo neovládateľného, čo prichádza k človeku. spôsobuje zázraky priamo pred očami. a konečne sila je niečo v človeku, niečo, čo ovláda tvoje činy a predsa poslúchne tvoje rozkazy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>snenie - život, Lílá, teda jej sen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>stav pre &amp;ldquo;zastavenie sveta&amp;rdquo; - spojuje bázeň, moc, silu a smrť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="11---bojovníkové-rozpoloženie">11 - Bojovníkové rozpoloženie&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>usilovať o dokonalosť ducha bojovníka je jedinou úlohou hodnou nášho ľudstva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>predstava, že si vydaný na milosť a nemilosť je neprístupná. nikto nikomu na svete neubližuje, tobôž nie bojovníkovi. preber zodpovednosť (buď ti je po vôli to, čo sa s tebou deje, alebo s tým niečo rob).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>podrobnosti ani živosť snov nie sú dôležité.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vidieť svoje ruky = snívať.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ovládať svoje sny.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mal si primeranú mieru sebaovládania a primeranú mieru odovzdania sa. dokážeš prekonať sám seba, ak si v patričnom rozpoložení. bojovník si ten stav vytvára sám. jednať v takom stave je veľmi výhodne. odhodíš v ňom všetky hovadiny a zostaneš prečistený.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>človek potrebuje rozpoloženie bojovníka pre všetko, čo robí, ináč sa pokriví a oškaredie. potom kňučíš, že ťa nútia všetci tancovať, ako pískajú, že si list vo vetre. v takom živote nie je sila.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník je lovcom, berie všetko v úvahu. to je ovládanie. ale len čo sú úvahy u konca, jedná. to je odovzdanie sa. bojovník nie je listom vo vetre, nikto s nim nepohne, aby robil niečo proti sebe alebo proti svojmu najlepšiemu úsudku.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>bojovník môže byt zranený, ale nikdy urazený. nie je preňho nič urážlivého v činoch jeho blížnych, teda pokiaľ je v zodpovedajúcom rozpoložení.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="12---bitka-sily">12 - Bitka sily&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>neponechať nič na náhode, všetko sa počíta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ak ide o lov sily, nemôžeš mať žiaden konkrétny plán. lovec lovi to, čo sa mu ukáže - musí byt stále v pohotovosti.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sila je pocit, ktorý ma človek z určitých veci. je osobná záležitosť. nemôžeš ju pripútať ani presne povedať, čo je.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ja som tak mladý, ako chcem byť. ak si ukladáš osobnú silu, telo dokáže neuveriteľne kúsky. ak ju premrháš, bude z teba za chvíľu tlstý starec.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kto loví silu, pozoruje všetko a všetko mu predáva nejaké tajomstvo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>si človek a máš nebezpečné a záludne sklony - trváš na tom, aby sa ti všetko vysvetľovalo k tvojej plnej spokojnosti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>nemôžeš odísť bez poďakovania. bojovník sa neobracia chrbtom sile, bez toho, aby sa poďakoval za dobro, ktoré sa mu dostalo.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>naučiť svojho ducha kľudne a nezúčastnené prihliadať.&lt;/strong> nič z toho, čo robím, nesmie prezradzovať, čo cítim. miesta sily majú schopnosť vysávať rozrušených ľudí.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="13---posledné-stanovisko-bojovníka">13 - Posledné stanovisko bojovníka&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>musíš byť nekonečne opatrný. keď človek zachádza s silou, musí byť dokonalý. tuto bývajú omyly smrteľne.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>musíš sa starať o toto miesto a toto miesto sa postará o teba. &lt;strong>cela táto zem (ktorú vidíš) je tvoja.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>každý rys si ulož do pamäti. toto je miesto, kde budeš ukladať svoje zdroje a rezervy. budeš tu prichádzať v snení. tu ti budu odhalené tajomstva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>snívať - mentálna aktivita počas bdenia, fantázia.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čo človek prežíva s snením, by sa malo zhodovať s dennou dobou, kedy sníva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>miesto, ktoré si obľúbil. tam zomrieš, bez ohľadu na to, kde budeš. bude to miesto presýtené nezabudnuteľnými spomienkami, miesto zázrakov, odhalenia tajomstva, miesto, kde si si uložil silu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník ma povinnosť sa vracať na miesto, ktoré si obľúbil, vždy, keď narazí na silu, aby si ju tam uložil. chodiť tam môže tak, že príde alebo, že sníva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finálna rekapitulácia: tam bojovník zatancuje svoj posledný tanec. umieranie je veľkolepá, monumentálna záležitosť. tu budeš vyprávať o bitkách, čo si vyhral, prehral, o radostiach a ochromeniach. o zázrakoch, ktoré si nazbieral. smrť tu bude sedieť a pozorovať ťa. a keď dôjdeš na koniec svojho tanca, ukáže smrť na juh.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="14---chôdza-sily">14 - Chôdza sily&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>osobná sila je pocit. niečo, ako keď si šťastný. môžeš to nazývať rozpoloženie.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>loviť silu sa nedá dopredu nijak plánovať. a presne to je na tom to vzrušujúce.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(telo, sila a mladosť). &lt;strong>zachádzam so sebou dobre a preto nemám dôvod sa cítiť unavený či nesvoj. tajomstvo nie je v tom, čo robím, ale skôr v tom, čo nerobím.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čo by som mal robiť, don Juan? Nič, pokračuj ako doteraz. Sila ti nájde cestu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník sa vždy dobre uistí, že všetko je v riadnom stave - súčasť bezchybného jednania.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník jedna, ako by vedel, čo robí, aj keď v skutočnosti nevie nič.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník jedna bezchybne, keď dôveruje svojej osobnej sile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>silu zbieraš tak, že postupne uzatváraš všetky body, odkiaľ ti odteká.&lt;/strong> to nemusíš robiť zámerne, pretože sila si sama nájde vždy spôsob, ako to spraviť. sila je nepostrehnuteľná, keď sa zbiera a ukladá.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>máš v sebe niečo veľmi jalové. ty mi proste chceš vyhovieť. odjakživa chceš každému vyhovieť, každému sa prispôsobuješ a tým sa samozrejme automaticky staviaš nad všetkých a nad všetko.&lt;/strong> tvoje prispôsobovanie je jalové, zráža ťa k úbohosti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jedinými protivníkmi, ktorí sú nám rovní, sú naši blízki.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vždy, keď si za mnou prišiel, sa tvoje &lt;strong>telo&lt;/strong> naučilo isté veci, aj proti tvojej vôli.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;nedelat, co umím delat&amp;rdquo; je kľúčom k sile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>prvým cieľavedomým krokom, ako zbierať a ukladať osobnú silu, je dovoliť telu, aby &amp;ldquo;nedelalo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> (meditácia).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="15---nedeláni">15 - Nedeláni&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>unavuje ma, že sa stále považuješ za nekonečne dôležitú bytosť, ktorej je treba stále znovu a znovu dokazovať, že svet je neznámy a zázračný.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>neľutuj nič, čo si kedy robil, lebo &lt;strong>keď hodnotíš skutky napr. na zlé a dobré, prikladáš svojmu ja neopodstatnenú dôležitosť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>buď dosiahneme, že je nám mizerne, alebo zo seba spravíme silného človeka. množstvo práce, čo nás to stoji, je rovnaké.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>deláni je to, čo robí tebe tebou a mňa mnou (čo robí niečo niečím - priradenie nama-rupa). keď sa na niečo dívaš, je to delani a keď niečo vidíš, je to nedelani. &lt;strong>bez určitého deláni by v našom okolí nebolo nič známeho.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>delani by znamenalo, nechať ten kamienok niekde povaľovať, pretože je malý kamienok. nedelani znamená zachádzať s kamienkom tak, akoby bol mnohom viac než obyčejný kameň.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>priemernému človeku záleží na tom, či je niečo pravda, alebo nie, ale bojovníkovi nie. ak je niečo pravda, priemerný človek jedná a verí tomu, čo robí. &lt;strong>bojovník jedná v oboch prípadoch. ak je niečo pravdivé, robí to kvôli &amp;ldquo;delani&amp;rdquo;. ak je niečo vyhlásené za nepravdivé, bude stále jednať, tentokrát kvôli &amp;ldquo;nedelani&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>najťažšia časť z bojovníkovej cesty je uvedomenie, že &lt;strong>svet je pocit.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nedelani je veľmi jednoduché, ale ťažké. nejde o to tomu rozumieť, ale o to to zvládnuť. konečným cieľom človeka oddaného poznaniu je vidieť, a videnie dosiahne iba vtedy, keď zastaví svet pomocou techniky nedelani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď človek niečo robí s ľuďmi, mal by sa starať iba o to, aby vec predložil ich telu. nezáleží, či rozumejú, či nie.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>aby bol človek v bezchybnej forme, potrebuje jedno a to zaoberať sa nedelanim.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tiene sú ako dvere k nedelani (tieň je, aj nie je).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>na poznanie najvnútornejších pocitov druhých treba pozorovať ich tieň.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>zväčšiť svet, tak, že ho zredukuješ: zameraj sa na detail, dostane nevídanú ostrosť a detaily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>musíš nechať svoje telo, aby objavilo pocit sily a nedelani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>myslieť si o sebe niečo, či presný opak, je delani&lt;/strong> (pekný/škaredý). &lt;strong>pripútať sa k hocijakému takému delani je strata času. Prísť k skutočnej bytosti v tebe, je nedeláni ja.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>nedelani je vec tela.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tvoje lovisko je v tomto svete (ukázal na rušnú ulicu). delaniu sveta nie je možne uniknúť a tak bojovník premení tento svet na svoje lovisko. bojovník vie, že svet je tu, aby bol užívaný a tak ho využíva do posledného kúsku.&lt;/strong> bojovník je ako ten pirát, ktorý si bez škrupuli zoberie všetko a používa to, s tým rozdielom, že &lt;strong>nemá námietky, ak niekto iný vezme jeho a nemá pocit, že by sa mu ubližovalo, ak je sam používaný.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>na tej oslave si bol ako šašo, nie preto, že by to bolo slúžilo tvojmu účelu, ale preto, že si sa vydal ľudom napospas. nikdy si nič neovládal a preto si musel utiecť.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Bojovník je stále bdelý, aby sa ho chopil. Žiješ tak, že nenechávaš nič na náhode?&lt;/li>

&lt;li>telo ti povie. &lt;strong>hlava - vysvetlenia, telo pocity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dneska ti kojoti nehovoria nič a nevidíš čary sveta. to všetko si robil proste preto, že sa v tebe čosi zastavilo. od chvíle, kedy sa narodíme, nám stále niekto hovorí, že svet je taký a taký atď., a preto prirodzene nemáme inú možnosť, než vidieť svet, ako nám hovoria.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čarodej, ktorý nevidí, veri, že kojoti hovoria, ale ten, kto vidí vie, že veriť tomu znamená uviaznuť v ríši čarodejov. a podľa rovnakej mieri neveriť, že kojoti rozprávajú, znamená uviaznuť v ríši obyčajných ľudí.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kojotí čarodej - ten, kto mnoho veci čerpá od svojich bratov. ideálny spoločník - zmija.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to skutočne, o čo ide, nastáva, keď si telo uvedomí, že vie vidieť. iba potom môže človek poznať, že svet, na ktorý sa denne dívame, je iba popis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>aby človek videl, musí sa naučiť dívať na svet ináč, a jediný spôsob, ktorý poznám, je svet čarodejov.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>po stretnutí s spojencom už nebolo skutočné nič.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>cesta je skutočná, iba pútnici skutoční nie sú.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>stretneš sa s spojencom, zápasíš a skrotíš ho. potom sa budeš chcieť vydať domov, ale čo si tam zanechal bude navždy stratené. to už budeš čarodej, ale to ti nepomôže. v tú chvíľu je pre nás všetkých dôležité iba to, že sme opustili všetko, čo milujeme alebo nenávidíme alebo si prajeme.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tvoj spojenec roztočí iba teba samotného a uvrhne ťa do neznámych svetov.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď sa roztočíš s svojím spojencom, zmení sa tvoja predstava sveta. a predstava je všetko, čo je. a keď sa zmení, zmení sa sam svet.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Genaro zanechal svoju vášeň v Ixtlane. nechal tam svoj domov, svojich ľudí, všetky veci, o ktoré stál. A teraz sa túla s svojimi citmi a niekedy, ako hovori, možno dorazí do Ixtlanu. nostalgia.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>odišiel som, ale vtáci zostávajú a spievajú. a mal som pocit, že nás všetkách troch zaplavila vlna veľkej bolesti a neopísateľného osamotenia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>človek na ceste poznania prežije, iba ako bojovník, lebo jeho umenie je udržiavať rovnováhu medzi hrôzou, že je človek, a zázrakom, že je človek.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď si niečo vynucuješ, nič nezískaš (nechcem nič, čo mi nie je dané).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ak chceš prežiť, musíš byť jasný ako kryštál a musíš si byť sám sebou absolútne istý.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="prologue">Prologue&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>life of solitude - either through periodic retreats or continuing inner solitude in society - may be the best answer to cries that modern world is inevitably a &amp;ldquo;lonely crowd.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>your lonely quietude may be bothered by demons of lust, vainglory, or melancholy. Your fears and vanities will follow you into solitude.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The essential thing is to be apart from society for some time, physically, mentally, or spiritually.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is the simple joy of doing nothing, appreciating life away from the crowd.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>like Heraclitus in the Temple of Artemis, the Buddha under his Bodhi Tree, or Thoreau at Walden Pond, Nietzsche felt and thought best an most deeply when alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The deep quiet in which I live and grow against the world, and harvest what they cannot take from me by fire or sword.&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>every philosopher, says Nietzsche, is a hermit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not really a Friend [of Solitude] unless you&amp;rsquo;ve either chosen isolation or, if it were thrust upon you, you came to appreciate its therapeutic, creative powers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="the-apologia">The Apologia&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>be still and see that I am God (Psalm 46)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>begin, in this life, to feel the delights of the life eternal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Among the great benefit of books, says Petrarch, is that they do not ask for food or drink and are content with a narrow portion of one&amp;rsquo;s house, yet they provide inestimable treasures of mind. In their authors, on has unfailing companions always prepared to be silent or to speak, to stay at home or to accompany him in the woods, to travel&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>isolation without literature is exile, prison, and torture; but supply literature, and it becomes your country, freedom and delight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Petrarch stresses, however, that &lt;strong>his closest friend in solitude was his own reflective mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>solitude can supply what he calls a &amp;ldquo;divine fertility of intellect&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>he admits that he is still tied to the miseries of the world by two &amp;ldquo;fetters of gold&amp;rdquo;. One is his love of Laura; the other is his desire for fame, as symbolized by the laurel wreath with which he was crowned poet laureate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>earthly success may run counter to his heavenly goals, that he should put virtue before glory&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="lady-solitude">Lady Solitude&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>Solitude is indeed something holy, innocent, incorruptible, and the purest of human possessions. To whom does she reveal herself amid forests, for whom does she display her charms and thorns? &amp;hellip; With whom, finally, does she ingratiate herself, who does she seek to please, except the person who has penetrated the inmost recesses of solitude and for whom therefore there is no solitude?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let the others be constantly in a state of restlessness and agitation, let us establish ourselves with feet firmly planted on the rock.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>a shaman cannot become truly powerful until he is capable of &amp;ldquo;seeing the body as a skeleton&amp;rdquo; - in other words, contemplating the reality of death&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True wisdom is only to be found far away from people, out in the great solitude, and it is not found in play but only through suffering. solitude and suffering open the human mind, and therefore a shaman must seek his wisdom there.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>if one is satisfied with living alone in an empty place, regarding the agents of defilement as bitter enemies, and content with his own company, then he may drink the &amp;ldquo;nectar of spiritual exultation&amp;rdquo; and enjoy &amp;ldquo;happiness greater than that of paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>solitude - as an &amp;ldquo;end in itself&amp;rdquo; and the highest realization of the good life in the polis. &amp;ldquo;for contemplation,&amp;rdquo; says artistotle, is &amp;ldquo;the highest form of activity, since the intellect is the highest thing in us, and the objects that it apprehends are the highest things that can be known.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>after Narcissus died, according to Ovid, he was transformed into a beautiful spring flower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pythagoras &amp;ldquo;sought out not only agreeable seclusion but even vast and frightful wildernesses, and often went on toilsome journeys in deserted regions in his zeal for investigating the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Democritus, was so enamored of solitude that he &amp;ldquo;tore out his eyes in order to see the truth and avoid seeing the mob, which is the enemy of truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Abaris &amp;hellip; lived without food, and traveled all over the world as a wandering missionary like Aristeas bearing a golden arrow, symbol of the god Apollo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the goddess of &amp;ldquo;avenging Justice&amp;rdquo; welcomed him graciously and taught him the marks of true Being, the immortal essence of all things. As important, she taught him the method of correct thinking - that is, logic. The dialogue marks the first appearance of logical argument in Greek philosophy. Using that powerful tool, the goddess explains that Being must be the only entity that exists, because it is the only thing that did not &amp;ldquo;come into being.&amp;rdquo; For if Being came into being in the past or will do so in the future, then &amp;ldquo;it is not.&amp;rdquo; But since Being does exist, says the goddess, it must be &amp;ldquo;unborn and imperishable, whole, unique, immovable, and without end.&amp;rdquo; She even asserted that Being has a shape: &amp;ldquo;It is complete on every side, like the mass of a well-rounded sphere.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one may rise on the wings of Eros through several interrelated stages toward a kind of enlightenment: first, by directing one&amp;rsquo;s love to other bodies; then by transforming that love into a meditation on the &amp;ldquo;beauty in souls&amp;rdquo;; then by turning one&amp;rsquo;s mind to &amp;ldquo;the great ocean of beauty, and in contemplation of it give birth to many beautiful and magnificent speeches and thoughts in the abundance of philosophy.&amp;rdquo; Finally, at the highest level, one may contemplate &amp;ldquo;being by itself always in simplicity.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Therein,&amp;rdquo; said Diotima, &amp;ldquo;is life worth living.&amp;rdquo; For he who comprehends &amp;ldquo;Beauty itself&amp;rdquo; will be &amp;ldquo;the friend of God, and immortal if any man ever is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>both Parmenides and Socrates imply that the way to understanding the transcendent world of Being or the imminent worlds of Truth and Beauty is through a mental journey of some kind.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The objective of moderation and &amp;ldquo;the end of all action,&amp;rdquo; says Democritus, is euthymia, which may be translated as &amp;ldquo;cheerfulness,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;well-being,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;contentment.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; equanimity, tranquillity, and a wise retirement from social turmoil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The man who wishes to have serenity of spirit should not engage in many activities, either private or public, nor choose activities beyond his power and natural capacity. He must guard against this, so that when good fortune strikes him and leads him on to excess by means of (false) seeming, he must rate it low, and not attempt things beyond his powers. A reasonable fullness is better than overfullness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Democritus maintained that contentment will grow as one is satisfied with less&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his emphasis on pleasure was the opposite of self-indulgence or libertinism, for he viewed it not as excess, but as the absence of pain and anxiety.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Withdrawal into obscurity is the best form of security.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Philo&amp;rsquo;s man of virtue does not love solitude out of misanthropy. He is rather a lover of men who spends his time in an out-of-the-way place to avoid the vices of the multitude.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;alone with the Alone&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cut away all that is excessive, straighten all that is crooked, bring light to all that is overcast, labor to make all one glow of beauty and never cease chiseling your statue until there shall shine from it the godlike splendor of virtue, until you shall see the perfect Goodness established in the stainless shrine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to rise through mystic contemplation above the pains and flaws of this world to an ideal world of perfection, where &amp;ldquo;the essential man outgrows Being, becomes identical with the Transcendent Being.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;image to archetype.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is the life of the gods and of godlike and blessed men, - liberation from the alien that besets us here, a life taking no pleasure in the things of earth - a flight of the alone to the Alone.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Stop your thinking, he said. Destroy your concepts. think without &amp;ldquo;thinking.&amp;rdquo; The text reads: Let there be no seeing, no hearing; enfold the spirit in quietude and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure, do not labour your body, do not churn up your essence&amp;hellip; When the eye does not see, the ear does not hear, end the mind does not know, then your spirit will protect the body and the body will enjoy long life.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Do not stay in a state which is in disorder. When the empire possesses the Way, be seen. When the empire does not possess the Way, hide.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t escort the big chariot; You will only make yourself dusty. Don&amp;rsquo;t think about the sorrows of the world; You will only make yourself wretched.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If only my mind can be beautiful, it matters nothing that I often faint for famine.&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep your soul from confusion, and it will come naturally,&amp;quot; says Wang: Await in emptiness, before even inaction. All other things proceed from this&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;It is ever so that the essence of things is what gives them life.&amp;rdquo; That essence - the Tao - is silent, compact, and obscure, which no fixed place. The supreme quality for men, therefore is also quiescence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If quiescent, you will then obtain it. If hasty, you will then lose it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A noble person with sufficient inner virtue may give the appearance of a fool. Therefore, give up your high-handed manner, your desires, your vanity, and your zeal - for they are no use to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;When you have little, you&amp;rsquo;ll attain much,&amp;rdquo; he wrote. &amp;ldquo;With much, you&amp;rsquo;ll be confused.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The secret lies with understanding - or, more precisely, feeling, absorbing, and living in &amp;ldquo;the true essence of things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tales that do not over-explain but rather point the way to freedom, happiness, and perfection in unexpected quarters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first step, she explains, is to put the world outside of your-self&amp;hellip; then to put things outside of yourself&amp;hellip; then to put life outside of yourself, at which point you will be able to achieve the &amp;ldquo;brightness of dawn&amp;rdquo; and to &amp;ldquo;see your aloneness.&amp;rdquo; At that point, she says, one can &amp;ldquo;do away with past and present&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;enter a place where there is no life or death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>not only to withdraw for a time from society but literally to isolate oneself from oneself - from all the excess baggage of one&amp;rsquo;s painful memories, rigid habits, and learned feelings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;You have too many policies and plans and you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen what is needed&amp;hellip; You are still making mind your teacher.&amp;rdquo; Instead, you must fast!&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listening stops with the ears, the mind stops with recognition, but the spirit is empty and waits on all things. The way gathers in emptiness alone&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the ancient Chinese hermits advocates a kind of worldly mysticism&amp;hellip; they were somehow less ashamed of the body and more optimistic about prospects of being happy in the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>be more like Emperor Yao, who neither possessed men nor allowed himself to be possessed by them.&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;So I ask you,&amp;rdquo; says the Master, &amp;ldquo;to rid yourself of hardship, to cast off your cares, and to wander alone with the Way to the Land of Great Silence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Any trial whatever that comes to you can be conquered by silence.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>My Rule is to receive you with hospitality and to let you go in peace&amp;quot;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you cannot attain stillness where you now live, consider living in exile&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The proof of having achieved a state of apatheia will come, says Evagrius, &amp;ldquo;when the spirit begins to see its own light, when it remains in a state of tranquility in the presence of images it has during sleep and when it maintains its calm as it beholds the affairs of life&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;You too must reach the point where you no longer take offence at anything&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;There are not many outstanding experts in worldly philosophy,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;But I would claim that rarer still are those who are truly expert in the philosphy of stillness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="sufi-soloist">Sufi Soloist&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do you ever fear solitude? If you had tasted the delight of solitude, you would long for it, away from your self. Solitude is the beginning of the worship of God. What is the first thing you find in solitude? Peace far away from human intercourse and safety far from the evils which accompany it. When may the servant taste the bliss of intimacy with God? When his love for God becomes pure and he communes with him with a sincere heart. When is his love pure? When all his desires are concentrated in one: to obey God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;If you are capable of erecting an iron wall between yourself and your desires, then do it&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;the people are the wild beasts of God on the earth. They show no affection for any human being.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>serving God through asceticism - that is like breathing vinegar and mustard. Possessing divine knowledge - that is like scent of musk and ambergris.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;he renounced everything save God.&amp;rdquo; Thereafter, his true self was at one with the Infinite, so he had nothing more to either renounce or desire.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>drinking of wine as a symbol of the joyful ecstasy of divine union&amp;hellip; The cup of unending joy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you get by wanting is only as big as your capacity to desire. Give you desire therefore, think that whatever you get is what you want, and in this acceptance find ease and joy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Renounce desire a hundred times or else not once will you embrace your desire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The wine we really drink is our own blood. Our bodies ferment in these barrels. We give everything for a glass of this. We give our minds for a sip.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Externally he is congenial with everyone. Inwardly, he is a stranger to all. He is at peace with all people, yet within himself tranquillity is to be found only in Divine Love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Die, and be quiet. &lt;strong>Quietness is the surest sign that you&amp;rsquo;ve died. Your old life was a frantic running from silence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The phenomenal is the Bridge to the Real,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one must rise above all things worldly, including asceticism and preprogrammed concepts of Heaven. It only stands to reason, therefore, that no images are inherently bad; any of them may provide concrete material to build a joyful spiritual bridge or tools to break out of the prison of ordinary life.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Be still. How? The author recommends focusing the mind on a single word, such as &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;God.&amp;rdquo; And, he says, &amp;ldquo;If your mind continues to intellectualize over the meaning and connotations of this little word, remind yourself that its value lies in its simplicity.

&lt;li>Sorry the man, to my mind, who has not in his own home a place to be all by himself, to pay his court privately to himself, to hide!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>all of man&amp;rsquo;s unhappiness derives from one thing, which is not knowing how to rest quietly in a room.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>he was frequently &amp;ldquo;the happiest of men&amp;rdquo; when alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The sentiment of existence, stripped of another emotion, is in itself a precious sentiment of contentment and of peace which alone would suffice to make this existence dear and sweet to anyone able to spurn all the sensual and earthly impressions which incessantly come to distract us from it and to trouble its sweetness here-below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from the society.&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;I am at home in MYSELF, I speak my own language, &lt;strong>I hate extraordinary things,&amp;rdquo; says Teste. &amp;ldquo;Only weak minds need them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Quaker meetings, which begin in silence and remain so until any one of the attendees is moved to speak.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rather than believing that religious contemplation might help to foster spiritual life, the Protestant, says Weber, places greater emphasis on a belief that selfless, worldly industry is the way to achieve God&amp;rsquo;s grace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the religious valuation of restless, continuous, systematic work became &amp;ldquo;the surest and most evident proof of rebirth and genuine faith.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the ascetic discipline of the monk and the hermit - the self-denial, the submission to authority, the dedicated industriousness for a greater good - was transformed into the worldly asceticism that is now the foundation of that most successful of modern institutions: the corporation.

&lt;li>True solitude is found in humility, which is infinitely rich. False solitude is the refuge of pride, and it is indefinitely poor.

&lt;li>soon-to-be-world-historical figure withdraws into solitude at a certain troubled time in his life, and at a crucial turning point in the development, more commonly the disintegration, of his civilization. Alone, he rethinks the predicaments in which he finds himself.

&lt;li>only someone who is ready for anything, doesn&amp;rsquo;t exclude any experience, even the most incomprehensible, will live the relationship with another person as something alive and will himself sound the depths of his own being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hermits make the best lovers, in both the spiritual and physical senses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Much of that time would be better spent going for a walk, admiring landscape, digging our gardens, or on &amp;ldquo;science and art; not to impress somebody, but for love of beauty that each discloses.&amp;rdquo; We could even be quit occasionally, he adds: Better than such discourse doth silence &lt;strong>long, long barren silence square with my desire.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>only through complete isolation and dedication to the infinite do we have any hope of achieving enlightenment. All other solitudes, says Merton, are false.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>asceticism is as much the lot of men tied to jobs and mortgage payments as it is the practice of religious hermits&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for philosophers, scholars, and sundry free spirits, self-deprivation and even lust for glory are justified because they constitute a &amp;ldquo;preparation of the intellect for its future &amp;lsquo;objectivity.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wisdom, proclaims Nietzche&amp;rsquo;s Zarathustra, is a woman: &amp;ldquo;She always loves only a warrior.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>It was out in the Great Solitude that the first Iglulik shaman discovered shamanism and he later dove physically into the ground to discover the secrets of hunting. After days of fasting in solitude, the young Ojibwa initiate discovered the secrets of how to grow corn and thereby save his tribe. Buddha achieved enlightenment only after many years in ascetic solitude, when he looked like a skeleton with skin. And Saint John of the Cross made a point of saying that it was the &amp;ldquo;Dark Night&amp;rdquo; of his suffering in solitude that led to his unfathomable nearness with God.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="judgment-versus-faith">Judgment versus Faith&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>true faith required selfless, meditative prayer and stern discipline&amp;hellip; those who are not willing to work at it patiently will finally end in compromise. Here, as elsewhere, compromise is only another name for failure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we are to be truly happy and fulfilled, to understand the rhyme and reason for All, or enter the tavern of ruin, then stronger medicine, more perseverance, and a jarring life experience may be required. These may be necessary if we are to renounce worldly desires and embrace sufferings - thereby to rise above both to another plane.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>often soul-wrenching - time spent alone can produce some of the most extraordinary riches.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secluded meditation guards him who meditates, lengthens his life, gives him strength, and shuts out faults; it removes ill-fame, and leads to good repute, it drives out discontent, and makes for contentment, it removes fear and gives confidence, it removes sloth and gives vigor, it removes greed, hate, and delusion; it slays pride, breaks up preoccupations, makes thought one-pointed, softens the mind, generates gladness, makes one venerable, gives rise to much profit, makes one worthy of homage, brings exuberant joy, causes delight, shows the own-being of all conditioned things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>what Patanjali emphasizes is the highest attainment of the yogi, who should finally renounce the siddhis and rise to the &amp;ldquo;infinite knowledge&amp;rdquo; and final liberation of the Self, which he calls the &amp;ldquo;Rain-Cloud of Divinity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>solitude may be creative by providing a mental environment that helps to produce something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t there before.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="search-for-consistencies">Search for Consistencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the fruits of solitude are remarkably consistent across time and culture, there is little consistency in the outward circumstances of the Friends&amp;rsquo; eremitism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Simplicity of life - and, at higher strength, poverty and asceticism - seem naturally to be associated with the life of solitude.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diogenes Laertius, he was once spotted laughing to himself in a lonely spot. When asked why he took such pleasure when alone, he uttered this famous reply: &amp;ldquo;That is just the reason!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bitterness of mind should be &amp;ldquo;avoided like a plague.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>education seems to have provided a discipline of thought that enabled them to get busy with creative output in time alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consciousness has never functioned in the manner of a conventional computer, which allows some processing to go on entirely separately from all other processing in the same machine. Instead, we are constantly distracted by the social noise of daily affairs, along with the internal residue of society in the form of memories, regrets, desires, and habits.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="creativity">Creativity&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The righteous man,&amp;rdquo; says the Sufi al-Arusi, &amp;ldquo;is changed forty times a day, but the hypocrite remains in the same state for forty years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="reverie">Reverie&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Solitude leads the mind to those sources from whence the grandest conceptions are most likely to flow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;for by reason of the disturbance caused by this affair of the world he cannot see his sins, but if he lives in the peace and quietness of the desert he is able to see God clearly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By &amp;ldquo;fasting,&amp;rdquo; he does not mean simply a restriction of diet, nor merely intense concentration alone. He advocates, rather, a complete emptying of the normal self, with its excess baggage of fears and habitual beliefs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>world&amp;rsquo;s greatest, most creative thinkers - he mentions recent ones, from Descartes to Wittgenstein - lived alone for most of their lives. Storr reasons that creation begins, in its first stage, with preparation, during which the creative person develops an interest in a particular subject, collects material, reads everything he can on the subject. Over time the accumulated material simmers in the mind. &amp;ldquo;We do not understand what goes on during this period of incubation,&amp;rdquo; Storr admits, &amp;ldquo;but it is a necessary prelude to the next stage, that of illumination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dreams have an information-processing function, which is concerned with allotting new experiences to the right slot in permanent memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In such a solitary, daydreaming state, the prepared mind, with its mysterious sorting process, may be better equipped for performing the essential and difficult creative task of &amp;ldquo;forming new links between formerly disparate entities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The best way to arrive at this state is through walking, forgetting, and a &amp;ldquo;cheerful imagination.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Movement which does not come from outside then occurs inside us&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="passion">Passion&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nietzsche states explicitly that by avoiding the distracting effects of both physical and social intercourse, inner resources of passion can be used to boost intellectual powers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;the &amp;lsquo;higher phallus,&amp;rsquo; with the head as the seat of creative realization.&amp;rdquo; Neumann explains that as consciousness develops in individuals it takes its impetus from innate animal instinct. That instinct, or libido, is required to make the ego strong enough to break away from the collective unconsciousness - that is, the collective transpersonal archetypes of the world, or what Neumann terms the &amp;ldquo;Earth Mother.&amp;rdquo; As the conscious ego develops sufficient autonomy, it then has a desire to use the same libidinal energy to reenter the mysterious Earth Mother. The result is enrichment of both consciousness and libido.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="inner-resources">Inner Resources&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The obvious problem with the source of creative energy is that human passions are very difficult to control&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;capacity to be alone&amp;rdquo; is something developed early in life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It also helps if one has something to be passionate about - a problem to be solved, discovery to be made, or a project to be completed - which will, in effect, distract one&amp;rsquo;s attention from the distractions of society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;if you are idle, be not solitary; if you are solitary, be not idle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="altered-states">Altered States&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sometimes the best thing is to set aside the burden of concentration and go for a walk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An occasional return to society can easy the sense of loneliness and balance the mind, and nearly all of the Friends who we associate with extreme solitude made such forays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shamanic states, in other words, may make possible in preliterate culture a form of thinking that employs intuitive abstraction without making use of the rational abstractions available to modern thinkers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="voices">Voices&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is an effort to strike out beyond the limits of intelligence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perhaps he is right not to attempt explanation, for that would be to murder the mysterious wit, which is the soul of all creativity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="joy">Joy&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;To shun familiarity with others, as if they were a thorn in the flesh, shows a sound judgement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoreau said that &lt;strong>more than being a writer of books, he wanted to make his life a work of art. Often, he went a step further to advocate appreciating life as a transcendent work of art, in idleness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>strategic moderation. &amp;ldquo;The truest happiness,&amp;rdquo; as the philosopher explains in his Letter to Menoecus, &amp;ldquo;does not come from enjoyment of physical pleasures, but from a simple life, free of anxiety, with the normal physical needs satisfied.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;We must not send our desires upon a distant quest, but we should permit them to have access to what is near, since they do not endure to be shut up altogether.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;cleaner conscience&amp;rdquo; is one of the greatest rewards of the secluded life. &amp;ldquo;In solitude,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;one is removed from the object of the sin, from temptations as well as the influence of wrong-minded men.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the mind is impressionable and has none too firm a hold on what is right, it must be rescued from the crowd: it is so easy for it to go over to the majority.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>there is a sense of well-being and physical and mental control that may be achieved by following a program of strenuous training - which, appropriately enough, is precisely the meaning of the Greek askesis, from which our word asceticism derives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="defence-mechanisms">Defence Mechanisms&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Buddha continues to recommend a balanced asceticism in the form of mendicancy and self control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>according to Freud, the &amp;ldquo;oceanic feeling&amp;rdquo; which the mystic aims to achieve is merely &amp;ldquo;memory of a relatively undifferentiated infantile ego state.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Plotinus likewise plotted the course to that immortal realm through a flight to the Primal Beauty of the Alone. &amp;ldquo;To attain it,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;is for those that will take the upward path,&amp;rdquo; and enter the celebrations of the Mysteries laying aside garments, &amp;ldquo;in the nakedness, until passing on the upward way all that is other than God, each in the solitude of himself shall behold that solitary-dwelling Existence, the Apart, the Unmingled, the Pure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;No soul can rest,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;until it is detached from all creation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>wandering homelessness&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if you have nothing, you have nothing to lose; if you desire nothing you have everything to win.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>there is no hope of achieving a true and lasting happiness in the world as it appears to us viewed through the lens of desire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>suicide is just another form of self-caring and desire. So truly to give up desire, one must give up desire for death, perhaps even desire for enlightenment, along with one&amp;rsquo;s incessant pessimism. As a second step, then, one may think: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Instead of isolating myself from the world, why not just give up the idea that I deserve or might win any further rewards from the world than the mysterious majesty of existence that already presents itself before me? What more do I want?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> At that point, something miraculous seems to happen. For aside from all the philosophy and religious dogma that later come into play and quicken the process, optimism beings to grow, seemingly from nothing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you abandon the affairs of the world, your body will be without toil. If you forget life, your vitality will be unimpaired.&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="selfless-love">Selfless Love&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>It is literally eroticism, he writes, which gives chaste souls the energy or motivation to climb the spiritual ladder to God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;If they ask what Love is&amp;rdquo;, he says, &amp;ldquo;tell them it is the sacrifice of will. For if you have not left your will behind, you have no will at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yes, to become lowly, lowlier still - as lowly as possible. This is the great secret of mystical life. And then, having reduced oneself to a single point and become nothing more than a soul and heart which loves, to get used to a complete reversal of the usual position - the eternal position of pride, and the uneasy position of the ego which always sees itself as the center of the universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="thoughtless-philosophy">Thoughtless Philosophy&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>Only when there is no pondering and no cognition will you get to know the Way. Only when you have no surroundings and follow no practices you will find the rest in the Way. Only when there is no path and no procedure can you get to the Way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to become a true bride of Christ one must not only become lost in a fierce tumult of love; the lonely contemplator must also have &amp;ldquo;lost himself in a Waylessness and in a Darkness, in which all contemplative men wander in fruition and wherein they never again can find themselves in a creaturely way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Youth are initiated into adulthood by &amp;ldquo;killing&amp;rdquo; their youthful ways, by being taken away from the protection of their mothers and families, and by being introduced forcefully to the great but also fearsome world outside the tribe where ancestors and good and evil spirits lurk. As Eliade puts it, the initiate &amp;ldquo;dies&amp;rdquo; to the temporal, profane world and is reborn into the world of the sacred, which is beyond time and the font of the group&amp;rsquo;s culture, spiritual values, and protections. The initiatory death, he says, &amp;ldquo;provides the clean slate on which will be written the successive revelations whose end is the formation of a new man.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the neophyte should now be emancipated from all concepts, pious and impious.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;We do not need philosophy to drive us to work. Necessity will do that,&amp;rdquo; he says. Rather, we need philosophy to &amp;ldquo;kill boredom, to destroy inertia, to dispel lethargy, to drive away weariness, to overcome a sense of futility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We must philosophize with our malice. We must be as gods, selecting and rejecting. To accept the Cosmos in its entirety is the gesture of a slave not of a man.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>his penance, no matter how fervent, will do him little good until he cultivates an understanding of this own Soul, which is also the Soul of the universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Incomprehensible is the supreme Soul, unlimited, unborn, unthinkable - His soul is space itself! In the dissolution of the world, He alone remains awake.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Verily, freedom from desire is like the choicest extract from the choicest treasure. For a person who is made up of all desires, who has the marks of determination, conception, and self conceit, is bound. By being the opposite of that one is liberated.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>contemplation, which is essentially asocial, is a primary end of the zoon politikon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>proliferation of computers that digitize our minds, nine-to-five jobs that so sap our spirit we never have time to come back to ourselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Narcissism, he explains, &amp;ldquo;appears realistically to represent the best way of coping with the tensions and anxieties of modern life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In response, the narcissist may turn to the literature of self-help and what Lash terms &amp;ldquo;the ideology of personal growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-to-be-done">What Is to Be Done?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Hegel&amp;rsquo;s basic point that alienation - in other words, solitude in society - is essential to individual human maturity and dignity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>what matters is to increase men&amp;rsquo;s capacity to cope with alienation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it is only when we intentionally cultivate alienation and actively set the world outside ourselves once in a while that we will have a chance of seeing the world as it is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without alienation from the world, they say, one cannot know God. The worst form of estrangement in society is not one&amp;rsquo;s separation from a warm, well-tempered community - but one&amp;rsquo;s isolation from the transcendent, all-powerful One, which is the only true reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The state of existence is the state of estrangement&amp;hellip; Man as he exists is not what he essentially is and ought to be. He is estranged from his true being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;In moments of solitude,&amp;rdquo; he writes in his essay Loneliness and Society, &amp;ldquo;something is done to us. The center of our being, the innermost self that is the ground of our aloneness, is elevated to the divine center and taken into it. Therein can we rest without losing ourselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="deleting-loneliness">Deleting Loneliness&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I found many warnings that the sense of loneliness will continue to increase with changes in demographics, along with advances in technology and instant global communications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first step is to choose solitude, to find a lonely spot, a place that you can love and where you might escape your tolls, troubles, and distractions. There, you might listen to your timeless self; sort things out; moderate desires, or ponder how best to redirect your life to something important and true, something that will fire your passion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your worst fear, in addition to thoughts of death, is likely to be your fear of separation from the safety and nurturing warmth of society. But that is part of the adventure. Perhaps most important thing to remember is that separation is also freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you lose yourself in waylessness, you may discover something wonderful there. You may not find the happiness you expect, but you may discover something larger that is beyond your expectations and for which, like all art, music, solo journeys of shamans, philosophy, and religion, words can spoil the meaning.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="inner-solitude">Inner Solitude&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it is possible and preferable to be solitary in a positive sense in society - simultaneously and continuously.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>he could evoke a solitude of mind no matter where he was. Even in the city&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mediate not on the ocean or starry heavens but on that which happens to be before me here and now.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>he discovers joy in himself; joined by discipline to the infinite spirit, the self attains inexhaustible joy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhagavadgita advocates not so much saving the joys of time alone for latter half of life, but rather solitude in society, acceptance of fate, and responsibility in the world accompanied by spiritual innerness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>His nature is free of conditions, Win or lose, It makes no difference to him. Alone in the forest or out in the world, A god in heaven or a simple beggar, It makes no difference!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Never seek the solitude of the forest, Nor running from the crowd. Always and everywhere, He is one and the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>The small hermit lives in the mountains. The great hermit lives in a town.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The world is like a bride,&amp;rdquo; says al-Ghazali, &amp;ldquo;He who loves her combs and decorates her hair. The ascetic blackens her face, tears her hair out, and rends her clothes. But he who possesses the knowledge of God is completely absorbed in God and does not worry about her at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Westerners who do see the value and possibility of spiritual solitude in the world tend to be novelists, philosophers, or heretics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If he really has God and only God, then nothing disturbs him&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One must learn an inner solitude, wherever or with whomsoever he may be. He must learn to penetrate things and find God there, to get a strong impression of God firmly fixed in his mind.&lt;/li>
