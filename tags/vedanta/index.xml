&lt;p>Imagine working hard your entire life for perfection. You improve, then push even harder and improve more. Finally, you become the best. There you are—perfect. You know all the rules of the game, and all the tricks, too. Each game is fixed; you know the winner in advance - it&amp;rsquo;s you! The first game, the next, and even the last, you know the results beforehand. And you start to yawn.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CekdQq7x4hE">src&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Glory of India is that has given two epics to the world. Two more are Iliad and Odyssey.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First Vedas, then Ramayana then Mahabharata then came Puranas (mythology).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Vedic religion they worshipped gods in the form of nature forces. E.g. Sun is the god (aditya hrdayam). Moon. Earth. Waters, Fire, Wind. Rain (Indra). Rivers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion that is practices is mostly (99%) based on mythological books - Puranas. Rama is there, not replaced but all Vedic gods are replaced. Nobody worships Indra nowadays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion is based mostly on belief but has a philosophic base. This makes it meaningful. If it is not there, it becomes mechanical and superstition. Without bhakti religion becomes very worldly and does not inspire anybody.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore jnanam and bhakti (upasana) save the religion. Without them the popular religion based on belief becomes entire dogmatic and superstitious.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramayana leans more to the Vedas and less to the puranas. Mahabharata leans more towards puranas and less towards Vedas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tulasi Ramayana&lt;/strong> - a very joyous journey. Top purana, even before Bhagavatam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramayana is considered the very first poem. Adikavyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedas are humankind&amp;rsquo;s original poetry. They are not religious texts. Got converted into religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount of misconceptions people have about Rama and Ramayana is mind blowing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Epic is an poem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ramayana is a love story&lt;/strong>, not a religions text.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are two kinds of love stories. The sentiment (rasa) is either:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>shrungara - there are obstacles in the progress of love between hero and heroin. Obstacles are overcome and the whole thing ends in a comedy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>karuna - pathos, pity is the sentiment. The thing still ends as comedy. This is the sentiment of Ramayana.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Due to Shakespeare people connect sentiment of karuna with tragedy. In Indian literature there are no tragedies. They are tabu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Uttarakanda is not part of the original Ramayana.&lt;/strong> A bad addition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ramayana is a historic story. If an epic is not historic, it becomes a purana&lt;/strong> (mythological story).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The purpose of Ramayana is to glorify Dharma (righteousness) in people&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/strong> People generally have the excuses that nobody else follows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rama&amp;rsquo;s message to the world. Dharma is the soul of life.&lt;/strong> Not artha and kama. Those are needed for social life. Dharma for spiritual. And in Ramayana they are wonderfully united.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rama is also ideal son, ideal brother, ideal king.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bhagavan is not god. Bhagavan means &amp;ldquo;very revered&amp;rdquo;. In Ramayana Rama is not a god, he&amp;rsquo;s a human being.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Avatara idea of a god descending is entirely alien to the Vedas. Avatara word doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in Vedas, in Ramayana neither in Mahabharata (Gita). Neither in Shankarabhasya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The idea of God descending is alien to Shankara&amp;rsquo;s vision. It started to appear in 6th CE and got popular from 11 century CE onwards. &lt;strong>In the Vedic vision god is not above. It is among us, around us and within us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the upanishadic wisdom you&amp;rsquo;re a human being and have two options. There is an animal within you and there is divinity in you. Go downward or uplift yourself and &lt;strong>rise into divinity which is already by you. That is Rama - superhuman. Hanuman are subhuman, humanoid (not animals). Ravanna is anti-human.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Superhuman because he follows dharma unconditionally. Because of his qualities of head and heart. Rama as most ideal human being, having here and there some weakness also. Now you need not justify an error, because he&amp;rsquo;s a human being. To err is human.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Necklace is for the neck which stands for the heart. Necklace is the chain of questions and answers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="q-what-should-i-hold-on-to-a-guru-vachanam-message">Q: What should I hold on to? A: guru vachanam (message).&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you hold on to the message, the person of the guru drops. Freedom and psychological dependence don&amp;rsquo;t go together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Most bellowed brother of Rama is Bharata, not so much Lakshmana. Lakshmana thinking-less psychological dependence connected with psychical presence.&lt;/strong> There are sishyas like Bharata, who &lt;strong>take the message, go and implement it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a wonderful teacher and student come together there is born a great wisdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Outer teacher is a milestone. It tells you where to go. The ultimate teacher is the inner self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guru is like a milestone. If you go and embrace the milestone you&amp;rsquo;ll stay with the milestone and never reach the goal&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your inner teacher is guru vachanam.&lt;/strong> It is born out of guru vachanam. It is your inner self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The outer guru will not walk with you. Guru vachanam will.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma is that which sees all this (waking state; sakshi) and which sees nothing (sleep state).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once a wrong thing is put in place, it will spread.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your hope is your inner guru.&lt;/strong> Find that inner goal. Take outer&amp;rsquo;s guru help and go within and cling to the inner guru and you&amp;rsquo;ll be saved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you give importance to the outer guru the inner guru is not even recognised.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="q-what-is-it-that-should-be-given-up-a-akaryam-wrong-act">Q: What is it, that should be given up? A: akaryam (wrong act)&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Talking wrong about another person (gossip). Even if the thing is correct, give it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>See more good in the other person that the other person herself.&lt;/strong> The person will be surprised.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try and it becomes natural too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Just like rise about attachment rise about aversion also.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love mahatma, love the other, love yourself also. Don&amp;rsquo;t be a posture of altruism. The point is, you love all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You change the guru all the time! In fact everybody is a guru. Even a blade of grass is a guru if you&amp;rsquo;re in learning mode.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The guru should know. The guru should not be an idealog. He&amp;rsquo;s got an idea and all the sishya has to subscribe to that idea. &lt;strong>Guru is the one who knows the truth and has no ideology.&lt;/strong> Why should he share? Because he loves people.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is advaita? Do you want a definition so you need not to think?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Better approach? What is not&lt;/strong> advaita. &lt;strong>You discover what it is. You&amp;rsquo;re supposed to think.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advaita is not a vada = intellectual gymnastics. Great scholarship and ability to speak well. Vada is a product of intellect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advaita is not religion. Religion is a belief.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thinking and belief don&amp;rsquo;t go together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beliefs get inherited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion divides people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advaita is a vision, darsanam. &lt;strong>Call it darsanam rather than jnanam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you experience in your heart is advaita. Not what you believe/speculate in your head.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Oneness. &lt;strong>There are not two flowers outside. There is one flower and one flower. Flowers/apples do not add.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multiplicity and reality that we experience in the world. Is it real? One is real. You&amp;rsquo;re real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you can know about God in positive way is only none-sense. That god is an old guy in the cloud? The way to God is negative.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negative understanding is the right understanding in philosophy. We&amp;rsquo;re not in a personality development class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What remains as the residuum after dismissing all superimpositions, the nama-rupas, which are product of the human intellect. That means when the entire operation of the mind and intellect is put aside, what remains - the pure awareness absolute - that is the atma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brahman is immanent. If you stop there it becomes religion. At the same time it is transcendental - the prapancha doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist at all.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vivekananda: every soul is potentially divine. &lt;strong>The goal is to manifest this divinity within&lt;/strong> by work, by worship etc. This is the true religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignorant mind wants to believe rather than think.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rituals are shaped by the desires and fears of the weak human mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Book, temples, forms are but secondary takes. Primary goal of human existence is to discover the divinity within.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no myself and there is no yourself. There is one self of the all.&lt;/strong> There is no friend, there is no foe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What god/religion is not, you have to understand. What is true religion? That&amp;rsquo;s not the point. Supposed I tell you what it is you become my follower. And we&amp;rsquo;ll be following a system. That will be just imitation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not even a swami. Do you have any doubt about &amp;ldquo;aham brahman asmi&amp;rdquo;? That&amp;rsquo;s your problem?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be still and know that you&amp;rsquo;re god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I&amp;rsquo;m Swami TV how can I be brahma as Swami TV? Fact is you all can consider me Swami TV but I&amp;rsquo;m not Swami TV. I know better than that!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>World experience is no different from a movie experience. So &lt;strong>what is there to find about the world? You want to find out what kind of snake it is?&lt;/strong> If it is not a serpent you need not find out what kind of serpent it is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The god that you&amp;rsquo;ll find is a conceptual god. A god that is conceived by the human mind. And the mind shapes its god according to its desires, fears and other idiosyncrasies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Godhead has constricted itself in you as the inner most reality. If you cannot see it you&amp;rsquo;re doing an injustice to yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rise above all the divisions and be the advaya atma.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the vision of Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyDI9qIG7DQ">src&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Buddha was a upanishadah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Buddha&amp;rsquo;s fear: people will go after speculative religious practices by giving up the search for the truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami Vivekananda: Buddha was a great vedantist. Shankara was a hidden buddhist. Swami TV: Buddha is an open buddhist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Buddha dismissed cast and gender distinctions. All are human being. That was most unpalatable for the orthodox ritualists&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you hate something, you invent (folklore) stories&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Human society wants a villain. Unless there is a villain there is no target they can put all their vehemence against.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The orthodox made Buddha a villain because he didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with the violence (against the animals) of the karmakhanda. And then they made stories.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prakrta is the language of the people. Sanskrta is the language of the elite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara wrote his bhasyas in the language of the people, which was at his time Sansrkt. Pali was the prakrta in the time of Buddha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddha is different from Bauddhas. Bauddhas have understood Buddha in their own way. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything clearly about the transcendental. Buddhism is different from Buddha&amp;rsquo;s teachings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dhamma Pada is a book of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jesus Christ was not a religionist. He did not create a religion. He was a philosopher and advaita vedantin.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Indian Society is not a law abiding civilization, but a dharma abiding civilization. Europe and US is a law abiding civilization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vivekananda: &lt;strong>Study Gita-Krishna, don&amp;rsquo;t bother about Radha-Krishna&lt;/strong> (Krishna from stories).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Life is relationships&lt;/strong>. Even for sanyasis, there is always a relationship - my students, my teacher, my vedanta, my class, my sampradaya &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The value of the thing is not intrinsic. It comes from the mind. Because the mind believes it&amp;rsquo;s valuable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When physical things become very important in your live, you&amp;rsquo;ll miss the truth and relationships with other people will get disturbed.&lt;/strong> Therefore the mind has more importance as the physical things. And one meaning of dharma is &amp;ldquo;physical thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

He explains that while both dreams and waking experiences are not true, the experiencer (the consciousness) is always there. He states that neither the dream nor the experience is the truth, but rather the experiencer is the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>That is not true. Dream is not true. But did you experience it? So you the experiencer was there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is also not true. But are you experiencing it? That you cannot deny. You the experiencer are there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Neither this is true nor that is true but you&amp;rsquo;re the truth. You means consciousness, not the body/mind.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="40httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvotplffyhppy---verse-10">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTplfFYhppY">40&lt;/a> - Verse 10&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>4 ways of spirituality: karma, bhakti, yoga, jnana. Temple provides facility for all of these. People do all four. Nothing happens, because the mind is compulsive - hyperactive. Karma becomes mechanical, jnana becomes ideation, bhakti becomes a show - you&amp;rsquo;ll need outer symbols of love. Yoga - should be conscious, lose the eyes, be aware of every single movement the body is doing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to feel brahman? You feel full and happy for no reason. There is no sense of dissatisfaction whatsoever.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pleasurability is in the excited form of mind. Happiness is in the form of shanti, quietude. That is the brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re the brahman, why can&amp;rsquo;t you feel it? Because the mind is making too much noise. Like when there are too many clouds on a shiny day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re unable to stop thinking. Thought has become compulsive. People suffer because of compulsive thinking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly it becomes very destructive.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is not kali-yuga. This is pill-yuga. Because people are anxious and don&amp;rsquo;t have patience. Don&amp;rsquo;t start with pills. Start with jogging or a trainer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind throws an opaque screen of labels and images on the vision&lt;/strong>, bhavana, love.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind wants to bite into a problem. Like a dog needs a bone to bite into.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Most of the problems are imagined only. They are very subjective.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ego (me and mine) is located in the brain, not knee, belly etc. Feel it there. Therefore leave the head alone and begin with the heart. Abide there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sa:stha -&amp;gt; en:stay&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind should identify with its source &amp;ldquo;sva&amp;rdquo; - atma. Not with the outer. So it develop the quietude and merges in its source and abides in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In karmayoga the mind totally gets absorbed in the work you&amp;rsquo;re doing. It&amp;rsquo;s called karmasamadhi. That&amp;rsquo;s what you need, not karma per se.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In bhakti (sharanagati) the me, the mind, surrenders completely and there is communion with god in the heart. In bhakti you do not know why you love God.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One becomes unconscious of things. No mind. No mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No care even for one own&amp;rsquo;s body. No me. You become indifferent (not careless).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love with understanding is bhakti. Understanding with love is jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever you think with the mind is not Ishvara. Mind resolved in the heart, that is Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakta, karma, yoga, jnanam are not four things. But an unified vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="41httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcot9bb_uetq---verse-11">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coT9bB_UEtQ">41&lt;/a> - Verse 11&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Once the mind becomes calm it resolves in the being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need a mechanism to calm down the mind. That mechanism is the prana. Because it&amp;rsquo;s between the matter (gross) and the mind (subtle), it&amp;rsquo;s an escape mechanism from the bondage.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>hold the breath for 30-35 secs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parallel to buddhist vipassana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smile is the silent message of bhagavan Buddha. It is your birthright, it is love, it is freedom. Nobody can takeaway your smile.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="42httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvgofx8rvhpc---verse-12">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgofx8rVHpc">42&lt;/a> - Verse 12&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not about God, it&amp;rsquo;s about you. You&amp;rsquo;ve got kriya shakti (the power of doing, vitalforce) and vijnanashakti (the power of knowing).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Power of doing is the prAnashakti. prAna has a synonym which is vAyu. Prana inside, vAyu outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vijnanashakti, called also cit. Eyes seeing, ears hearing will not be enough&amp;hellip; Mind must be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The two branches of shakti (kriya, vijnana) have the same basis - mUlam, which is the atma. Out of atma comes shakti. If atma is brahman, then the shakti is maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is inside is outside and what is outside is inside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In outside you have cosmic intelligence and the cosmic power. They have the same origin in brahman. The inside intelligence and power have the same origin in atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For seeing the separation, you don&amp;rsquo;t need shastra. If there is something common, then you need shastra. Shastra says the body mind is not important, the base is.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Citta is different from person to person, from human to animals etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you see it is mostly vijnanashakti. When you speak it is the combination of kriya and vijnana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shiva weds Parvati. Shiva is the atma, parmati is the twofold shakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishnu weds Lakshmi and Bhudevi. Vishnu is the Atma, Lakshmi is the kriyashakti, Bhudevi is the jnanashakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Observe the breathing process. It will take you to the very awareness itself. It is obvious, because prana/vayu has originated in the atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Or be aware of the thinking process. Recognize it. Don&amp;rsquo;t contradict it. Don&amp;rsquo;t deny it. Don&amp;rsquo;t condemn it. Just be aware. The awareness of the chitta will take you to the source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Awareness is watching, observation without condemnation.&lt;/strong> Then you come to understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever you&amp;rsquo;re aware of without judging, you&amp;rsquo;ll come to understand.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is identification (positive thing), not condemnation (negative thing). Both are bad. Go for silent observation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You disturb you don&amp;rsquo;t watch. If you don&amp;rsquo;t watch you don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The secrets of life one can understand by (silent) observation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The personality is a myth. You&amp;rsquo;re not a person. It is the negation of the self so the egoistic self comes to an end. Breath will continue, thinking process will continue, person will be gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Very rarely you come across a person without demands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entire religion is demands and petition to god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ego-self is there only when you&amp;rsquo;re not alert, attentive, awarefull.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Watch natural phenomena, birds flight, clouds, rain. There is no possibility for condemnation nor identification, projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First vipassana teaching by bhagavan Buddha - have to enemies do for one month watch breath and they came back as friends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You divide people because of identification.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awareness is not a practice, not a habit, not a repetition. Awareness will always be fresh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is not an act. It is being. It is atma. That&amp;rsquo;s why it does not help phalam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="43httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmdm0yaawoeq---verse-13">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDM0yaawoEQ">43&lt;/a> - Verse 13&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Manah is always the thought. The thought that binds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bad vasana is painful, sometimes &lt;strong>even a good vasana becomes painful&lt;/strong>. E.g. obsessive vasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is vasana. Mind is in the form a few vasanas. You get only a certain kind of thoughts based on your vasanas.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to command the mind becomes the question of how to overcome vasanas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Discipline means understanding. Control means struggling.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not control (hathayoga), discipline - introduce some understanding into the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Laya - vasana is resolved and it will come back. Vinasha - vasanas are vanished, destroyed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manolayah, manonashah is language unique to Ramana Maharshi, but the vision is there in Gita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is the potential always, whatever has resolved, it can come back.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1st way to command the mind: watch the mind (manovikshanam) - it becomes quiet. 2nd way is through prana you command the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should follow both. Watch the breath, watch the mind. Certainly watching the mind is superior.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching the mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t eliminate the mind, only the vasanas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breath meditation may lead to naya, but will not lead to nasha. Supplement it with watching the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:chilA - is it not so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re born from thought.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manonashah - complete doing away with vasanas that bind us in this world. Fears and desires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sastra says the physical is less valuable than the subtle.&lt;/strong> Outside puja is less valuable than the inner. What you do with body (pujanam) is good, what you do with vac (japah) is better, what you do with mind (cintanam) is best.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami TV: one time I noticed I&amp;rsquo;m stingy. When I noticed it was gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you know that you&amp;rsquo;re in a certain condition, in a certain state. &lt;strong>You know and acknowledge that (without condemnation), that is already a process of liberation. You become free tom that. That&amp;rsquo;s the power of knowing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Confusion is the name for avidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramakrishna: a person knows god without knowing why he loves god. That is bhakti. That is liberation. But we practice religion as a means of security.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is sanyasa? You might have a bank account, but you don&amp;rsquo;t need the security of bank account. Psychological dependence on the bank account is a vasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Question your motive.&lt;/strong> Ask yourself why do you &amp;hellip; practice the religion you&amp;rsquo;re practicing? etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In Gita all motivated effort is not accepted. It is not against effort.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask yourself. &lt;strong>Are my ways godly? My thoughts are they godly? My existence is it godly?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you connect god to the vasana, the vasana will not go. God is very powerful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You must be simple inwardly only then you can be simple outwardly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="44httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvs9xa402pqpe---verse-14">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Xa402PqpE">44&lt;/a> - Verse 14&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What are you seeking, you&amp;rsquo;re that already.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Did you notice. &lt;strong>There is not much talk of God, there is only talk of moksha - freedom from bondage.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for God started after 10th century. In Gita Arjuna asked so many question. Did he aver asked how God is? Your innermost self is the goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even in Gita bhashya. Shankara might start with brahman, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much time to switch over to atma. And later he says the two are the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I&amp;rsquo;m that why I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m that? Mind is the culprit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What you call body is an idea of the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you have an body when you do not think of the body?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is an illness only when you think of it. The illness is not there, if you do not think of it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is the world you&amp;rsquo;re talking about? Do you have a world without mind and sense organs? They work in tandem and only then you have a world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>And then you need a god. To create that world. You&amp;rsquo;re that God. Because you&amp;rsquo;re illuminating the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three kinds of screens for atma: thick (tamoguna), opaque (rajoguna), transparent (sattvaguna). How does the screen (mind) cover up - it produces a variety of thoughts, beliefs, emotions &amp;hellip; non-stop.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What we&amp;rsquo;re looking for is vasanas becoming weak.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The idea is. You have to love the spouse. Not get attached. That&amp;rsquo;s poison while love is very full-filling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nowadays psychiatrist don&amp;rsquo;t counsel. Everybody wants fast results, so they prescribe pills. Is it treatment or is it suppression? Instead of suppression they call it management.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppression is called laya, vanishing is called nasha. We need laya. That is the first step. Then the treatment can begin. We need both.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breathawareness helps exclusively to get rid of the nasanas, to get laya. Pranayama not only helps in getting rid of vasanas (laya) but also helps in physical heath.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For atma to shine in all its glory you have to get understanding (cintanam) eka (the one). It brings all vasanas to an end and mind becomes see-through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eti iti eka. That pervades the all. &lt;strong>Because 1 you find in itself and in all the other numbers.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The goal is not to study vedanta and become a scholar. Do you want to get rid of diabetes or do you want to become an expert on diabetes having diabetes? Vedanta is not aimed at scholarship, it is ai/med at manonasha. Vanishing of the vasanas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Realization and bliss: &lt;strong>the actions, speech, thoughts are not tied to one body mind.&lt;/strong> They include all body minds. All life-forms. This way you self is not tied to one body-mind, but has become the universal self. It is not personal anymore. You have to feel this. That is the true religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Act of understanding is a religious act.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When mother prepares food and serves, in that karma (work hard), bhakti (preparation with love( and jnanam (knowledge how to cook) are the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Karma, bhakti, jnanam are all the same. If you try to separate them, it is the ignorance. That is the puja. There is no need for any puja.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adhiatma, adhibhuta, adhidaiva is the same. What I&amp;rsquo;m, the universe, the god is is the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m you and you&amp;rsquo;re I. That&amp;rsquo;s the worship of a student of Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only adopt worships that inspire you, lead you to oneness. Or modify your existing worships.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no lifeless river, mountain etc. It is awareness as river, awareness as mountain&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chaitanya definition: it is alive and it is aware. That&amp;rsquo;s how you have to see the world. Don&amp;rsquo;t set it down as inert.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the divisions, everything is a play of chaitanyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ekachintanam is a way how to do away with the egoism and merge in the universal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody likes persons who are always in their little-self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Universality is achieved by negation, putting aside the small-self, not enumerating I&amp;rsquo;m Australian, I&amp;rsquo;m New-Zealander, &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong> That way life becomes very smooth. You&amp;rsquo;ll not lose, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be selfish, but the right way. &lt;strong>Selflessness is the best kind of selfishness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="45httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqyaq_whv87y---verse-15">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYAq_WHV87Y">45&lt;/a> - Verse 15&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There must be conscious being to say mountain, only then there is a mountain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Anything comes into existence only when a conscious being knows it. Therefore it is not just mere existence, it is always existence+knowledge.&lt;/strong> Example: you see a mountain in a dream. Is it a mountain? If it would, your bed where you sleep would collapse under its weight. Therefore mountain is the same as mountain-thought + consciousness, therefore consciousness only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Original dhAtu: nash -&amp;gt; nasha = demolition. Disappearance is the better word, or vanishing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vasana is what converts the outer stimulus into huge suffering.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnani is not disturbed by wars, by what people says. He just remains very quiet. &lt;strong>In Jnanis state of mind there are no vasanas. No thoughts generated by vasanas&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The frequency of thoughts is very high in samsaris.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the number of thoughts increases, the quality comes down.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsari is concerned about his life. So he believes he takes care of his life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Uktrista yogi is not concerned about his life. Life takes are of life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Person is created by the mind, by vasana. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m me&amp;rdquo;. And I&amp;rsquo;m taking care of the body/mind. Life is taking care of the body/mind or the person is taking care of the body/mind?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever life is left to you that will be taken care by the life that pervades the body. Jnani knows it and therefore he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any insecurities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the mind-created-person is put aside the body remains in good shape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teaching has become a magic wand for us. Can you see that the &lt;strong>word &amp;ldquo;teaching&amp;rdquo; is teacher-centered. Learning is student-centric.&lt;/strong> Learning never ends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teaching means I know everything and you do not know anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Swami-TV: I&amp;rsquo;m not teaching. I&amp;rsquo;m learning, I&amp;rsquo;m inquiring with all of you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a difference between sorrow and sadness. &lt;strong>Sorrow is debilitating. Sadness is not.&lt;/strong> Sometimes you cannot help and people cannot be helped, e.g. are unsuited to help.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sadness makes you poetic, philosophic and teaches you about life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Natural state of the mind is thoughtlessness, silence. Like water is naturally placid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there are so many thoughts in the mind, you cannot understand, you cannot learn. When there is one thought, then you can learn a lot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you stop thinking (excessively) you will not become a zombie. It you do not you&amp;rsquo;ll suffer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No particular thought is natural state of mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Silence of the mind is not mindlessness, is not dullness, is not inaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For him there are no duties, no goals to be accomplished, no world to be saved, no students to be thought, no samsaries to be uplifted. All are uplifted already, all are brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re ajnani, all others appear as ajnanis - double ajnana. First know yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahatmas photograph has no value.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He (Maharshi) might do a few things, but he&amp;rsquo;s not duty bound. That&amp;rsquo;s why sometimes he answers and sometimes no.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People feel good when they have a lot of things. Jnani doesn&amp;rsquo;t need anything to be constantly happy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ashram food: breakfast: bread, peanut butter, milk, cereals, coffee, tea. Everything else is not necessary. Lunch: bread, brown rise, boil some vegetables. Dinner will be even simpler.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chup meditation: &lt;strong>There is nothing to be done, there is nothing to be avoided from doing. Because even &amp;ldquo;I should not do&amp;rdquo; becomes a vasana.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Belief is there because it gives us psychological security. You seek that security that&amp;rsquo;s why you believe.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="46httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvw-zggjtb0k8---verse-16">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-zgGjTb0K8">46&lt;/a> - Verse 16&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m that (intelligence pulsating through everything) by which I know I&amp;rsquo;m.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sharanagatti - we allow the small self to surrender to the real, to brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samatvam - you see the reality in all in-spite of outward differences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Live a life inspired by love and guided by knowledge.&lt;/strong> Understanding helps to move forward in the right direction, love to connect to others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Small self is guiding you to perform something to get the reward, or to get psychological security. Because people are concerned about them selves. That is not karma yoga. Karma yoga is about the absence of self-interest. Desire is not involved with karmayoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Phalam is the self interest. Give that up and work.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t try to manipulate the phalam - I will cause that phala by this karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People thing going to the temple and worshiping the god there is karma yoga. That is not necessary. Going to the office can be karma yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In India it was never about god. It was always about freedom. &lt;strong>Arjuna is asking for freedom (from confusion), not about god.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First before answering the question &amp;ldquo;is there a god?&amp;rdquo; let us discuss what is god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In life there are no yes/no answers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re not at all attached, maybe then we can say &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re playing a role&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re cit but you don&amp;rsquo;t know that. So you allow yourself to become citta (thought) then you see something nice and want to have it. That&amp;rsquo;s the downfall. From awareness absolute to the outward thing (drshya, the seen), the nama rupa. The real drashta is the caitanyam, everything else is the drsya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example for samsara, downfall of the cit: pure water coming from the mountain top becomes muddy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cellphone as become like an umbilical cord to the outward thing - drshya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there is internet, people cannot go inward.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve become very bahirmukha - outwardgoing people. We&amp;rsquo;ve to reverse the direction. That&amp;rsquo;s Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The sense of I&amp;rsquo;m - aham asmi - has no location. Initially we say it&amp;rsquo;s in the heart, because otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll be in the head. &amp;ldquo;Me&amp;rdquo; as a location in the braincells.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Withdraw the outgoing mind and turn it inwards.&lt;/strong> It is possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>An empty room is the most beautiful room. Because of space. Why do you go to beach?&lt;/strong> Because there is boundless space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inner silence is same as the spaciousness. If space is beautiful, all that beauty is in you. God is in you, Truth is in you, Love in you, Beauty is in you.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re looking outwards for these things in vain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop looking for something which is only within. When you go to the temple stand outside and say &amp;ldquo;aham vijnasu&amp;rdquo; then go inside, see all the idols and see &amp;ldquo;OM iti brahman&amp;rdquo;. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what is before you, it is all nama rupa. All is OM. Third, all that is god is within myself as the inner most self. Close the eyes and see. If you follow these three the temple visit is integrated in Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set your vision right. Drsyavadittam cittamatmanah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have a resistance to go within. Examine that. There might be fear of losing things of the world. Of losing your status in the society.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>As long as this &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; is with you, you&amp;rsquo;ll not understand &lt;strong>what is meditation. It is not a process, not a technique, not a method. You&amp;rsquo;ve to drop the question &amp;ldquo;how to meditate?&amp;rdquo; and ask &amp;ldquo;what is meditation?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Going to a dark room, isolating from the world around you, family, daily life. And you self-enclose yourself in a movement of the mind determined by the (dvaita) school of meditation you attend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not knowing. Understanding. For that you need spiritual energy. That&amp;rsquo;s the real kundalini.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Images. No that is not meditation. Image is in the present. Vision is in the future. Neither. Those who are striving for a vision they will get a vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you seeking happiness through the medium of meditation?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As a person you&amp;rsquo;ll never be happy and when you&amp;rsquo;re happy you&amp;rsquo;ll never be a person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is the movement of love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love. Is it the love of the one or of the many? Neither, it is &lt;strong>just love. Imagine a flower that spreads fragrance.&lt;/strong> It is not for one nor for many.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is gut constant awareness. On the surface there are base emotions. Be aware of all of that. Slowly penetrate. And you&amp;rsquo;ll reach a peace where you&amp;rsquo;re not there. You&amp;rsquo;re not a person, you&amp;rsquo;re not an ego. That peace, that beauty, that silence, that is meditation.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When Gita was started, there was dharma, not religions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the context of a dharmic civilization worship of Ishvara is called karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>500 CE something like religious ID started. Before there Christ&amp;rsquo;s teaching were there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Action is different than work. All natures works. Only humans act. Action is work performed by a human being with a motive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vivekananda. Humans are slaves. They don&amp;rsquo;t work like masters. They are slaves to the motives behind their acts. Suppose you erase the motive you&amp;rsquo;ll not be bound. This is what Shri Krishna was teaching. This is what will give you enthusiasm and courage!&lt;/strong> No motive and there is no sense of doership nor enjoyership.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breathing - work. Pranayama - action (maybe to reduce high heartbeat).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>One has to work anyway. But you induce motive (desire) into the work.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Origin of action is thought.&lt;/strong> Lay emphasis not on the outer (the benefits you&amp;rsquo;ll get), but on the thought. That makes you antarmuhka, otherwise youll remain bahirmukha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Organised religion fails us because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow us to place emphasis on the inner. It pulls you out of yourself and makes you put emphasis on the outer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another name for motive is desire for the action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Action - result - desire for the result - actor (doer). All of that is one movement. Unitary movement. Motivated thought becomes the origin of the action and creates the actor. The me (ego) which is also a thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Basic necessities of life are not motives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the language of Gita the motiveless thought is called pure.&lt;/strong> The very desire is impure. Impurities of the mind begin with &amp;ldquo;kama&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bondage doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on being brahmachari, sanjasi, grhasta. Bondage depends on being slave to one&amp;rsquo;s own imagination.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Desire to achieve an end brings about the will, which is the actor.&lt;/strong> Which is a process of becoming.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Narendra Modi: the more you throw mud of me the better the lotus blooms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our daily life the way we know it is a process of becoming.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus on the being, not on the becoming. All you want is in the being. Becoming is a strive, pain, constant battle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Horizontal vs. vertical movement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be totally devoted to the job/duty.&lt;/strong> Until the last breath. Don&amp;rsquo;t even think of motive, result, end. This is the devotion. It becomes the offering to the supreme god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The one who created the body/mind will take care of it&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ambition is a poisonous bread. Ambitious person lives for himself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human mind has a weakness wanting a yes/no answer. One of such question is about ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Darkness is. You switch on the light. It is not. Where is is?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In life there are no conclusions, there is only negation. There are no answers. There is only inquiry and it is timeless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The self is as it is not as it is imagined. The self remains veiled by the vasanas. And it reveals itself when there are no vasanas. That is called self-realization that leads to moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desirelessness is godliness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A brashtah is one who doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay on the course. The loss is not total. Whatever ground you&amp;rsquo;ve gained, you&amp;rsquo;ll not lose it. All worldly accomplishments (wealth, power, knowledge) will be lost. None of it transfers to the next birth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogabrastah - one who pursues desires and yoga together. He&amp;rsquo;ll go to heaven.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For a sincere seeker going to heaven would be a punishment. Same for a birth to a rich family. So a sincere seeker takes birth in a family of a seekers of truth. Not very well to do people. He&amp;rsquo;ll have the enormous advantage of satsang without doing any effort. He won&amp;rsquo;t have the enormous obstacles of heaven and riches.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gita praises birth in a poor family.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intelligence - the critical thinking, love for truth (yoga - self-knowledge), is sva.&lt;/strong> That is called here buddhi. That you&amp;rsquo;ll never lose and that transfers to the other life. Everything else is para (the other): wealth, accomplishments &amp;hellip; all you&amp;rsquo;ll lose with death of the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For truth, you need intelligence, not intellect. &lt;strong>Intelligence is the capacity to think freely. Without fear, without a formula.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any form of ambition is worldly. It breads anxiety and fear.&lt;/strong> Ambition, greed do not help to bring about a mind that is clear, direct, simple and intelligent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In one part of life the reading books, intellect, knowledge is required. In another part of life where you pursue the truth all of that is not going to help.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you prepare a formula, or formulate the pursuit of self-knowledge, it takes you towards knowledge, but not intelligence. Intelligence is very subtle, knowledge very gross.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wisdom, &lt;strong>self-knowledge comes into its own, when you understand the total process of your mind.&lt;/strong> That is intelligence. How it is creating jealousy, greed etc. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from studying books. To get that wisdom, you need not study a single book.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your mind is the result of entire community, family, sometimes entire country.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intelligence arises when there is no fear. If you&amp;rsquo;re afraid of God, devil who will punish. If you&amp;rsquo;re afraid of losing money, near and dear. When all that fear is ruling your life, you cannot become intelligent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The movement of fear is the movement of selfishness. Love is the movement of selflessness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no brastha in yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvq1ocvtjztoa">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oCvTjZtOA">Class 2&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wealth is a punishment, it prevents intelligence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the mind becomes quiet, the intelligence comes to the fore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the purpose of study? Am I embellishing the braincells or am I enriching my intelligence?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In work intelligence means karma yoga. In quarrel there is intelligence - you bless the adversary, understand that it is all very temporal and unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re able to love all - that is beauty. There is intelligence in beauty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no truth in beliefs. &lt;strong>There is intelligence in every aspect of life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instead of pursuing the truth the people pursue a system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brain is as mechanical as a machine. What you call knowledge is mechanical and accumulated - data.&lt;/strong> Whether it is in a GPS or in in the braincell (intellect).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you bring these vasanas to Vedanta it fails to deliver. &lt;strong>Vedanta is not so much intellect as intelligence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the operation of intelligence? An intelligent mind is constantly learning. You learn from a child, plant, animal, donkey&amp;hellip; It is an inquiring mind. Intelligence is not something you can acquire (para) and will lose, it is in you (sva). &lt;strong>When the mind is quiet, intelligence shines. Intelligence is hibernating in you, you wake it up.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generally in the presence of the mahatma the vasanas are resolved. When you go into the world and pursue worldly companies the vasanas wake up. And once they are active the jnana remains covered up - that&amp;rsquo;s the game that&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As he pursues the truth, as the intelligence is playing out, he knows his real being, his fullness. He&amp;rsquo;s not the body, he&amp;rsquo;s not born in this world, nor he&amp;rsquo;s going to die in this world. In fact the world springs from his consciousness and when he goes to sleep the world resolves in him. That&amp;rsquo;s the intelligence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The essence of ignorance - you feel you were born at a certain place, to a set of parents and you&amp;rsquo;ll die.&lt;/strong> And this you keep and nobody should disturb that. &lt;strong>How do you know? Because you experience? All of that is hear-say. Please meet me when you have first hand information! You live by hearsay and memory.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Action and actionless is not hostile to each other. They are together. That is intelligence. Natural thing happens naturally (what needs to be done gets done) yet you remain the actionlessness in yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The effort is in prakuruti (body/mind), there is no effort in yourself. This is samsiddhi.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the peace, that&amp;rsquo;s the bliss. A liberated person&amp;rsquo;s mind moves and still remains at peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsaris who do not see clearly have thousands of questions and they will never be answered clearly. &lt;strong>For a jnani no questions are left.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Heaven is a place of wealth and pleasures. There you&amp;rsquo;re not in your control anymore. You become overwhelmed. Therefore the question of pursuing self-knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t arise in heaven.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students of Vedanta performing kamyakarmas is an enormous contradiction.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviz54hve8qfu">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ54hVE8QfU">Class 3&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Failure in meditation is superior to success in worldly life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>brashta = failure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Failure in yoga can only be temporary. There can be no failure in yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga is a battle. You have to battle against your own base emotions and thinking. It is an inner battle. Sri Krishna Arjuna judham is an inner battle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Base emotions always talk of me and mine and pandavah (pandu = whiteness), which is symbol for jnanam. Thoughts and emotions emanating from understanding. And there is a battle and it is called yoga.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In judging, comparing, contrasting &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re only exercising your conditioning.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The game: you perform the karma and seek the karma phalam. All that the vijnasu (student of atma) puts aside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seek quality of life, not longevity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Traigunya premi: pursues wealth, pleasure, punyam (through rituals).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve a connect to karmas only as long as you&amp;rsquo;re not dispassionate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How do you look at yourself determines the course of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Yoga: separation idea has ended&lt;/strong>. Union with the truth, real, god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogi is who was &lt;strong>clarity and earnestness&lt;/strong> required for self-knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who worship the pointing finger miss the moon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga is the maturity of heart and mind. It does not come just by reading books, but when you start living whatever little you&amp;rsquo;ve understood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no such thing as a compromise in yoga. The very idea of compromise blocks the way to the truth. &lt;strong>Compromise shows a lack of earnestness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind will always have problems. It is never free of problems. One way. Hathayoga: try to cure the way. Vedanta: dissociate from the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is never free problems. Because &lt;strong>mind is addicted to problems. Without problems it feels lost, that&amp;rsquo;s why it wants sudoku, puzzles.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t accept life on its terms. We want life on my terms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the inner journey you&amp;rsquo;re alone. Don&amp;rsquo;t try one more person to join you.&lt;/strong> It is impossible. &amp;ldquo;Me and my wife meditation do meditation together&amp;rdquo; - that is not possible. You can do a puja together. More clever people say guru.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guru is not the person. Guru is the vision. Shankara is before me as a person or as a version? We&amp;rsquo;re always in communion with Shankara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you dissociate with mind it will change. It will complain less.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga: intense and methodical investigation into the movement of the mind. For hathayoga: suppression.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind has to be relaxed for yoga. Mind has to be free of desires and then it can relax. This freedom doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from grim determination.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Understanding comes when you pay attention.&lt;/strong> Pay attention to the mind. By understanding the mind you become free from the mind. &lt;strong>That is the meditation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you pay attention to the sun it becomes the gayatri mantra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In paying attention to the pain you get the quality of endurance. As you do it the quality of pain can change. We don&amp;rsquo;t rush to the doctor or for the pill. That is meditation, yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Narcissist, ahamkari wants admiration all the time. Check if you have the quality in you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You become free from you&amp;rsquo;ve understood.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv93-jmdmx0ri">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-JmdMx0rI">Class 5&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One who arrives at yoga (self-knowledge, jnanam) is yogi. Self-knowledge unites you with the whole.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Promises made by the religion sound like the promises by the politicians.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dharma, artha, kama cannot solve the problem of samsara. Only yoga, connect with the inner reality can.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Understanding is followed by action.&lt;/strong> That understanding is yoga. You&amp;rsquo;ve to get that understanding with appropriate effort. The organism (psychology + physiology) must be in very good shape, fit for it:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>food: simple diet in moderate quantities. Otherwise the organism will be dull and you&amp;rsquo;ll not get the understanding,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>regular good sleep,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>take physical exercise regularly (both in the morning and evening).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then ponder over the sublime teachings of Gita and Upanishads and live those things in daily life. That is how you prepare.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be in constant company of saintly and spiritually-minded people. Who practice that wisdom in their life and can inspire peace and tranquility in you. If that company is not available, remain alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On daily basis look within and see the well-entrenched ignorance in your consciousness and recognise it as such. Having done that make a daily effort to rise above the body mind and intellect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Carefully avoid the company of people who disturb your peace of mind.&lt;/strong> Of worldly people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upanishad is direct and straightforward. Gita is very complex.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be congruent. Unity in thought, speech, deeds. Trikarana shudhi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be generous. You cannot be harsh, aggressive, insensitive. Be charitable, kind, helpful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Real is universal. Real includes all. Person is separated. And now it has to escape from the shackles of me and mine and merge with the universal self. That we call yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Popular religion hallmarks: desires, fears and selfishness. If you&amp;rsquo;re a very good religious person you&amp;rsquo;ve these three qualities. Yoga is desirelessness, fearlessness, selflessness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogi doesn&amp;rsquo;t harm even a plant. Harmlessness is the most powerful part of yoga. Ahimsa paramo dharmah. Buddha, Mahavira, Jesus Christ &amp;hellip; all mahapurushas talk of ahimsa. Harmlessness is given a name: nissargayoga - natural yoga. Harmlessness: the art of living in peace and harmony.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shiva is pragna (understanding). Parvati is prana. Bringing together wisdom and life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your mind is the sishya. Life is the guru.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People convert Vedanta shravanam into a routine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study is listening to know. Purpose of listening to Vedanta is to undergo the inner transformation. What kind? Ugly looking larva transmutates into a butterfly. Happy, desireless, fearless universal self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The little egoistic self has to be transformed to the supreme self, the brahman. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason why you&amp;rsquo;d come to Vedanta class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramathirta: give up the evil companion of desire in your heart. &lt;strong>What is evil? Entertaining a desire in your mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transformation of the nature: &lt;strong>I seek nothing&lt;/strong>. I&amp;rsquo;m thirsty I need water - that&amp;rsquo;s not desire. I need Coca-Cola - that&amp;rsquo;s a desire, that will hurt you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By desiring something limited you&amp;rsquo;re denying your nature of brahmanhood. You&amp;rsquo;d not lose heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Convert the failures into steppingstones. Do not relax your effort to gain that inner transformation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kilbishah is a blemish which amounts to &amp;ldquo;sin&amp;rdquo; in Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as you identify with the physical body, you cannot realize your oneness with the absolute. You&amp;rsquo;ll not able to achieve anything in life (university - intellect, sport, military - suffering, no comfort) what to speak of Vedanta?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To grow to the yoga you need to put away the superstitions. Examine your superstitions, if you&amp;rsquo;re not the body all of them will collapse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ID with time is another sin.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transform consciousness where there is no division of good and evil. Good and evil is not for you. &lt;strong>Is Ukraine evil and Russia good? Or is Russia good and Ukraine evil? Go beyond.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rise above time, space and good and evil divisions. That is when you reach the goal of self-realization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is only one way to realize God: as the inner most self. To arrive there you&amp;rsquo;ve to extricate the self that is embedded in body, time, space, opposites of pleasure/pain&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then one more kilbishah - fear. Fear is slavery, fear is cowardice. You need courage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot psychologically depend on others for your upliftment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is cat coming from left or right a bad omen? As long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t jump on you it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Death is God. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;d look in the face of death and smile!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another kilbishah - worldly pomp and show. All the glamour and glory that we pursue is very transient.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="part-1-2">Part 1, 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Teaching from the Gita is more practical as that of Upanishad. Closer to the ordinary life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The body is the chariot. Arjuna is the master of the chariot. You&amp;rsquo;re Arjuna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be clean. Be frank. Be like an open book. One who&amp;rsquo;s like that is Arjuna. No crookedness, no crafty-ness, innocence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tree is called Arjuna because it soars straight into the sky.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you keep a distance between you and the teaching, you&amp;rsquo;ll be quoting Gita, not living Gita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no outside enemies. You&amp;rsquo;re (thoughts, qualities of head and heart) your own enemy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideation is not knowledge, idea is not the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kama is an attitude of desiring and people are addicted to it. Constantly desiring one thing or the other. It becomes a habit. But it cannot withstand the scorching of examination, knowledge. Similarly krodha, mada (arrogance).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Sanskrit life is called prAna. pra-ana. Movement. Life is that which makes all this movement, functions possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love is not of the mind, attachment is. Love, peace, bliss are from a deeper source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Happiness has an opposite. Bliss not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That peace nobody can disturb once you discover it. Nobody can assail it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagine somebody tells a good joke. You&amp;rsquo;re laughing heartily. You as a person will not be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love is unknown, but not inaccessible. It is supremely accessible but you cannot know it. And you come to it by discarding the known. Love cannot be discovered by a mind full of the known.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say to a person &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo; you don&amp;rsquo;t love the person. You want to possess, hold the person. When you try to do it, you&amp;rsquo;ll get jealousy if you believe the person is possessing by somebody else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, love is not a sentiment. To be sentimental is the same as being emotional. Emotionalism is but a sensation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you see somebody dancing (as love of god) suspect the person right away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sentimental person cannot know what is love because the sentiment will turn it in opposite direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In bhakti you&amp;rsquo;re very calm and quiet. And that quietude expresses in the body outside and inside (mind is resolved), so that you abide as the awareful being. Love is the fragrance of that awareful being. That love is called bhaktih.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If Lord Krishna would be standing here in front of us you&amp;rsquo;d consider him escaped from a drama company.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Concentrating on form you have to struggle to make it happen. To concentrate on space you need not only give up. It is so easy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware that you&amp;rsquo;re in embrace of this power.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you retain your persona and want to love that already is the denial of love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gita bhasya is very tough, brahmasutra the opposite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsari: I love the rose. Bhakti: I love the glory of Ishvara that is in the rose. Ravana being a criminal doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent Rama from seeing the glory of Ishvara in him. You&amp;rsquo;d be able to see the glory of Ishvara in everything, thus loving everything because everything is a conduit through which the glory of Ishvara is becoming abundantly clear, recognizable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="part-3-4">Part 3, 4&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Evidence -&amp;gt; existence -&amp;gt; nama rupa. Works better with nose, ears than with eyes - the progression is too fast. We&amp;rsquo;re so attached to nama rupa (last step) that we miss the first two.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It exists, therefore it is evident. Vasu (asti) deva (bhati). That astibhati is Ishvara, that is called Vasudeva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cognize nama rupa, but learn to be aware of the presence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can feel the presence with closed eyes (touch) more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water&amp;rsquo;s specific gravity is 1, body 1.9. If only people remain calm, they will not sink.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakti: feeling and recognising the presence of Ishvara in all of the things. Deva (Vasudeva) is the feeling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be always conscious of the blissful and real aspect of the five elements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water is also called sa:jivanam. It is life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While you&amp;rsquo;re inhaling, there is bliss. When you&amp;rsquo;re exhaling, there is a small anxiety. By inhaling you can feel the power of life, by exhaling the power of death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Space represents the power of gravity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why can&amp;rsquo;t you accept a tree, piece of stone, river, cow, dog, kid, any human &amp;hellip; as divinity?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn to give up the nama rupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mental form - criminal. Physical form - human.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to rise above the forms, the words, the syllables to get the meaning. Similarly you&amp;rsquo;ve to rise above the forms of idols etc. to get the divinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divine vision: you visualize Isvhara everywhere and Ishavara only and none other that Ishavara. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the divine bliss anywhere and at any time. The whole world becomes the temple of god. Whatever you do becomes worship. That&amp;rsquo;s ananyabhakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishvarupa: any head on the earth is Isvhara&amp;rsquo;s head. That&amp;rsquo;s why he&amp;rsquo;s infinite. Every life form is his manifestation. That&amp;rsquo;s why no himsa. It is more then ethics and morals. It is the divine vision that stops you from hurting another life form.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-5-6">Class 5, 6&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Believers will be always insecure unless they have some other believers around. That&amp;rsquo;s why they seek to convert people. They see security in numbers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One iota of experience is superior to a ton of precept.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pick one idea and live it. A living idea is superior to a ton of precept.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SakshatkAra: I&amp;rsquo;m because I&amp;rsquo;m, not because I see, not because I think.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the thinking of a devotee god is always compassionate. Because the devotee needs compassion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Common aim of the upasana is to abolish the diversity of names of form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To discover brahman in the worldly objects and also in yourself. So we don&amp;rsquo;t look at phrtivi as a means of sense gratification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you love, there is no one that loves apart from the feeling of love. If the person is there that is cupidity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desirelessness doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong. Desire belongs (to the small self). As it (desire/fear) springs up it brings above the person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even after thinking for 10 minutes I don&amp;rsquo;t find something to desire. Be like that!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no fear means there is no person. It means you&amp;rsquo;re merged into divine vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wanting a heaven in future means you&amp;rsquo;re currently living in the hell. Looking for it will convert the present to hell. Heaven in future = credit in future religion. We want cash religion = bliss now and here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not talking. Talking happens. Mahatmas talk. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a problem with the vision? Go and complain to Sri Krishna or Shankara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have 10 rupees you can give 1/2 to a person and the other to somebody else. You can give the same amount of love to one person and to the other. It is infinite, it is like space. It is a fragrance of the being. The appreciation for the chaitanyam/life everywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the same vision, depth, as an Upanishad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have already studied Vedanta it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to have an open mind. What can I teach you? You already know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listen without judging, with open mind, that&amp;rsquo;s meditation. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to take all this to the level of meditation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you live a life of karma yoga you&amp;rsquo;re already a liberated soul.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You see the snake instead of a garment because you&amp;rsquo;re insecure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generally for Vedanta classes vijnasus (student of Vedanta) don&amp;rsquo;t come. Parents come.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents should intervene with difficulties of the students only when the situation becomes very abnormal. Let them face the music!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m - sat - existence. I know - chit. You always know, whether there is something to know or not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do not quiten the mind (you, you &amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s hathayoga). If you try it will revolt. Allow it to become quiet (that&amp;rsquo;s vedanta). It can, if you allow it. Quieting the mind will put you in an everlasting conflict. If the mind wants to come with a never lasting train of thought - let it. You&amp;rsquo;d be able to say &amp;ldquo;I do not mind when the mind is thinking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sharanagatih - self-surrender, not only surrender. Surrender of the small-self. It&amp;rsquo;s something to be understood, not something to be done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In life, whenever you&amp;rsquo;re acting, you&amp;rsquo;ve to ask if the actions are motivated. That&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of sharanagatih.&lt;/strong> When you act purposefully, your action is very meaningful, but you do not have any (self-ish) motive behind the action. It means &lt;strong>you&amp;rsquo;re not trying to control, to accomplish anything, because everything is controlled and commanded by the prime mover&lt;/strong> (antaryAmi - abiding in everything, commanding and controlling). You just do what is expected of you. This is understanding god, this is difficult. Believing is simple.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever you record in your mind is impressed there for so long that it is very difficult to wipe it out and begin again. And therefore we never catch anything fresh. That&amp;rsquo;s why having an open mind is very difficult. Without putting existing aside you learn nothing fresh, you&amp;rsquo;ll be recycling only. That&amp;rsquo;s not understanding. &lt;strong>Knowledge is the old tape - memory. Understanding is in the present moment.&lt;/strong> Knowledge accumulates in the braincells, understanding shines in the heart and liberates. Can we put aside the old way of thinking (bible: the old person)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Become free from the old. You can do that by only one way. Paying attention.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>In Sanskrit seeing and knowing are taken as the same. Seer (drg) means knower. Seeing is more than knowing, it carries a punch in it which knowing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have. &amp;ldquo;Do you know Vaikuntha?&amp;rdquo; Like that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Objects, need not be physical, are all part of the seen (drshya). The seen is more than just physical, all your ideas that you have. Except you, everything else is the seen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karana and karya vada are the words of the dualist. Very provisional theory. Before you become victim of this, you have to move to drg drshya viveka to be safe from duality and unfortunate mix-up of religion and philosophy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The line of argument here is the discernment between you, the knowing element, and all that is known.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not any of the things that you imagine about yourself. Provisionally we give you a title &amp;ldquo;jiva&amp;rdquo;. Because you do not allow the divinity to come out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you give drg drshya viveka a chance, it will force you into your divinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purify the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;ve collected so much it that it becomes a big task. How you do it? No effort, just vichara. Knowing the false as the false, investigation, is the toughest thing. People go for the easy thing and avoid the real one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guru will not, cannot break the shell from outside. You&amp;rsquo;ve to do it from inside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who want to see UFOs will see UFOs. &lt;strong>Those who think of a god in a way will see god such way. Mind becomes the God. What you see, what you know cannot be the truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma, upasana is outward looking. Jnanam, yoga is inward looking. They cannot be combined.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma -&amp;gt; phala later. It is mediate. Realization has immediate benefit. Like with rope and snake. Now and here. Can there be understanding in the future? Understanding happens only in the present. Only death happens in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Sanskrit, &amp;ldquo;cha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ka&amp;rdquo; are interchangeable. Lochanam -&amp;gt; luk (taking &amp;ldquo;ana&amp;rdquo; way makes guna go away too and &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;ch&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; are interchangeable).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prepare your consciousness in which you do not pay attention to the form. Form is unimportant, because it is not real. &lt;strong>The more you pay attention to the form, the more you have emotional investment to the form, the more trouble you&amp;rsquo;re creating yourself.&lt;/strong> It is always the false that binds. Truth liberates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Memory makes you think a lot. Keep it away when you don&amp;rsquo;t need it.&lt;/strong> We&amp;rsquo;re registering forms since we can remember. How many did we see? There is mental forms, like boundaries between countries, too. The form is known to you, don&amp;rsquo;t make it into &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is is the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:itara - en:other. The other means limited means measurable. Jnanam of &amp;hellip; is invalid in the context of brahman, valid in any other case.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are looking elsewhere for solution of problems of life, happiness. Towards the physical things made of hand, towards another person, towards god. All in vain. Because you must begin with yourself, in yourself. Antarmukhah. Viveka: stop searching outside what can be found only within.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clarify the mind (of superstitions), purify the heart (do not entertain emotions like hatred, jealousy) and then sanctify your life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Life is a series of experiences.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga people are dualist, they include people in the aham experience. Bhatka people are dualist too, they include god in the idam experience. Vedantins also say god has to be included in the aham experience only, but go one step further and say aham-brahma-asmi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>idam is aneka. Aham is always eka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drshyam is jada, drg is chetana. &lt;strong>Is what I&amp;rsquo;m worshiping jada?&lt;/strong> There is any numbers of inadequacies in drshya. Drshya is very fickle, it changes, anything can happen to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Literality is religion and spirituality is philosophy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhaktas take sentimentality as atmajnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All I see in this hall is limited. But my eyesight is not limited. It can see anything and everything.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pascal: as a body I am but a speck in this universe, but with my mind I can assess everything in it. Mind is the seer, that is it&amp;rsquo;s glory. Now go one step further, mind becomes the seen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to give importance to the rupa. Learn to ignore the rupa. You love something that is beyond the rupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a form disintegrates, I feel neutral. And when the person was suffering, I feel good about it. People are getting grief-stricken for no reason. Because they invest so much emotionalism in to that form.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not that you&amp;rsquo;ve questions and I&amp;rsquo;ve answers. We examine things together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many questions show that you&amp;rsquo;re thining. Most important is that you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. &lt;strong>Once you start thinking and paying attention you&amp;rsquo;ll find all answers in yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sanyasa is neither necessary nor sufficient condition for moksha. Sanyasa in spirit you&amp;rsquo;d have. What you have to give up is desire - people don&amp;rsquo;t like that. &lt;strong>Desireless-ness leads to fearlessness. Desirelessness and fearlessness together constitute moksha.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the sanyasa you require.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For some people, who don&amp;rsquo;t fit into family life and equally not to worldly life, sanyasa is the avenue available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People want to maintain diabetes or do you want to get rid of it? Same applies for desires. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to manage them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Root cause of anxiety is desire, expectation and anticipation.&lt;/strong> Attachment breads fear, of which anxiety/worry is only a form of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Only a doer can have a goal. If you have a goal to be reached, you become anxious.&lt;/strong> Surrender the self to Ishvara. If Ishvara wishes, we&amp;rsquo;ll reach whatever we have to reach. &lt;strong>Allow the natural thing happen naturally. Be a guide upon yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is the thought that generates stress.&lt;/strong> Stress is related to anxiety.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being a worldly person how can you get rid of anxiety? You cannot!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cellphone makes you anxious. How many times you check your email is a measurement of your anxiety.&lt;/strong> Cellphone is the umbilical cord to the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Am I playing the role of the father or am I bound by the role?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You have to protect your heart, that is your wealth. Your heart is hiranmayakosha, the treasure full of light of awareness, in that Brahma is shining as atma. You&amp;rsquo;ve to protect it from worldliness. And that is accomplished by satsanga.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;d not talk much. &lt;strong>Talking much makes the mind becomes hyperactive.&lt;/strong> It will acquire tremendous speed. Remain alone and disengage with the worldly things, people, context. Don&amp;rsquo;t attend any marriages, festivals, functions., celebrations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the temple you don&amp;rsquo;t come across bhaktas. You come across fathers, mothers, afraid people, desirers. Don&amp;rsquo;t enter the threshold of a temple with identification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever be the rupa you come across in a temple, say &amp;ldquo;OM&amp;rdquo;. All are OM, nothing else. The Ishvara is in my heart as the inner most self. So you attachment to form is replaced by the sound &amp;ldquo;OM&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who&amp;rsquo;s learning? &lt;strong>There is no &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo;! That&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ve to learn. There is only ajnanam, no ajnani.&lt;/strong> There is only illness, there is no sick person. Does the physician threat the patient or the illness? He doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize a patient, only an illness. Jiva is only provisional, sruti goes along for a while until you know that you&amp;rsquo;re brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is entirely about unlearning.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Meditation
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You do not have any issues in life if you&amp;rsquo;re in the present&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guide yourself. Two deep breaths will bring you into present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While breathing out, imagine you throw out (mercilessly and forcefully) the anxieties also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prana and mind are connected. One effects the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be aware of the sounds but do not name it&lt;/strong> e.g. that is a motor, I know it&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t allow that train of thoughts. Without all that movement of the mind you can still be aware of the sound. You&amp;rsquo;ve reached the state of inner silence, as you&amp;rsquo;re aware.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That inner silence is the foundation of life. It&amp;rsquo;s not void, it&amp;rsquo;s full to the brim. You&amp;rsquo;re as a person are not there. That&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;strong>samadhi of the vedantins&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless there is a contrast, you&amp;rsquo;ll not see anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you see things, you start judging the things. Now you&amp;rsquo;ve started your samsara.&lt;/strong> Started at the very young age and it will be going on and on. Aindriyaka jivanam - focus on what the sight cognizes. &amp;ldquo;World is full of opposites and god it&amp;rdquo;. Why should he? No, it was you!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eyesight is like a mirror, not like a camera. It reflects the forms and then forms are erased. You remain clean, free from forms. Where do you want to focus, on the outside of forms with opposites? These opposites bind people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People are not selling beauty (roses, jewelry, building, art, landscape, tree&amp;hellip;). They are selling ideas!&lt;/strong> The quality of the beauty is not out there. People who assume so are living a life of aindriyaka jivanam - in a dream. And all of it will collapse. Beauty is in you. When the mind is silent, the awareful being comes into the fore and there is a beauty in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No self-centered activity - activity without seeking anything for one self. It&amp;rsquo;s there in you. Only you have to make it more pronounced. You&amp;rsquo;re not egoistic all the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind, which has no self-centered activity in it, is the most beautiful thing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any time you assume there is joy in the outer it will cheat you, it will prove to you unequivocally that there is no joy in it. Joy is not an attribute of the outer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life a life of viveka, viveki jivan, not aindriyaka. Every time you pay the price for sukham with dukham. Stop seeking any sukham and you&amp;rsquo;ll not know what&amp;rsquo;s dukham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eyesight is not really drg, it is drshyam. It is not the subject. It can be good / bad. But who is the subject now? Mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing means knowing the forms. Hearing mean knowing the sounds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you focus on the sounds you&amp;rsquo;re in dvaita. When you focus on the hearing you&amp;rsquo;ve come into the advaita.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the sounds you&amp;rsquo;re listening. When you name the sound and judge it you&amp;rsquo;re hearing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Music is not in the notes. It is in the silence between the notes. Notes are outside, you hear those notes and in between is the silence and in that silence is the music. R-a-m-a is what I hear. When it is complete there is a silence. And in that silence there is the knowledge of Rama. Silence is not void, it is fullness. It has everything. All knowledge, all joy, all beauty is in you. Satyam-shivam-sundaram.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fragrance is not outside. Outside is a flower with aromatic volatile oil, which throws out molecules. A few of them enter into your nose and create the joy of fragrance in the receptors in your nose. Same for skin. Important only: nama &amp;amp; rupa. All sense work in the same way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sweetness is in the tongue, not in the object. Therefore do not pay attention to the multiple objects, pay attention to the tongue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why should you drink sweet drinks? It&amp;rsquo;s not worth drinking. Water is.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The word &amp;ldquo;knowledge&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;knowing&amp;rdquo; is already reserved for ideation. When you say it it could be only an &amp;ldquo;idea&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From from &amp;ldquo;namarupa&amp;rdquo; into the thing. That&amp;rsquo;s called study of Vedanta. Everything else is conceptual study. There is no value in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spiritual dimension cannot be introduced in itself. It has to be introduced through the drsya. Provisionally present the psychological dimension as the drg (which it is in reference to the physical) and through it then take you into the higher dimension. That&amp;rsquo;s the job of the speaker, that can be done only with cooperation with the student.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is the stepping stone into the spirit.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is not one thing. It&amp;rsquo;s a bag.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waking consciousness is the background of the mind&amp;rsquo;s movement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The brain has two lobes. One is intellect, the other deals with emotions and is called mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you look at your consciousness you can clearly notice how it is moving. In there there is kama (desires). It becomes a habit with people and they cannot live in comfort. Always uneasy or disturbed, because something or the other is missing. Where ever you put them, they complain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instead of teaching simplicity the religion teaches desires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you give a freedom to the mind it has a set of questions. And if answer is given you feel very happy. There is a joy in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tamasi dhrtih is all about eating. Rajasi about ambition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accumulated knowledge will disintegrate, not understanding. Learning is accumulation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you psychologically depend on the other person, you&amp;rsquo;re insecure. What will happen when the other person doesn&amp;rsquo;t oblige? When you&amp;rsquo;re dependent on the money, you&amp;rsquo;ll become very insecure when you lose it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m giving up this and I&amp;rsquo;m ready for whatever consequence. Then you&amp;rsquo;re ready for sanyasa. Retirement, 401k funds, insurance are all born from the sense of insecurity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ve to examine whether you&amp;rsquo;ve that sense of insecurity in you. Am I afraid of death? Illness? Maybe yes. That means there is some identification. I have to work on it. Are you afraid when you&amp;rsquo;re alone? No. Good, you&amp;rsquo;re not psychologically dependent on somebody.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the book of your mind, that you&amp;rsquo;ve to read.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Real is in you. And the mind is there as a gatekeeper, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to embrace the reality. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re that already. But you don&amp;rsquo;t feel it. You don&amp;rsquo;t feel that divinity, fullness. Ask yourself: Do I feel inadequate?&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the fullness. Actually it&amp;rsquo;s more negative. You do not feel insecurity, you feel love for all. Even you love the door to the point that you don&amp;rsquo;t bang it. You just close it carefully. You love a paper, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste it. When you love this insentient objects, what to speak of people? Including those, who throw some dust on you. That&amp;rsquo;s divinity. &lt;strong>YOU HAVE TO FEEL IT, IT IS NOT INTELLECTUAL. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve much purpose.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can&amp;rsquo;t feel the brahmanhood only because the mind is making too much noise. Just like clouds are enough to cover the sun. Mind veils your swarupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love is not sentimentality, love is not attachment. Dismiss all sentimentality, attachment, aversion and all those things and then you come to love. You feel love. Feel it to all. You feel the sense of love towards a friend and towards a foe equally. That love is brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is not chetana. It is physical, material. Mirror is the sand only that was heated to few thousand degrees. Body and mind are of the same material. Mind is very subtle. Yet it is physical thing. A machine. Mind also moves and produces thoughts. &lt;strong>Mind is the machine of thought process.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you look at yourself notice a flow of thoughts. That&amp;rsquo;s the mind. Suppose you notice there is no thought. Who knows that there is no thought. Are you not aware of the thoughtless state of mind? The thoughtlessness, the gap between a thought and another is with you. When you sneeze, you don&amp;rsquo;t think. If you pay attention to something, the thought comes to an end. And then comes again. &lt;strong>To whom is known the thought process. Watch your mind. Stand apart from it and understand it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop the space of being aware of the thoughts/emotions. That means you&amp;rsquo;re already free from it. You&amp;rsquo;ve stepped back. &lt;strong>Who&amp;rsquo;s that that&amp;rsquo;s free from it? The one who&amp;rsquo;s aware of it!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our greed is the investment for the corporate world.&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Just be totally devoted to the job. Forget about corporate people pushing their ways etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop finding scapegoats, always look within.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God bless him.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If he&amp;rsquo;s right, I learned something about me and I&amp;rsquo;ve got something to correct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If he&amp;rsquo;s wrong, thank god he&amp;rsquo;s wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Face all the challenges with courage. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;d never appeal to the outside, man or god, but to the god who&amp;rsquo;s in you.&lt;/strong> He&amp;rsquo;s listening to you and always watching you. He&amp;rsquo;s atma, sakshi he&amp;rsquo;s. Appeal to the inner sakshi and take blessing from him and move forward.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing Niagara on the Internet is just nama rupa. You must see and lose yourself in the seeing. That seeing is brahman. The fact, the truth of seeing is brahman. The seer seen superimposition is samsara. Therefore you&amp;rsquo;ve to go to Niagara. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how many times you&amp;rsquo;ve done it, it&amp;rsquo;s always new. It&amp;rsquo;s always for the first time. Meet anything and everything fresh! The number doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, it&amp;rsquo;s memory, unreal.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Few drops of rain on my head I consider a great blessing. In that raindrop I see the origin of all the oceans of the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is always fresh, we only look at it through the prism of the memory and then it becomes stale.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I look at the jealousy. It&amp;rsquo;s very familiar for all of us. I&amp;rsquo;m aware of it, without condemnation. It&amp;rsquo;s natural consequence of comparison, of the way we&amp;rsquo;ve been brought up. It&amp;rsquo;s not a crime. And that I see that it hurts myself and goes against the vision of Vedanta. Jealousy has no meaning,&lt;/strong> I learn a lesson. This is not accumulative knowledge. From then on I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling jealous.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What you learn is not accumulation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeking: substitute seeking with striving and everything will be all-right. Generally people are not earnest. They are just seekers. By habit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two kinds of impurities of the mind. Sakashaya dosha - jealousy, anger, etc. Nishkashaya dosha - hyperactivity of the mind, restlessness. You cannot sit for 5 minutes. Simple pranayama will help.

&lt;li>Give up multitasking. Be devoted to one task at the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multitasking will not increase productivity. It compromises productivity.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Religion is belief, philosophy is rational thinking. See &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUnCgTyqboo&amp;amp;list=PLd6RYR-zr5hFheEjd_0ZjTyCLpbLCMScU">Bhakta &amp;amp; Bhakti&lt;/a> talks.

&lt;li>easy vs. difficult&lt;/li>
&lt;li>divides vs. unites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>binds you vs. sets you free, no shackles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you&amp;rsquo;re a doer vs. you&amp;rsquo;re a non-person&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Idea that Pujaswami will take birth again is not correct. Atma is the same for all. The only difference is that a mahatma knows it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the youngsters. They are more dharmic than us.&lt;/strong> They are certain elements of dharma in us that they don&amp;rsquo;t have. &lt;strong>They are more catholic than us. Future generations are already safe. Only we&amp;rsquo;re not safe yet. We have to pay attention to ourselves.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Sun illuminates everything&amp;rdquo;. You cannot say that. There is no doing on the part of the sun. It just is. When the sun is, everything gets illuminated. &amp;ldquo;Sun illuminates&amp;rdquo; is also not correct. &lt;strong>Illumination is not an action (sun doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a broomstick and removes the darkness). &amp;ldquo;Sun is the shining&amp;rdquo;. Sun is the light. Nothing more, no verb there.&lt;/strong> Same for brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A wrong question cannot be answered, it can be only seen/understood as a wrong question.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for something, it can be only death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantins love death, mrtyuh. Brahmavidyacarya - kathopanishad.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Singularity. Time is the byproduct of creation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A believing person is a not a thinking person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are like children. They want children. And they believe the stories wholeheartedly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People live superficially. They believe. Asking questions makes you go into the depths of consciousness and investigate.&lt;/strong> Living on the surface makes us very agitated. That&amp;rsquo;s the movement of the mind. Like a cork on a water with a lot of disturbance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you look at the mind are you not already free from the limitations of mind?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I notice my limitation. Lo behold, &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m aware of my limitation. And you should not condemn it, if you do you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the game. So I&amp;rsquo;m free of that limitation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The entire movement of the mind is an object. Don&amp;rsquo;t give the mistake of giving it the status of the subject.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m observing but without being an observer. Otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m an egotistic observer. Observing and judging, justifying, assessing, evaluating, condemning. Do you know &lt;strong>how ego operates? It condemns what it observes.&lt;/strong> Example: somebody tells I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot. Will I become an idiot only because somebody says so? &lt;strong>When you observe, you&amp;rsquo;ll not get hurt.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert is same as aware. Alert means ego is not there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Observation without condemnation. Means without ID. That is the definition of awareness. Awareness brings understanding. Justification, ID, condemnation &amp;hellip; there is no understanding. If you have understanding, there is no frustration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When Rama met Ravana for the first time he gave him a piece of advice. &amp;ldquo;Nothing is lost, release Sita, go home and live a long life&amp;rdquo;. There is no enmity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is &lt;strong>no end in view.&lt;/strong> No &amp;ldquo;let me be aware to get moksha in three months&amp;rdquo;. Just trust the process. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re focused on the process, not on the end.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awareness is not self-improvement. The egoistic self is the false self. Don&amp;rsquo;t bring drg drsya viveka to the level of psychology. In psychology the mind is real. Here only atma is real. On the contrary it is the end of the small &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; which is there in the braincells. You don&amp;rsquo;t find this &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; in no other part of the body but braincells. Don&amp;rsquo;t be head people (kundalini goes to the head). Be heart people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ego holds memory. That&amp;rsquo;s why when the braincells become weak, memory is lost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Krishna: &amp;ldquo;As long as you&amp;rsquo;re pursuing moksha you&amp;rsquo;ll not get it&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as you take yourself as a person, guru be a person. And god will be another person. You&amp;rsquo;re not a person, but tattvam. So is guru, so is Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is world? It is not relative to your senses and mind? It is mithya. Minus senses and mind where is the world? How can you call jagat real.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sakshi: that which sees without any means for seeing. You see the mind, you see yourself without any means. Sun illuminates everything else. And shines by itself. You know the world by light and the sun is light. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to say &amp;ldquo;illuminates itself&amp;rdquo;. There is no action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the awareness there is no becoming. There is only mere silent observation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Upadesha is instruction. In jnanam there is only instruction, no handing over. Like there is in religion - handing over a mantra. The one instructing you can call &lt;strong>instructor&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need not instruct nobody to go to a physician when he&amp;rsquo;s ill. But &lt;strong>when the psyche is ill, nobody will even acknowledge that he&amp;rsquo;s sick&lt;/strong>. And when somebody points out that you&amp;rsquo;re sick in the mind, you become angry. Diagnosis: worldliness -&amp;gt; frustration, agitation. The fact that the people become angry shows that they&amp;rsquo;re ill.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Psychological dimension dominates.&lt;/strong> If there is a disorder in this area, your physiological dimension never can become safe and secure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t overdo anything.&lt;/strong> It is a curse. Even for shravanam. When you do, manana and niddidhiasanam are given a go-by.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to lecture yourself. You have to instruct yourself. Look at yourself, look at the mind, and you give a lecture to the mind. That is the &lt;strong>self-instruction. Watch the movement of your mind, be aware of its entire movement&lt;/strong>. Without your effort a silence will enter into you. It is the gateway into the real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnanam - recognising the false as false. You cannot recognise the self. If you recognise it, it becomes the other.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Health - just cessation of roga. Becoming normal. No special benefit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there is a disorder in the subtle, the gross becomes the victim.&lt;/strong> Medicine for the subtle is &lt;strong>dispassion&lt;/strong> (viraga, vayragyam).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to get the dispassion? First viveka, then vayragyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inquire&lt;/strong>. Woman might not inquire. Man should inquire. Why should men inquire. Even woman should have some gold, but not the passion. Passion is wrong. It is developed out of wrong thinking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fever is the trshnah, greed. Intense attachment to sense pleasures. Wealth and pleasure. All the commercials, &lt;strong>advertisements are meant to attract people towards them. To create a sensation in the mind of a person, to occupy the mental space of the people and inject this passion, greed, attachment to pleasures into the mind.&lt;/strong> The defect by which the immunity is compromised is that &lt;strong>the mind wants always more&lt;/strong>. Vulnerability of seeking more. Regarding any sense pleasure: food, money, watching TV etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Close your eyes and notice whether the sense of more is coming again and again. Finally tell yourself you do not need more&lt;/strong>. In fact, you do not need anything. It is the body that needs some food.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To realize your true self you need to have a healthy mind in a healthy body. Body has cancer. Mind has trshna. You satisfy it and comes again back and wants more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvro5r-s78mum">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro5r-s78MuM">Class 2&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The fever of the mind - attachment to the sense pleasures. Intense desires. Medicine - jnana viraga bhesayam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Body is the instrument of action and therefore needs to be put to action. Medicine for it will be physical. Mind is the instrument of cognition. Any irregularity, illness in the mind will be cognitive in nature. Medicine will be cognitive - understanding of what is the self and what is non-self&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>viraga follows naturally from viveka. The combination of these two is the medicine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>What&amp;rsquo;s in it for me?&amp;rdquo; is a fundamentally flawed attitude. You&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to work for a reward. But for the love of the work.&lt;/strong> Reward is anatma and therefore unreal. Your dispassion is in question again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Practice viveka and vairagya just like you breath-in and breath-out. You&amp;rsquo;re not thinking of any reward. This is the very spontaneity and this is also effortless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>trsnah is the abnormal. It is the single source of illness. It will manifest in the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Elimination of illness is the benefit. You remain what you are, normal. There is no positive benefit for any medicine.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identification with the desired object is the infection, the origin of the mental fever.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Sanskrit &amp;ldquo;becoming&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;taking a birth&amp;rdquo; are considered the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Today&amp;rsquo;s morning person is born out of the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s desiring person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Give up the desire for sukhah and you will not know what is dukhah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re the atma, you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the movement of the mind. You&amp;rsquo;ll address, lecture the mind. You&amp;rsquo;re the guru to you. &lt;strong>In identification you&amp;rsquo;re the mind. In disidentification you&amp;rsquo;re the atma.&lt;/strong> Buddha: be a light upon yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdnjv2kt8hpy---center-prisoner-of-space-and-time">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNJV2kt8HPY">Class 3&lt;/a> - center, prisoner of space and time&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Opposite of being aware of your own consciousness (which is not in motion) is not alert. You&amp;rsquo;re identified with the mind. You&amp;rsquo;re one with the flow, you do not have any space with reference to this flow. You&amp;rsquo;re a samsari.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be a witness to the mind. You&amp;rsquo;re looking at the mind. Mind is the other. In doing so you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the mental space in reference to the mind. Now the mental states do not define you. You&amp;rsquo;re aware of them. There is sukha, there is duhka. But you don&amp;rsquo;t become sukhi, you don&amp;rsquo;t become dukhi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the people are followers. Not thinkers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The calamity the mind has created for us is aham and mama.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at yourself. There is a center in you. What is it? A bunch of memories. That is the &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;. It is the result of time. A center has always a space around it. And the space is bounded. As long as there is a center, there is circumference and the bounded space occupied by limited things. You created this prison.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people say I&amp;rsquo;m free. I&amp;rsquo;ve free will. There is no free will separate from the supreme will. It is like the prisoner saying I&amp;rsquo;m free between the prison walls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the concepts outside of his space become extraordinarily important for the prisoner. In spite of acquiring all the concepts (religion, culture, family, etc.) he&amp;rsquo;s still in prison. As long as there is the center there is no freedom. There center always creates space. No matter how big it will be it will be still limited. Prisoner of space and time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do your job. Do everything with tremendous vitality. But you don&amp;rsquo;t need a center for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The moment you&amp;rsquo;re asking for a method you&amp;rsquo;re creating time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Me is the jiva. It creates duality. There is a bigger me called God. Dvaitam is the product of me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at the rising sun with the eyes of the gayatri manta. You&amp;rsquo;ll not experience any division between yourself and the sun. Like looking at the beloved person. There is no me in you. Me vanishes. You the pure being, are just looking at another expression of your self. Without center-me you&amp;rsquo;ll experience a vast space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Me is the complex thing. The real simplicity is looking at things without me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is possible to live in the world without &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sankhyas: posit the individual separate from the mind movement. There is a person called jiva and they called it atma. Atma is many. And then there is the mind moving and the mind is moving for the benefit of atma. First create me out of the movement of the mind and then say the movement of mind is meant for the benefit of this me.&lt;/strong> Mind is moving and creating sukha/dukha benefit for the jiva. All movement of the mind is meant for the multiple jivas called atma too.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfryppkhtoi---mind-as-machine">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfRYppkHtOI">Class 4&lt;/a> - mind as machine&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The only calamity in life is &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; syndrome.&lt;/strong> The first three purushartas are centered around me and mine and they strengthen the syndrome.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sankhya example (wrong): chariot (mind) moves for the benefit of the master (atma). If mind moves the right way, atma gets joy, otherwise suffering. Atma is connected to pleasure and pain, atma becomes the bokta and mind is the karta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Oh silly mind how can you create situations of enjoyment to me, the atma? You don&amp;rsquo;t have sentience, you&amp;rsquo;re jada. You cannot do nothing by itself. Also, atma doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any enjoyment generated by the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is a machine. Mere machine. It has a process, it functions and produces something. The thought process.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind receives the sensations, converts the sensations into experience, then gives a label to the experience and records the experience. Next time the thought comes out of this memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is outside is always fresh and new.&lt;/strong> But the sensation goes into the mind, the mind compares and contrasts and makes it into a repetition. Even when you look at your spouse in the morning, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at her freshly. But the mind makes it a repetition. It converts the present into past. Mind can only be repetitive. It can never have something original. Original comes from something more deep down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is before you is fresh, the sensation is fresh. But mind makes it repetitive. The thought can never be fresh. &lt;strong>Thought is always a response of the memory. Therefore thought can never be creative.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you can never produce anything original (mind), better keep quiet (atma).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Controlled mind (hathayoga) is not a free mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the mind becomes silent, it becomes knowledgable about its own movement. &lt;strong>Quiet mind means freedom from thinking. Why are you sorrowful or excited? Because you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.&lt;/strong> Why are you conflicted? Because the thought produces the conflict.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Freedom from thinking is moksha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your mind is moving slowly, you don&amp;rsquo;t have many thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In jumping from one thought to the other you&amp;rsquo;ve become a victim of memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is creating thoughts. Thought is from the memory, from the past.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When memory is put aside you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing freshness. That brings out the creative being in you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge - pious name given to the memory.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you know your mind, the limits of your mind, you&amp;rsquo;re beyond the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t come across human beings, but across human doings (doctor, teacher, engineer, ..).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does your mediation spring from time or is timeless? Your meditation is also a doing. The real meditation is the essence of life. Is being aware of the mind. There is no phalam for it. It is a merger with the timelessness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx49szimd4uo">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x49szimd4Uo">Class 5&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Be a light unto yourself&amp;rdquo; - Buddha&amp;rsquo;s last advice to his disciples.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generally when people are alone they remain occupied. They indulge in a variety of thoughts.&lt;/strong> Instead try to watch your mind. Very soon, you&amp;rsquo;ll be bored. That means you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with looking at your mind. Therefore &lt;strong>address the mind: &amp;ldquo;mind, I&amp;rsquo;m always contented. I don&amp;rsquo;t care whether you&amp;rsquo;re or not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as you&amp;rsquo;re with the thoughts of the mind. You remain discontented. Fullness you never get by identifying with the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are not contented at all. Moving from one to another. From one relationship to another. From one religion to another. For what? They&amp;rsquo;re all dogmatic. They think, that through such movement of change they will find happiness. Meaning they are unhappy to start with.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change for the sake of change or because you&amp;rsquo;re bored/disenchanted with one thing, or because you&amp;rsquo;re unhappy to start with, will never make you happy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Contentment is true when you remain &lt;strong>without any desire to change&lt;/strong>. If the change happens naturally I&amp;rsquo;m not resisting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The trouble begins with comparing what you have with somebody else&lt;/strong> and therefore you want to change. You&amp;rsquo;d live a life without comparison. First compare, next condemn and then become unhappy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I learn to live with my lot&lt;/strong>. I do not compare, I do not condemn. I desire no change. Any change that happens naturally is OK.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you&amp;rsquo;re not comparing you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the things as they are.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advise the mind to remain healthy by becoming quiet. Desires make the mind dull.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religious-minded persons should be extra careful. Entire religion seems to have one purpose - get you what you seek.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;re speaking of contentment, not speaking of indulgence, laziness.&lt;/strong> Contentment is timelessness. Desire for change is always time. We&amp;rsquo;re not waiting for future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hope is no better than desire as far as creating psychological time is concerned.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a thought or feeling arises, just watch it. Be aware of it. Out of it comes silence. That&amp;rsquo;s meditation! You&amp;rsquo;re not asking, not striving for silence. It naturally happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-6httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyqfinphqina">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqfiNphqInA">Class 6&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This center, &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;, &lt;strong>ego is as much a thought as any other silly thought.&lt;/strong> Any other thought might not have much significance. Pot-thoughts comes and goes. &lt;strong>Whereas the me-thought stays there. Whole life it will be there unless you know yourself correctly,&lt;/strong> unless you realize that this &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; is false. And it will pick up a new body and continue to be there also. Therefore people identify with that &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;. This is the story of the ahamkara and the role of the ahamkara is the bondage of the samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you allow the ego to go, it will go. If you know it as false, it will vanish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When ahamkara is removed by not identifying with it, mind will not stop to function.&lt;/strong> The movement of the mind will be there but it will become impersonal. There are actions, cognition, intellection, thoughts but they are not mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t help you to live in a family, in a society, in a city and practicing a honest profession. They are only a big burden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you learn concepts you&amp;rsquo;re not learning anything. That&amp;rsquo;s why we discuss issues here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Look at your mind. And you&amp;rsquo;ll be abiding as your true self. (Disidentification).&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re never away from it. In every cognition (thought) the light of atma is shining brilliantly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A concept is never the truth.&lt;/strong> Push them aside and in their place create an issue. Cultivate a little impatience to know the truth and settle the issue of atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God creates chronological time, you create psychological time by pursuing your objects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The witness of the mind knows the mind. Do you know the mind or not? Don&amp;rsquo;t try to rationalize too much, that makes a concept out of it. Just grab it and hold to it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hunger is there but it is not mine. Therefore it is not bothering me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rise above the normal identification with hunger and thirst. Don&amp;rsquo;t allow the hunger and thirst to dictate the life to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t drink/eat for enjoyment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not seeking the pleasure is not a stale state, it is the precondition for self-realization. &lt;strong>Every pain is the price for the pleasure you&amp;rsquo;ve sought and enjoyed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-7httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzkepb5wx6s">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkEpB5Wx6s">Class 7&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Oh, mind, please get it. I&amp;rsquo;m naturally beyond the six waves (birth and death of the body, thirst and hunger of prana, pleasure and pain of the mind). I&amp;rsquo;m the essential element. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to create confusion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m the essential element not only of the body mind but also of this universe. I&amp;rsquo;m the reality of the world experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind should be receptive and sensitive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you think in a gross way the world is outside and you&amp;rsquo;re yourself. Look closely, is there a world without a cogniser? Can the world exist without your body? &lt;strong>Did you ever experience the world without experiencing the body as a precondition?&lt;/strong> But you assume the world is the absolute and then speak of a creator&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;re creating a wall between yourself and the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And the body never exists without the mind. &lt;strong>What you call body is simply an idea in the mind.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;ve got it only when you think of the body. And the mind never exists without the consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve got 5 senses and therefore the world is made of 5 objects. There is no 6th object in the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no world without a world experience just as there is no movie without movie experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you call world (jagat) has it&amp;rsquo;s essence in the consciousness (atman). What you call world is what you&amp;rsquo;re projecting out of yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jagat is shabda. The essence of shabda is shabda-jnana. Essense of shabda-jnana is the movement of mind. The movement of the mind is the background consciousness, which is the light of awareness, the absolute atman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We have to learn to see the world as an appearance in the consciousness.&lt;/strong> Think of the dream. Mountain in it is just your consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consciousness doesn&amp;rsquo;t manifest, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t undergo any modification. &lt;strong>Consciousness doesn&amp;rsquo;t become the matter, matter appears in the consciousness. Consciousness appears as matter-consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sorrow and fear do not exist independent of the thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sruti talks of unity. Smrti has divisive thinking as its essence.&lt;/strong> All divisive thinking comes from it. In smrti all the things are real and different from everything else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Window is not the source of light.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smrtis do not sanction love marriage. They sanction marriage organised by the elders within the same cast and all kinds of other conditions. Love marriage is a revolt against all of that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smrti converts the sruti into a dead letter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You perceive a tree because you have the word &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; in your mind and that word is associated with a form. Mind is memory, bundle of past-experiences converted into knowledge. Suppose mind is made to become quiet and doesn&amp;rsquo;t supply the word &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo;. You still perceive and you&amp;rsquo;re the light.&lt;/strong>. Your knowledge of the &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; prevents you from the seeing the right way, seeing the truth of the tree. E.g. if you see a friend or a foo that&amp;rsquo;s the distortion made by the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your consciousness is all-knowing. When you know English, you know it. When you don&amp;rsquo;t know French, you know it too. Never underestimate its (your own) glory as the very ground of cognitions. The consciousness is always flowing through the prison of nama rupa put in place by the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acknowledge you&amp;rsquo;re the boss and not the mind. You command the mind &amp;ldquo;keep quit, I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in your movement in the form of supplying nama rupa in every cognition&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re coloring every cognition with nama rupa. When you try this this is shiva-drsthi. Shambavi mudra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mind always wants to categorize. If it can&amp;rsquo;t, it will be very uneasy. &lt;strong>Let not the mind categorize and there still will be perception. Without categorization the perception cannot disturb you. And somehow strangely you&amp;rsquo;ll see that the perception is no other than you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is the joy that makes your heart innocent. Pursuit of pleasure makes you clever, cunning, egoistic.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: mind, your movement, it&amp;rsquo;s just a waste. Just keep quiet. Your heart opens to that immeasurable. That&amp;rsquo;s meditation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-8httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtk9veq6nada">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9veq6naDA">Class 8&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People are deluded into thinking that the movement of the mind is their essence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prarabda&amp;rsquo;s reach is creating favorable/unfavorable situations in your life. Then ajnana in the form of self-identification with the mind takes over.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you identify with the mind then the changes deeply impact you and you become alternatively sukhi and dukhi. If that identification is snapped, it (changes caused by prarabda) will have no impact you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Oh silly mind, &lt;strong>if only you keep quiet (tvajI prashAnte), divisive thinking vanishes (bedhadhIh nAsti)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Personal. My lungs, my nostrils, my air that I inhale. The personality is entirely product of the mind. And we associate that life-giving process (prana) with me and mine. Tendency is towards division. You&amp;rsquo;re inhaling the same air that the entire humanity is inhaling. You&amp;rsquo;re connected with entire flora and fauna through this process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pay attention to the inhalation and exhalation and understand that they are not connected to the finite (body, mind) but to the life giving air, the universal&lt;/strong>, the infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All division is in the mind (chitta), none in the reality (chit). This recognition is called joga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m a living entity and the whole world is non-living. I&amp;rsquo;m a sentient being wheres the world is insentient. It is dead nature, dead world, dead universe.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All entities, we&amp;rsquo;re all so many bubbles in the ocean of cosmic light. All the objects, all the events are not excluded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wherever there is a sense of division, there is insecurity and fear. And therefore so much agitation in the mind. The moment divisive thinking is gone you&amp;rsquo;ll be free from all that. No more suffering.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t teach divisive identification into the minds of impressionable people.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We stand in identification with the mind and then address the world. Oh world, make me happy. Step back and look at the mind and see.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The witness of the mind is that which knows the mind. If the mind vanishes it is just the mind only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t fall into the trap of trying to control the mind. It is not necessary. Leave it alone and don&amp;rsquo;t waste the inner energy.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;ll not be creating any conflict.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The understanding is powerful enough that without any effort the mind gets purged of impurities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You look at a person&amp;rsquo;s accomplishments and you feel happy about it. That should be the way your mind should move, you feel. No jealousy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The situation is a fact. Not truth, but a fact. Unpleasantness is a projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be the love of a husband. Don&amp;rsquo;t call yourself a husband. The word husband comes with a huge conditioning.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t be the householder, be the love of a householder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Others don&amp;rsquo;t know. That is double ajnana. It is not necessary for the others to know the truth. It is enough so you know. Like in a dream, when you&amp;rsquo;re suffering, all problems are resolved. All others (and their problems) are in your dream.&lt;/strong> No need to assume that because the others are not knowing the truth you need a special way to deal with them. While dealing with others develop a sense of equanimity and harmony. If others are insensitive, which they are more often than not, all you need is titiksha. Endure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consciousness is the content of consciousness. All if the content put together becomes the world. There is no other world. The mind &amp;ldquo;inside&amp;rdquo; is the counterpart of the &amp;ldquo;matter&amp;rdquo; outside and vice-versa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is &amp;ldquo;inside&amp;rdquo; and the world is &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo;. Subject and object division. This is the moha. This moha is the product of the movement of the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the delusion is gone is understand myself as that spontaneous, effortless state of perfect silence. Nameless and formless reality. You might call it God or Brahman. In that there is no division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Division is of two kinds. Benign like seeing different objects of the world. It is required for the transactional thinking. And divisive thinking in which you divide human beings in terms of caste, creed, religion. That is destructive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sakshatkara, direct perception, one&amp;rsquo;s reality doesn&amp;rsquo;t need senses. Perception requires senses. Direct knowing (avagati) doesn&amp;rsquo;t require mind. &lt;strong>Therefore: oh mind, I&amp;rsquo;m not concerned with your movement, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood my true nature.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m not bound.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stepping back and watching the mind requires sattvaguna. In tamoguna you identify with the body, lose all sensitivity and become very dull. Tamas and rajas go together and are the very nature of the mind. You&amp;rsquo;ve to uplift the mind to sattva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you identify when the restlessness gets new energy. You&amp;rsquo;re restless you cannot disidentify. The two elements are just one. Learn the art of contentment and the mind loses its restlessness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is moha. In this creation there is no friend, no foe. There is only divinity. Nobody can hurt you. Only you yourself can hurt yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Moksha is when your consciousness is full of harmony.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re not frustrated/unhappy/hating anybody. You endure some of the undesirable situations and you respond with love to hostility. That is the freedom from bondage, from being locked-up in your mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Know yourself as simple and single. That is the freedom from bondage. I&amp;rsquo;m not old, I&amp;rsquo;m not young. I&amp;rsquo;m neither beautiful, nor ugly&amp;hellip; That is the simplicity. Single - you love entire humanity but you&amp;rsquo;re alone (not lonely).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Really speaking it is the mind that get&amp;rsquo;s caught and get&amp;rsquo;s liberated.&lt;/strong> Atma is never bound.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vikara - as you cognize the situation you&amp;rsquo;re impacted by it. Certain things are painful or pleasant. The moment you declare something painful/pleasant you&amp;rsquo;re impacted. The pleasant and the painful do not exist. In that understanding you lose the vikara and emerge as avikriya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In giving a situation the name &amp;ldquo;pleasant&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve already created the &amp;ldquo;painful&amp;rdquo; situation.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;ll be always caught in the conflict of opposites. Just see facts, don&amp;rsquo;t give names. Maintain equanimity. &lt;strong>Do not name any situation as pleasant or unpleasant.&lt;/strong> When you look at a flower don&amp;rsquo;t call it beautiful, because it will be only a matter of time until you see an ugly. &lt;strong>Become bland, rise above the opposites as pleasant and painful. That &amp;ldquo;blandness&amp;rdquo; is called bliss.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Critical element: participation in the teaching. You allow it to be part of your being. Don&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo; like a tennis match.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sukha and dukha happen only when you anticipate them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper understanding of the whole life. &lt;strong>You divide the life into bits and pieces and decide sukha/dukha for each bit.&lt;/strong> Unless an ignorant mind projects sukha and dukha there cannot be sukha/dukha. Rise above the projection. Things just happen. Sukha and dukha happen around you, in the body, mind. But they never happen to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worldly people just drift. Victims of ever changing society, body, and mind. Carried with total identification with the situation around the body and mind. &lt;strong>Worldy people own up the movement.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I feel very clearly, without an iota of doubt, a distance with reference to the content. I&amp;rsquo;m the knowing element. Nothing can ever happen without me knowing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deep-sleep, waking does not happen to myself. Somehow there is a distance between me and these states.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop titiksha. Begin with sukha. When it comes, be sober, quiet. Accept the sukha gracefully and try to handover it to others.&lt;/strong> Then when dukha comes, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to handle it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;d live in a family like lotus-leaf in murky waters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only love should guide you. First love (in spite of idiosyncrasies and misbehaviour of the others) and then you do what you will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is not necessary that others understand me. The other need not approve me. It is up to them. The others will correct themselves when they want to correct themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation begins when thought comes to an end. When you&amp;rsquo;re aware of what happens in your mind it becomes quiet. When the thought stops creating (sukha, dukha situations).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is like a child. When it falls it cries a bit. It waits for your response. If you pay attention it will cry like crazy.&lt;/strong> If not, it will get up, clear the clothes of dust and continue what it did before.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All illness originates in the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you have to do is not go to the society and start reforming it. Address the mind to keep quiet. Silly mind, why are you doing all this nonsense?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You seem to be the result of your parent&amp;rsquo;s beliefs, habits and fears. You as the person are the result of the past. Of time. Time is the past going through the present to become the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not a traditionalist. I don&amp;rsquo;t belong to any parampara.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you don&amp;rsquo;t see the distinction between an idea and the truth you&amp;rsquo;ll be deprived of the later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negative understanding is the highest understanding. In understanding how you&amp;rsquo;re in the bondage of time the door will open for yourself to step into timelessness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every idea has its origin in the past. All of the past is the raw material out of which you the person is created and sustained.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;I was&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;I will be&amp;rdquo;. Only &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo; has a touch of reality which the other two don&amp;rsquo;t have. And that reality is you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Memory is time. What you see is what is dictated by memory. No surprise life is very dull for us. It is the recycling of the same memory again. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t inspire us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m opposed to time, not to astrology. Because I want to realize myself as timeless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you are performing all kinds of actions with a result in mind, hoping for a better future, you&amp;rsquo;re sacrificing the present, the timelessless at the alter of imagined future.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religions are the past. An organised religion is the frozen thought of the head who lived a long time ago. Truth doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a tradition. Only propaganda has a tradition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m alert to every concept that is likely to catch me in the net of time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drop the past when you encounter a person or a thing. It will appear in a new light, without attachment or enmity. Look at the tree without nama rupa. You as subject won&amp;rsquo;t be there. There will be only observation without an observer. You experience the vastness, newness, freshness, being, awareness, life. There will be no name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Food that you eat you should not make you feel heavy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life should be disciplined and orderly, and healthy body kept by exercise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aditiya Upasana of Rama: &lt;em>Oh Lord, I&amp;rsquo;m about to embark upon the performance of my duty. The battle against this asura (Ravana), that is in me only. For that I need to fight with courage, determination and self-confidence. Oh Aditya, please give me that things! Give me strength and courage to perform my duties happily.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is estimated that 90% of the suffering is mental and the rest physical and not evitable. Mental suffering is needless. &lt;strong>All suffering arises from the psychological time.&lt;/strong> The mind wants to accomplish so many things in the world, which requires effort, which is time. Body is unable to cope with this demands so suffering is created. The past, which is memory, which is mind, which is time, becomes the suffering.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Death is always in the future. When the present is alive and aware there is no death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you understand that death and birth come together you&amp;rsquo;ll not celebrate birthday. You have put death to future and are enthusiastic about the birthday. Death is not in future, death is now. Die to the time, body identification, past, mind, me&amp;hellip; Do that and you&amp;rsquo;re free! &lt;strong>There is freedom in death.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>By putting the death to the future you&amp;rsquo;ve created the fear of death.&lt;/strong> It is a fully. Don&amp;rsquo;t put death to future, put it now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Death is always with reference to something&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practical vedanta vs. armchair philosophy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aliveness, newness of the present moment.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ve taken upon you the life of modifications and they become you and so you&amp;rsquo;re now a victim of time&lt;/strong>. Atma is avikara. &lt;strong>All our suffering is because of modifications.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In doing all the changes happen. In being there is no change, no vikara. You&amp;rsquo;re fundamental essence is &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo;. There is no doing it it, it is only being.&lt;/strong> And in being there is no time. Just be. Do, think, move means time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re timeless and everything else a process. So don&amp;rsquo;t make this cardinal sin of identifying with the process and therefore put yourself in the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The god that I worship is entirely created out of my own estimate of myself. Man creates god in his image and then that god creates the man in his image.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to admit that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know. &amp;ldquo;Destiny&amp;rdquo; is the name for &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;. If you say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; it is innocence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You do not see the mind with mind. You see the mind with your own light. It is the atma that sees the mind in dream. You can repeat that experience in waking state by watching the mind.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re the light. Therefore you&amp;rsquo;re one without the second.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You alone are real (sat), all the mind has collected sums up to zero (asat).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>When you understand it is not accumulation. Binary method (samvada) is for understanding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mithya - it appears, you see it and yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In reality it is not you who sees all the dream objects. It is the dream subject that is created along all the dream objects.&lt;/strong> And that dream subject sees all the dream objects. &lt;strong>If you focus on dream objects it is realism. If you focus on dream subject it is idealism. Truth is neither, both subject and object are created together&lt;/strong>. Truth is the consciousness that transcends the subject-object division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All created by the movement by the mind is unreal -&amp;gt; mind&amp;rsquo;s movement is unreal. Mind is the movement and the movement is the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the entire story only that you&amp;rsquo;ve sen a dram is real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This mind is there when you don&amp;rsquo;t want to find it. &lt;strong>Mind makes you suffer so much. You reverse and try to find it. And you&amp;rsquo;ll only see that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/strong> Mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramana: what you consider the world is merely your conception of the world. Both are equally unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anirvachaniya - that which cannot be categorised as existent or non-existent. Something appearing. The movement of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it appears because of movement it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether you see it or not. Or should I stop it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always (re-)pay the service to forefathers. After sanyasa at least mother idea should be retained.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In sleep, the person (aham), the world and the god is not there. Vedanta is about the inner most reality, not about god etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The known (world) depends on the knower (aham). And when you look at the vastness of the world, you&amp;rsquo;re obliged to bring about the god.&lt;/strong> If creator is in the beginning than the creator is yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You know what you know and you know what you don&amp;rsquo;t know (Chinese). Therefore you&amp;rsquo;re sarvajnah, just like the creator in the beginning.&lt;/strong> This is Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People prefer conceptual Vedanta, where brahman is the creator. And sampradaya, systems become more important. &lt;strong>When there is a vision, a system has no value.&lt;/strong> It can be in its place, we don&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention on that. In Vedanta the focus is on you. The teaching helps you to discover your vastness, to which we give the name brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhashyakara very appropriately named the Brahma Sutra as sharIrakam shastram. The one that is obtained in this body mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The way to remove misconceptions is to inquire, study, investigate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The truth, the real cannot be measured. Cannot be captured. Drsh (view, sight - držať).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In idealism they give priority to the drashta. In realism they give reality to the drshya. I don&amp;rsquo;t fit in any category because both are interdependent only. They are appearances and the &lt;strong>reality is one, present in darshanam, drstha, drashyam (immanent), but really speaking it is beyond all three (transcendent).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Duality as an experience is not contested. It&amp;rsquo;s a fact, not truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If guru and parampara is what sustains you then there is no advantage in joining Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The dream experience is with you all the time. But you never looked at it closely. &lt;strong>The knower rises with the known and the known rises with the knower.&lt;/strong> Waking up is simply negating the dream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seer is unreal -&amp;gt; Shunyavada. Seer&amp;rsquo;s essential nature is Brahma -&amp;gt; Vedanta. Seer is uncertain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Seeing is the truth. What you see is unreal. That you see is real.&lt;/strong> You can get this conclusion from the dream experience also. &lt;strong>All that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen incl. the subject is unreal, but that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a dream is real. Out of that seeing springs up a seer supposedly within and seen supposedly without. What you call &amp;ldquo;seer&amp;rdquo;, the me, the person is but a thought. What you call &amp;ldquo;seen&amp;rdquo; is also an idea in the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a world experienced by you only when you&amp;rsquo;re a body/mind identified person. Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re not a body/mind identified person, like in deep sleep, then there is no world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the mind is perfectly still, there is no waking state anymore.&lt;/strong> The drastha, drshyam, darshanam triad has come to and end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The knowingness alone is real. In that knowingness the triad alone appears and disappears. The knower and known are added by the mind. Knowing alone with being is your true nature.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re angry with a person. The adversary is the known / unreal. The angry person, the ego, is also unreal. The atma caitanya which illuminates this interaction is the real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is your delusion, because you&amp;rsquo;re imagining things. Mind is imperfect. All you need to do is to purify the mind so it stops identifying with the persona created by the mind&amp;rsquo;s movement and relegates its oneness with the light of awareness / atma. That mind is the maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maya doesn&amp;rsquo;t have antecedents. Maya is not false because of something else, it just is false. Everything else is false due to maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is maya satya or mithya? I do not want to answer this question. What appears due to maya is mithya. What remains after negation is satya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Motion is critical. &lt;strong>Without motion you won&amp;rsquo;t see multiplicity.&lt;/strong> Something is moving, creating a sense of division. The movement which is the mind creates the experience of subject object duality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Utilitarian (what&amp;rsquo;s in for me) approach comes from wordliness. In Vedanta we do not look at the utility of understanding the truth. It has its own value. I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in benefits accruing to me from knowing the truth. I just speak the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What you call &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; is nothing but tree-consciousness.&lt;/strong> There is no thief but a thief-consciousness. All is myself. All that exists is myself. All appearances are in me only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avasthu yoga: the division has no intrinsic reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shakti is one power. The power to emerge as rupa jnanam and shabda jnanam are the same.&lt;/strong> Within you, the knower, there is no division in rupa, rasa, ghanda etc. That kind of outcome division doesn&amp;rsquo;t create a division in the origin (shakti). Extrapolate to multiple knowers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-16httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvd-8qovsfijm">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-8qovSFiJM">Class 16&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Once you negate the world the limitations of conciousness also get negated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jagat is known to the knower through a means of knowing. The means of knowing is mithya and the status of the knower (knowership) is also mihtya. The division is mithya, only the light of awareness in which this subject-object division shines is real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you assume yourself to be the drastha (knower) you assume yourself to be standing away from that brahman.&lt;/strong> Once the drahstrtavm is negated, you do not stand apart anymore and merge into the light of awareness that alone is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If jivas are many, what about Ishvara? Sankya: you don&amp;rsquo;t need Ishvara. Believer needs Isvhara, he&amp;rsquo;s the inner need. It&amp;rsquo;s like a child, it holds on to mother. Advaita: the one atma is Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If atmas are many -&amp;gt; atmas are limited -&amp;gt; atmas undergo transformations -&amp;gt; atmas go extinct -&amp;gt; shunyavada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Existence of the world: you need a conscious being to have the appearance of the jagat.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever you take yourself as the inner light, you&amp;rsquo;ll never experience the multiplicity, division. It&amp;rsquo;s not about experiencing some kind of exotic oneness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Why the mind is doing the mistake identifying with separate existence? Because it is imperfect. Because it is crude (tamoguna) and restless (rajoguna), thus lacks viveka and identifies with the body.&lt;/strong> Therefore, purify the mind, make it calm and sensitive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world that the ajnani sees is not the same as the world that the jnani sees. The way people concretise - identify with the nama rupa, is the problem. &lt;strong>Learn to take the nama rupa lightly, dismiss them. As long as you hold on to nama rupa you remain a body identified person and are far from the truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Where there is no projection of fear or desire, there is no ego also.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not going to experience the infinite. The approach is rather negative. You&amp;rsquo;d look at the particularization of yourself and give it up. Dismiss all kind of projections or mental forms which divide you, make you feel small and limited. Overcome fragmentary thinking - dvaita buddhi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you stop the categorization you&amp;rsquo;ll instinctively feel the oneness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-17httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv8jc_pxdwxg">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Jc_Pxdwxg">Class 17&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>North and south pole are opposites, but they are not opposed. They are together in the same magnetic field. The differences do not separate. There are opposites but there is not opposition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The divide and to particularize is the nature of the mind. &lt;strong>If you give free run the mind it will divide, divide and divide.&lt;/strong> Separation is against the truth. Nature is one. Reality is one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anything which is limited in space is invariably limited in time also. Dualist conveniently avoid any mention of space and time. Why? Because they give a form to god. Doing so you&amp;rsquo;re doing an injustice to the whole vision. You&amp;rsquo;re putting beginning and end to the god. Therefore atma cannot be many.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The ego is precipitated or is posited in the consciousness whenever there is a desire. The desire or fear or all-is-not-well sense belong to it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Person is the same as ago. They are not two different things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upasana requires duality. But only take that much duality that is needed for it. Don&amp;rsquo;t take it too far. Duality is admitted only provisionally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emotionalism and sentimentality are not true devotions. They are traps.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The expressions of jnana are infinite.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is the journey from the small self to the infinite big self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m prior to the mind (-&amp;gt; time). I&amp;rsquo;m prior to the perception, inference, scriptural instruction. I&amp;rsquo;m prior to the body (-&amp;gt; space). I&amp;rsquo;m prior to the world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Before you rise a doubt whether atma is real or not, I&amp;rsquo;m already there. You cannot say I&amp;rsquo;m unreal. I (atma) can declare you&amp;rsquo;re unreal (mind). Projections alone can be unreal. Divisions are projects. It cannot be but your imaginations, your projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I can never ever be false. Generally what you negate is many and unreal. What remains is one and cannot be negated.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>the very existence is associated with diversity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowadays Buddhism has become like puranic Hinduism. Full of forms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The dialogue between the sunyavadi and atmavadi is the very proof for existence. You cannot have any such deliberation about sunya. If atma were like the horn of a rabbit there would be no such deliberation about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever mind projects is unreal. Now the mind will say even the atma is unreal. Now atma is saying to the mind &amp;ldquo;oh mind, you cannot say that&amp;rdquo;. Even before you rise to say anything, I&amp;rsquo;m there. Just like a son cannot you the father doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can never ever be unaware of yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Doubt comes only when the mind is active.&lt;/strong> But you&amp;rsquo;re there no matter what. When you find yourself in doubt, just pass.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is the thought that breeds sorrow, conflict, fear. Hold your ground, tell yourself: You&amp;rsquo;re prior to the thought.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To make a projection the mind has to spring up, a thought has to be in place.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowing is the mechanical process that is performed by the mind. The mind which is but a thought. It is the thought which knows and a thought is a mechanical movement and out of this movement knowledge happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you&amp;rsquo;re thoughtless, you&amp;rsquo;re aware you&amp;rsquo;re the pure knowingness in which there is no knowingness of any particular thing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The magnet doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the iron fillings move. When the magnet is present, they move. The world shines in the presence of the sun. The sun doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the world shine. Sun is and shines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Act of knowing belongs to the domain of the mind, not atma. Atma doesn&amp;rsquo;t guide the mind (e.g. say &amp;ldquo;have good thoughts&amp;rdquo;). Mind is guided by its own latencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever is known by the mind has two qualities. It is divisive, therefore dualistic and it is unreal.&lt;/strong> Therefore atma is unknown and unknowable by the mind. This very fact proves atma is real (because whatever is known to the mind is unreal).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Writing the exam and passing the exam is one integrated action. The mistake happens that we take the action which is in the present and split it. Make one part of the action in the present and one in the future (result). That is kamya karma. If you pray before the exam to write the exam well that is not kamya karma (but duty-based action). If I pray to give a good class and get dakshina that is kamya karma (desire-based action).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The glow is the sat and the glow that you see is asat. What you see is unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We have to admit the real. You cannot say shunyam is the element from which it all comes.&lt;/strong> Because it is shunyam, it is void. Nothing comes out of nothing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The glow cannot be shunya because we&amp;rsquo;re deliberating on it.&lt;/strong> Same logic apply to multiplicity also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If the duality is taken as real then the original real will become unreal. The real cannot be two, it can be only one.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever the mind projects is unreal. But the unreal looks real. Just appearance alone should not push you into any wrong conclusions. Check, whether it is time-bound or not. Whether it is transient or not. &lt;strong>When it is real it cannot be transient.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upanishads are not theological, not dogmatic, not stories. Upanishads are entirely doctrinal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yat nityam tad eva satyam. Cardinal principle of Shankara. Whatever is timeless is real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you believe in it, the appearance is taken as real.&lt;/strong> If you doubt it (raise questions about it) the &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; vanishes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transiency is best proof of unreality. Whatever is limited in time is limited in space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it is unreal, then there is no need to deliberate upon it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In spite of the appearance of the unreal, the real is not affected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What you call outside is very much inside the mind only.&lt;/strong> It is the movement of the mind itself that creates this schism that you call outside/inside. Jagat is apparently outside the body but is inside the mind. What you call jagat is movement of mind only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t be carried away by usefulness and TX. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You have a commitment to make the world real. If not entirely, at least partially you&amp;rsquo;ve invested your emotions in the world and you want it to be real. If not as real as brahman, at least 50:50. That&amp;rsquo;s why you miss the point.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world is a projection of the mind entirely built on memory and imaginations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is the nature of the mind to imagine goals and strive for those. And therefore there are goals which are very &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goal, desire, fulfilling the desire, reaching the goal, striving for the goal. These are all states of the mind. The real is beyond the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>It is always the human mind that wants to know the purpose. If you minus the human mind you can remove the word &amp;lsquo;purpose&amp;rsquo; from the dictionary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Truth doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve any purpose whereas untruth does serve multiple purposes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Student should always seek the truth without ever without ever asking about it&amp;rsquo;s purpose.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The purpose belongs to the realm of unreal. Don&amp;rsquo;t you ever bring this argument (of purpose) to truth. Purpose -&amp;gt; holding to unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your dualistic sat (god) is good as asat. It serves a purpose.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not serving a purpose doesn&amp;rsquo;t establish unreality.&lt;/strong> You imagine purpose with your mind, your own thinking, based on your own latencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What do you want to gain by learning Vedanta? It helps you examine the reality of your experiences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Realization of the self doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve any purpose what-so-ever. There are no rewards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are more credulous than thinking. Nobody has the inner space to examine the vision very closely.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Maya - movement in the motionless Brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The movement is characterized by space and time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maya - space time continuum. Continuum is when there are two things you cannot separate. And the space time continuum directly gives rise to variety, multiplicity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Truth is always one. Real is always one. The multiplicity that you experience is a product of maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without consciousness there is no error. Wall, pot etc. don&amp;rsquo;t make the error.&lt;/strong> The appearance of the serpent is possible only because there is the background of consciousness upholding that appearance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you see in the rope will depend on your vasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The system created by the guru is an extension of his ego.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You go to a movie and sleep off. During that sleep there will be no movie (for you). For somebody else it will be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;d ask when did the world begin. You&amp;rsquo;d ask &lt;strong>when did my world experience begin?&lt;/strong> World began 12 millions year ago. The 12 millions year ago are in your head only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where did this world experience begin? This morning. Where? In my consciousness. Prior of that what were you? The pure light of awareness. Prior the onset of the multiplicity there was the real. And you&amp;rsquo;re the real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All knowledge is nescience.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you get out of struggle is nescience. What you get spontaneously is the truth. self-realization is not a knowledge. You&amp;rsquo;re what you&amp;rsquo;re for no particular reason.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re what you are not because of what you know you&amp;rsquo;re. There is no knowing involved in it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowledge implies the knower and the known.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>neti neti. It is enough to know what you&amp;rsquo;re not. You need not, you cannot know what you&amp;rsquo;re.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re non-particular. You&amp;rsquo;re non-somebody, you&amp;rsquo;re non-something.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Negative understanding is the highest understanding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Vedanta is study of the real. Science is study of the forms. Vedanta begins where science ends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Child has no mind and it gradually acquires it. Mind is a collection of ideas acquired from the family, society &amp;hellip; and then putting the things together the mind comes with its own projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever idea about the real can only be a projection. Knowing the self is not possible. If the self is known it becomes the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Svasamvedhyatvam - knowing oneself by oneself. There is no such thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How? There is no how. Atma is. The real is which is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no need to know the being. It is not possible either. Because the being itself is the knowing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do you want to know yourself, sir? Then just be yourself! It is enough to stop imagining oneself to be this or that.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By knowing what you&amp;rsquo;re not you&amp;rsquo;re free that. I&amp;rsquo;m not the riches. I&amp;rsquo;m poor neither.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The truth is always bitter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The richman is one who is slave to his riches.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clever swami wanting to rest: &amp;ldquo;I will answer all questions that are not based on ID with body mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By identification with what you&amp;rsquo;re not you&amp;rsquo;re not in your natural state.In this natural state this expectation to know what I&amp;rsquo;m will vanish. You&amp;rsquo;ll leave the abnormal, excited, feverish state of a worldly person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma is avishesha (vishesha - quality, label, specialty, property). Atma is not something. Don&amp;rsquo;t say nothing. You&amp;rsquo;ve a fixed idea that you&amp;rsquo;ve to be something&amp;hellip; No label apply to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sanjasi feels proud that he belongs to the dashanami (bharati, saraswati &amp;hellip;). That&amp;rsquo;s what binds you. No, you&amp;rsquo;re avisesha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love the family members. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to label yourself as a family person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;You are&amp;rdquo; is same as &amp;ldquo;you know&amp;rdquo;. They are not two different things. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; is the same as &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s enough to know what you&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge is always a description. Description of what? Of what is already known. Perceptually, conceptually or inferentially.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you&amp;rsquo;re cannot be described except as total negation. Neti neti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As you can point as this or that it cannot be yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Can you be something else? How can you be something else? You can only be yourself. If you can&amp;rsquo;t be something else, how can you say I&amp;rsquo;m this or I&amp;rsquo;m that?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember, without you there cannot be no perception, no conception. Whatever is perceived or conceived, you&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The proof of the pudding is in it&amp;rsquo;s eating. Taste the freedom that comes of the scissor neti-neti. Live it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What helps you to know yourself correctly that is sadhana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To know oneself correctly, to realize oneself correctly rather, is bliss, freedom, ananda, love, emancipation. Not knowing oneself correctly and taking up superimpositions is sorrow, bondage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The family has to look on you as a family person. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to look at yourself as a family person. Don&amp;rsquo;t imagine anything about yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation: engaging the mind with something that is known to you (mantra, image &amp;hellip;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishnu has four hands. Gives four kinds of help (help ~ &amp;ldquo;give me a hand&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Not accepting atma (yourself) as being distinct from body mind, no amount of study will have no effect. You have to reach beyond verbal expression.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body and mind are shields (koshas). They shield the atma. They cover.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body is the doing element. Mind is the thinking element (subtle doing). Go deeper. To the knowing element.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma is the light of awareness, the ground, base in which the mind is thinking and organ of speech communicating this thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shunyavadis subscribe to four elements. Akasha is void, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Birth - was it an experience registered by the mind? Therefore I cannot tell about myself that I was born.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;d question it. You&amp;rsquo;re inferring that you&amp;rsquo;re born. People are telling that you&amp;rsquo;re born. Shastra is telling you&amp;rsquo;re not born. What do you take? Don&amp;rsquo;t follow anything. Take the clue from everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Follower sounds like you&amp;rsquo;re not very great. Belief doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound very good. Tradition is a better name. Parampara. You remain a follower and call yourself traditionalist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birth is an idea. Same for death. &lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t have the experience of death, just experience some people dying.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The power that created the body takes care of the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ultimate good is not there in indestructible body, extended life, this and that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is whole is also holistic, holy. It is the opposite of fragmented.&lt;/strong> Go above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love your enemy. It means there is no enemy. How to do it? By love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The illness of the body originates in the mind. See the ignorance of the fragmentation and get over it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is no fragmentation in you as &amp;ldquo;myself&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;not myself&amp;rdquo; then the sadhana chatusthaya will come to you very smoothly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spirit of crucifixion is the negation of the body. That&amp;rsquo;s what Buddha and Krishna teach about.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In spite of some good points commonly held in some &lt;strong>schools of thought&lt;/strong> some basic fundamental blemishes in some of the schools need to be pointed out and refuted so that they won&amp;rsquo;t take root in us.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>System: there will be a central figure and a few structures are built around it. You submit yourself to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no connection between Radha Krishna and Gita Krishna whatsoever.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When your mind is active, you&amp;rsquo;re not understanding. You&amp;rsquo;re collecting.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Understanding is not additive, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t accumulate. In learning, there is no accumulation, no addition.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suffering caused by misconception about oneself cannot be eliminated by accumulating knowledge. For that you need to understand your misconception.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Vedanta there is only one devata. Atma. People want the word devaha, the divine, somewhere away and separate from them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You who was born is imagined (kalpita). You who was not born is akalpita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re anxious to learn, you&amp;rsquo;re never anxious to learn.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Street dogs can be very dangerous, mango is very tasty &amp;hellip; is that accumulation? No. &lt;strong>You learn by inquiry&lt;/strong>. Inquiry is a job to be done by you, in you, for you. Submitting to something called vedanta is not inquiry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re always free from death, birth, &amp;hellip;. by your very nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Anybody who claims to be a jnani and others are ajnanis is ajnani himself.&lt;/strong> Mahatma says none of us were born and will die. Our nature is like that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The imagined comes only after the thought (movement) begins.&lt;/strong> After the thought begins it is real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Look at yourself. You&amp;rsquo;re not an imagination.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideas like birth and death only appear when the thought begins. Before thought there is no time itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without movement there is no time. Therefore thought is encased in time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thought is fragmentary, thought divides. Prior to thought there is no division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thinkers vs. yes-sayers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Maya: you&amp;rsquo;re aware of body/mind but unsure of atma. Which is the only thing you&amp;rsquo;d be sure of.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot question that which is prior to the thought. It is as real, as tough as a diamond.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look into your thought process which is the thought process. Consciousness is defined here as the content of consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t understand the power of your desire. It will mold your life and the one thereafter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You want to uplift the world. Learn instead. Don&amp;rsquo;t teach. Keep quiet. You cause trouble for this and next life for the person you teach. If you have to teach, teach there is no birth, death, old age for you. You&amp;rsquo;re brahman, you&amp;rsquo;re atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you believe you can do it. If you believe you can&amp;rsquo;t, you can&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s all in your mind. If you say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a very unlucky person&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll become very unlucky.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Atma is not taking birth as dvaitam. Dvaitam is not taking birth from atma. Like ropesnake. That&amp;rsquo;s the topic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Duality does not really exist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before you can settle birth or not birth, atma must be there. To make the mistake about ropesnake, there must be some light. And to fix the mistake, you also need light. The knowing element must always be there. Either to say there is birth or to say there is no birth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara is struggling a lot to dismiss the birth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mother remains the mother and the child is born. What kind of &amp;ldquo;born&amp;rdquo; it is?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dvaita is only appearing, it is not taking birth at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless you resolve this contradiction (birth impossible for atma) you&amp;rsquo;ll pay a very bitter price. Develop that space in reference to body and mind. You&amp;rsquo;re never born, you&amp;rsquo;ll never die. Discover your immortality here and now.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Accumulation of knowledge is easier than learning. You&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ajaatavada: you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a serpent birth alright, but the serpent was not born.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Assumption of birth makes you live with the fear of death.&lt;/strong> Birth and death that&amp;rsquo;s what all religions are about.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Body and mind are always together. Psychology and physiology are always together. It is the dvaitam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If it is born, it must be real. If not and it is a mere appearance, it must be unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Realization - purging the consciousness of false notion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Idea is never the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instead of saying &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re following of a frozen thought&amp;rdquo; we prefer tho nice name &amp;ldquo;tradition&amp;rdquo;. There is no updating, no thinking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Eliminate all the structures and systems that you&amp;rsquo;ve put in place to reinforce the notion of birth&lt;/strong>. Therefore in your consciousness the idea of birth should not even occur. It&amp;rsquo;s only required for the CV.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to say &amp;ldquo;shubham&amp;rdquo; when death occurs. Death has no meaning for you. The only sentiment about it is that you have to dispose off the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You mind find the functions of the body declining naturally, but you don&amp;rsquo;t feel the burden of being impatient and old guy. You&amp;rsquo;re immortal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once the idea of birth is purged the idea of old age and death will be purged automatically.&lt;/strong> Something like katrtvam is gone by itself when bhoktrtvam is dismissed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is nothing to do, there is only to un-do, un-learn.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Padapuja is an attempt to fill the gap until love and understanding comes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dvaitins fight against each other by demolishing the others argument and therefore bring up the ajatavada. And we embrace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma: job done properly. Not successfully/unsuccessfully. Such a job will bear karmaphalam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jumping from sat to asat (death) and vice versa (birth) is not acceptable. Pair of sat and asat remain distinct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can say about yourself only this much &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo;. Whatever you add to it (the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; of I&amp;rsquo;m), all of it, is false. The &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; of I&amp;rsquo;m is false. This is the shortest path to self-realization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo;, any &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; to I&amp;rsquo;m is false. How to take things personally? You can only laugh.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who so ever comes here to do namaskar is a hindu. But people believe the most absurd things based on the birth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do you live by life or do you live by memory&lt;/strong> (it&amp;rsquo;s my 75th birthday)? We live by memory and act by habits.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First get hold of &lt;strong>ajah&lt;/strong> and then you&amp;rsquo;ll get everything else.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>All the problems that we live with all the live are merely the problems of the body. If you realize that you&amp;rsquo;re not the body all the problems are gone for you. Yet &lt;strong>superficial thinking won&amp;rsquo;t help here.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You created systems which bind you into a tunnel, narrow groove and you cannot come out of that groove.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Abhyupagama: when you&amp;rsquo;re not understanding what I&amp;rsquo;m not saying I go along with what you think. Instead of having a debate with you and trying to convince you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not connected with you (and your movement, one of which is the birth) silly mind - asangatah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you really grow up, you&amp;rsquo;d put the body aside. Like soldiers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One should outgrow the body and body based early in life (30&amp;rsquo;s or 40&amp;rsquo;s) so you can dedicate the rest of the live to self-realization. Instead we accumulate knowledge about self-realization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sastra says that the soldiers who puts his body out of the way on the battlefields and a jnani who puts his body away in understanding of the true self both reach brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The one who knows (looks at) the mind is the witness of the mind. You cannot explain more than that. The witness is known to you because you&amp;rsquo;re the witness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being the witness is same as knowing the movement of the mind and the body. Being the witness helps you to know what you&amp;rsquo;re not. You become free from false ideas and false desires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You need not know what you&amp;rsquo;re. E.g. when you&amp;rsquo;re healthy, you&amp;rsquo;ll not know that you&amp;rsquo;re healthy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the mind is restless you don&amp;rsquo;t worry. Let it be restless. You (witness) have no connection with that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot and need not control the smoke (mind) coming out of the incense stick (body). Let it be in peace. You&amp;rsquo;re the glow (light).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>See, you need not close the eyes. But see without raga dvesha, which is the movement of the mind&lt;/strong> - your associations. &lt;strong>BE ALERT, BE AWARE OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE MIND. DON&amp;rsquo;T IDENTIFY WITH THE MIND.&lt;/strong> The mind comes with a response to what is heard/seen &amp;hellip; a reaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re hurt whatever you do is a reaction and that will show you in a poor light. If you don&amp;rsquo;t identify you won&amp;rsquo;t be hurt. And you can say &amp;ldquo;sir, you&amp;rsquo;ve got it all wrong. Have a good day&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Unless there is self-identification with the mind, you won&amp;rsquo;t be hurt.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is nothing worth keeping in this world. There is nothing worth worrying about if you lose it in this world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;rdquo; approach. If the mind wants to have raga dvesha, let it have. I&amp;rsquo;m kutastah.&lt;/strong> With self-ID you only reinforce raga dvesha.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Paper -&amp;gt; cone. &lt;strong>Whatever is born by speech is merely name (nAmadheyam).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birth of the pot is merely birth of the pot thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(kutastah) Atma: oh mind, by your movement creating all kinds of opposites, I do not gain anything, I do not lose anything. I do not get glorified by your projection of glory. &lt;strong>The gain/loss/glory are born from non-existence.&lt;/strong> They do not exist even, are not really born.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve lost nothing. You&amp;rsquo;re just imagining. Understand this and there will be tremendous freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsaris are always concerned with loss and gain. It is not real, it is attachment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Animals bring up the offspring and then forget about them. With humans, there is a tremendous concern.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When jealousy is asserting there cannot be any love, there can only be attachment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sometimes &lt;strong>you&amp;rsquo;re attached to your ideas and you want to impose these ideas&lt;/strong> on your children. You&amp;rsquo;re pushing the other to adopt the ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trying to dominate the other, &lt;strong>is that love?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Abiding in that purna atma, that includes all, where there is no loss, no gain - that is love. Everything else is a projection of the mind, attachment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There cannot a connect (yoga) between atma and manah. Atma is changeless, timeless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In this creation nothing is connected to anything else.&lt;/strong> Get this vision of non-attachment in you. Whenever you feel that you&amp;rsquo;re attached you&amp;rsquo;re under the influence of drug called ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whenever you make it sentimental, you lose the truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People think that they are attached to the real. They are not. They are the real. They are attached to the unreal - name rupa.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rich man is the man who&amp;rsquo;s attached to the riches.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn to work without seeking an advantage to the apparent self. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn to rise above it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The real self is not a person. This real self is the same in every human being, like one sun reflecting in a billion dewdrops. Even in animal and in all mineral kingdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Overcome attachment to get to the real self.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the secret.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spiritual maturity: not holding to anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you do not cling, no trouble arises&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Relinquish the outer the get the inner, the false to get the real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is non-attachment, life becomes an inexhaustible source of inspiration and love for everybody.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All &lt;strong>attachment implies fear, because all things are transient.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhagavan is nameless and formless. Disregard all names and forms. Now you&amp;rsquo;re an universal person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upanishads and Gita don&amp;rsquo;t offer theistic god. It&amp;rsquo;s a different god and cannot be described in words.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;I need an apparent self to transact in the self&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;re giving some sanctity to the apparent self. It&amp;rsquo;s like saying: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a teacher because I need to be a teacher to teach&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I need not be the teacher for the teaching to happen. When you identify with the doing, you become the doer and then you become the person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you sishya or are you brahma? The purpose of the teaching is to make you known as brahma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People know themselves through something else. But what are you as yourself? Not by a reference to a lady (husband) or what you do (engineer)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The god that you talk about, is he a created god or not?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is memory and memory is the past. Other name for memory is the known.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By defining you limit a thing. If it is limited it is unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To find the thing you need to go beyond the word. &amp;ldquo;Mango mango mango&amp;rdquo; or the real thing?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The words, the symbols have become more important that the search for reality. &lt;strong>Is not the symbol an escape from the real? A fanciful distraction from the real?&lt;/strong> The symbols, the ceremony, the festivities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the true religion is not the question. What is not the true religion is the question.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To know the truth you need a very &lt;strong>simple mind. Not a conditioned mind. Not a mind full of descriptions, words, names, rituals.&lt;/strong> A mind having an agenda for everybody around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the content of the religion I hold on to? I suggest words and words only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t want to think and we don&amp;rsquo;t want to find out. That is our problem. We want some sensation, some stimulation in name of fanciful distraction. To think is very painful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beyond the words is the creative reality which is the atma.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Feeling is deeper than thinking. &lt;strong>Do you feel like ishvara is none other than you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mental worship - there is no physical worship in the upanishads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sun shines only one time in your life. The first time. It never stops.&lt;/strong> Do you look at the sun as the sun from yesterday and day before etc. or do you look at it the very first time! Sun is ever fresh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No repetition!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tradition is meant to be followed, not examined.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you fail to meet the moment with freshness it becomes repetitive. Mind loves the repetition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you do things mechanically you become dull.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It must inspire you, it is only a matter of paying attention.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is the memory that creates time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make the &lt;strong>transition from time to timelessness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind moves or not moves. Whereas atma timelessly shines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Understanding can never ever be in the future&lt;/strong>. If it is there, it is in the present only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re thinking, you&amp;rsquo;re in time. When you&amp;rsquo;re watchful, alert, you&amp;rsquo;re out of the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is no time you&amp;rsquo;re no more jiva. You&amp;rsquo;re brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not a shape. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re the knowing element - that which makes perception, thinking, knowing, inference etc. possible.&lt;/strong> Knowing is the primary. Hands and legs will do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accumulative means you&amp;rsquo;ll lose it. Non-accumulative you&amp;rsquo;ll never lose.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The atma is sama. Non-different. You&amp;rsquo;ve to reach that and that&amp;rsquo;s the purpose of Vedanta. Sukhi vs. dukhi is a topic for karmakanda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combining karma and jnana is a cardinal sin. Shankara used every opportunity to tell you this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Belief is like a tram car.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a driver and goes always in the same groove. Belief is like that. Fully mechanical. Generally robots are made of metal, this robot is made of flesh of bones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is not like a tram car. Life is new, fresh, every day, every hour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you &lt;strong>heal your mind your body will be healed automatically. It is a single organism!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All sishyas go to guru for security and develop psychological dependence. And it is mutual. No. &lt;strong>Go to guru to receive instructions and then move on.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t linger around the guru. Be inside but don&amp;rsquo;t become an insider.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t seek security/happiness (from wife, student, son, god). Give security/happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever person you are imagining to be, get rid of it by knowledge. The person is the construct of ignorance. There is only psycho-physical apparatus. There is life. There is atma chaitanyam. There is no person. When you&amp;rsquo;re not a person why do you make a person out of god?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The fact that you know it makes it limited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can you have a god without a devotee? No.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you say you know brahman you become superior to it.&lt;/strong> Now brahman is not superior anymore, but you&amp;rsquo;re supreme. You made it a small, limited thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You mine information like you mine chemicals. &lt;strong>Knowing is a mechanical process&lt;/strong>. There is stimulus outside, light falls on the retina, sound waves fall in the eardrums and then braincells start filling&amp;hellip; When you go to sleep this mechanical process is stopped.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All cognition is recognition. &lt;strong>Unless you know it already, you do not know it now.&lt;/strong> There is a SW in the mind and that kicks in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re the knower, the pot is the known, in between is the mechanical process of knowing. Whatever is known through it is a concept.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Man first creates the god in his image and proclaims god created the man in his image. It is an &lt;strong>anthropomorphic (anthropo - how a community thinks, morph - form) god&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Only he who knows that God is the unknowable knows God. Though unknown and unknowable it is supremely accessible (as your self).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot get out of this humanness easily. You don&amp;rsquo;t make a god a fish, you make it a human with a fish head. That is the god conceived by the human mind. Not the real god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Understanding, now knowing&lt;/strong>. If you go to google guru you&amp;rsquo;ll know, but not understand. Having known from the google guru, when you contemplate upon it, then you might understand. &lt;strong>When the mind is active, there is only knowing, no understanding. When there is understanding, your mind is quiet.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you&amp;rsquo;re thinking, you do not understand. When you understand, you are not thinking&lt;/strong>. In the understanding the sense organs become quiet. They are not forced to become quiet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot stop the mind from thinking&lt;/strong>. Try and you&amp;rsquo;ll be frustrated in two minutes. The mind can stop thinking. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to command and control. Just live it alone and be in your awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your silence is not created by the thought. It is the silence that is prior to the very idea of silence. If you&amp;rsquo;re there in the silence you become a disturbance to the silence. You can be that silence, you can access it by merging into it, you cannot know that silence. The moment you try to understand it you&amp;rsquo;ve already lost it. That is the brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>World: Don&amp;rsquo;t disturb the situation. Don&amp;rsquo;t look closely.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look closely, only then you can access the reality in yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you don&amp;rsquo;t know god, search for god in sentient, not in the insentient.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thought cannot capture the reality, cannot objectify the real. Whatever it captures is unreal. &lt;strong>Therefore don&amp;rsquo;t rely on though to help you reach god. Same for sabda, sparsha, rupa, rasa, gandha.&lt;/strong> Suka, duhka is thought. Drop those seven and you&amp;rsquo;re already in brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhaktas rely upon thought to take them to god. You have to think god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Srsthi is rajoguna. Sthiti is sattvaguna and destruction, death is tamoguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shiva is god without any gunas. Shiva is brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami Vivekandanda: if somebody kicks you, you don&amp;rsquo;t react. No ID with the body. Jesus Christ: when somebody slaps you on the left cheek, show him the other one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m aware of the insult but I don&amp;rsquo;t get insulted&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The god you want to reach is aguna. So you have to become aguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is sattva, body is tamoguna, in between life is rajoguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Give up ID with the tamoguna by being active purposefully. You give up ID with the rajoguna by giving up all the desire for the results of your activities. You give up sattvaguna by not ID with the mind, intellect, scholarship etc&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Symbols, rituals, festivals, idols are divisive.&lt;/strong> Not inclusive. They divide the (Hindu) society. That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason why other religions have become powerful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(religious Hindu context) &lt;strong>You should not do any fundraisers.&lt;/strong> You should avoid all efforts to make money. You&amp;rsquo;d be able to manage with whatever money comes without your effort. Shivananda Maharaj: serve, but don&amp;rsquo;t ask for money. No need to collect money. Manage with what you have. Do your job and funds will come.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Ramakrishna mission you never come across any fundraisers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You only need a fundraiser if you have an agenda to put onto people.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Translation of &amp;ldquo;dvaita&amp;rdquo; into english - division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body/mind is gunas, atma is aguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is always easy to follow and always difficult to think. Creative thinking is difficult.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family, community will love you if you are docile, believing and following. There is a beautiful name for believing and following - tradition. Or you listen to whosoever says something. And then you think.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All the confusion has its origin in that &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;, which is direct product of self-identification.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How we handle external threats? There are no threats. Be free. Look at squirrels, do they look for external threats? Ask the question, what is the state of mind?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pleasure doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a learning opportunity. Generally people learn only from pain.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma is not the locus of any experience.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s why mahatmas are advised (if they take to sanyasa): don&amp;rsquo;t try enjoy bikshas and all that. If you start enjoying the biksha it means you&amp;rsquo;re identifying with the experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience is not the issue. Identification is. You like/dislike and you forget the experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a &lt;strong>name for non-identification - death while living.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do not identify with studentship.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Moksha you need not get it. It will get at you provided you give it a chance.&lt;/strong> It is you. How? Let go your attachment to the unreal. Then the real will smoothly step into its own.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The complaint regarding work comes from a sense of doership. The delusion is I&amp;rsquo;m rewarded less and doing more. Reward yourself by knowing your true nature.&lt;/strong> Then there will be no frustration whatsoever. Do but don&amp;rsquo;t become a doer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No identification born out of being and out of doing. And the truth will dawn upon you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need not decorate anything. Everything is lovable the way it is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True religion, in which there is no scope for any fear. If there is fear, there is no true religion. Religions of the world are entirely based on the fear. &lt;strong>In true religion, there is freedom. You remain stable inwardly and the outward events cannot touch you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you have fear, you cannot think.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you become stuck with a tune/song you will not be able to listen to anything new. Openness to listen to anything new will not be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should be ready to catch anything fresh. This is what is called non-attachment from ideas, beliefs, patterns of thinking. &lt;strong>Be entirely open.&lt;/strong>, all the delusions of the mind will be wiped out.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>self-identification is another name for attachment. If you can handle the self-ID, you&amp;rsquo;ll become free of the samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no difference in the universality aspect of prana and atma. The only difference is that prana is saguna and atma nirguna. Prana related is upasana, atma related is jnanam. It is highly recommended for all students of Vedanta to worship/visualize the god of life force in oneself and all lifeforms - pranaupasana.&lt;/strong> For more information read Chandogya Upanishad, 5th dhyaya last part - vaishvAnaravidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rshis never had any temples. When the universal upasanas haven taken a backseats, temples came. Mostly from 1000 AD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Somebody is abusing you by speech. The life-force behind this organ speech is god, even though the speech is bad only. Overlook it and you&amp;rsquo;ll have no enemy in this world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hiranyagarbhoupasana - popular name for vaishvAnaravidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attachment to the things made of the hand. Instead of having 3-4 shirts, you&amp;rsquo;ll have 30-40. Gold, jewelry etc. That&amp;rsquo;s the only bondage really speaking. If you continue with this after listening to Vedanta, with old ways of thinking, living and acting, the graha remains in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You have to look for your-self. It is not about promoting this culture or protecting this darma. All of that you&amp;rsquo;re just imagining. You have to find out for yourself how to look at the problem of human existence&lt;/strong>. Cultivate a lifestyle where all this turmoil and misery comes to an end. That will happen only when there is no fragmentation in your life. The moment you identify with something, the fragmentation will be in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there is a reason to persist in your heart, it will persist. Graha will remain. You&amp;rsquo;ll not come out of the fragmentation. When the belief vanishes graha cannot survive. The ID, obsessive attachment vanishes. The fire burns as long as you put fuel into it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand that we&amp;rsquo;re all the same. Rise above fragmentary thinking and the graha vanishes. For practical reasons there might be differences, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The liberation is not contained in a particular experience. &amp;ldquo;When kundalini comes to the head it becomes the liberation&amp;rdquo; - yoga gurus put wrong ideas into the minds of devotees. Any experience induced by drugs etc. is no liberation, however glorious the experience might be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The meaning of shanti is dousing the fire. Agnihi (of samsara, of wordliness, of graha - self-ID) becomes extinct. The fire came in the first place from wrong ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is nothing positive about liberation. Liberation is from false ideas only.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Understanding deprives the attachment&lt;/strong> which therefore vanishes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People have connected religion with big structures, rituals, ceremonies, animals, loads of flowers, gold&amp;hellip; Break that connection by clarity of understanding. And you&amp;rsquo;ll step out of the false religion, the religion of the masses into true religion which liberates you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once the understanding comes the division between worldly and spiritual life vanishes. The clarity of vision sets you free.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Vedanta is worth studying a lifetime. At least 10 years don&amp;rsquo;t talk (teach), study and study. Swami TV: I was studying Vedanta for not less than 20 years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anybody who has only one guru, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t learn anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re in learning mode, a river, a child anything can be your guru. Therefore namo gurubyah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recommended parts of Upadeshasahasri, Swami TV already taught:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>manovilApah (vilApah - merger).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>karma vs. jnanam in the very beginning of Upadeshasahasri&lt;/li>
&lt;li>beginning of the gadya (prose). CDs available in Rshikesh ashram.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meditation is not (should not) be isolation. Is it your love for ekanta (alones) or are you isolating yourself?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Battle with the mind is wrong. Meditation is not starting and winning a battle with the mind. It will put a lot of conflict in you and you&amp;rsquo;ll never win it.&lt;/strong> How can that be meditation?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pursue of a vision. Vision is a play of the mind. Mind wishes for a vision and then mind manufactures the vision for itself. Mind is the stage and mind is the player.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is samadhana! Not being a victim of your sense-organs. Meditation is even as you&amp;rsquo;re relishing the thing, you&amp;rsquo;re so alert and so sensitive that the alarm rings. You&amp;rsquo;re aware of the movement of your mind - that&amp;rsquo;s meditation. Be aware! Even while speaking you&amp;rsquo;re aware.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is not an isolated effort. It&amp;rsquo;s an integral part of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meditation is not doing. It will have no phalam, don&amp;rsquo;t look for it - that will introduce time into it and is no more meditation.&lt;/strong> It is being. Don&amp;rsquo;t make meditation into another job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Swamiji did I disturb you?&amp;rdquo; No, I&amp;rsquo;m never disturbed. &lt;strong>You never disturb me. I&amp;rsquo;m awake - I&amp;rsquo;m not disturbed.&lt;/strong> If you get the meditation correctly you&amp;rsquo;re not disturbed by anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rshis didn&amp;rsquo;t need temples. For them the image of god was all-around.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s how they visualize.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>The right way to listen to a speaker is to set aside your knowledge.&lt;/strong> Knowledge - accumulation. You neither agree nor disagree with the speaker. The idea is to think about it and that is how we learn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of meditations can be classified as fancy or imaginations. Sometimes this fancy or imaginations acquires a status of tradition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Law of repetition: whenever there is repetition it is bound to become a cult. Then it blunts the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is meditation a practice or state of consciousness into which the mind comes very smoothly and abides in that? Effort -&amp;gt; karma -&amp;gt; karma phalam&amp;hellip; True meditation is effortlessness itself. That requires &lt;strong>huge sensitivity&lt;/strong>. When you&amp;rsquo;re attentive there are no thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Effort brings in the element of time. &lt;strong>Anything where time comes in will bind you.&lt;/strong> Real freedom - time is not involved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Inner) &lt;strong>simplicity in life&lt;/strong>. A mind free from ambition, competition, scheming&amp;hellip; A mind which believes it has achieved is not a simple, humble mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Repetition is when there is memory.&lt;/strong> Memory converts experience into repetition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddha was the first teacher of vedanta. Walking all his life. Giving one lecture in the morning and one in the evening.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is fear only because you seek pleasure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there is fear, there is cruelty.&lt;/strong> Like sacrificing an animal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A heart filled with fear can&amp;rsquo;t know what is love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pleasure, fear, cruelty is hallmark of ritualism. This is what Buddha dismissed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-1">Class 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meditation is state of consciousness where there the ideas of effort and reward are not present. There is only attention, that does not exclude anything.&lt;/strong> Attention of what is. It liberates and transforms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I do not do meditation, I come into meditation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:vakya - sentence. In this case &amp;ldquo;tat tvam asi&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:vrtti - function. Function of the sentence (tat tvam asi).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Primary meaning vs. secondary meaning (lakshanah).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you know your self, you&amp;rsquo;ve known God. There is no other way of knowing God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it comes to jnana section of the Veda, primary meaning is put aside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Masses - always wanting something or the other. Undisciplined. With a collective consciousness of fear and want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People find it difficult to be humble because they have a sense of achievement.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you learn you&amp;rsquo;re not a follower any more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Abheda garbha namaskara: I&amp;rsquo;m praying to a god who is within me and non-different from myself. Vimala bodhakanam namami.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anything 100% like sugar, salt is called &lt;strong>crystal - ghana. Homogeneous. Monolithic.&lt;/strong> Here ghana of knowledge (boddha) of the self. Knowingness in which there is no knowing. Knowing this or knowing that is already contamination.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The bigger it includes the bigger but the lesser doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the bigger.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is not a prayer from periphery to the center. This is the prayer where the center explodes and merges in the whole.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Out of my own knowledge I create, I sustain in my own knowledge and I take it back when I go to sleep. You sustain a city - that is the power of human thought. You can understand the infinite power of brahman only when you look at your own power. Acintya zakyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can create illness for you, you can cure your own illness if the doctor cannot cure. The lord who created all commands all. &lt;strong>You created a world for yourself and you command it. Nobody can make you miserable except yourself.&lt;/strong> Now, am I describing the brahman or am I describing you?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman also makes mess. He created dharma and adhmara. Hell and heaven. Hero and the villain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The moment you create a form you made a form you become a sect. People who hold on to one particular form are divisive, sectarian and not in sync with the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ananta murti: in reality brahman has infinite forms. You are also one form. Even silly gold can have infinite forms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Two options: either hold on to all the forms or embrace the formless. Both are the same.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bondage briefly: general sense of sorrow and fear. Idea like presently not all is well with me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lack of want - foundation for complete sense of well being. Freedom. Settlement. Sometimes sorrow might come, but it will also go.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When children are playing, they&amp;rsquo;re in bliss. When you watch them, they stop playing and become shy. There is bliss in you but somehow you&amp;rsquo;re an obstacle to what is in you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You need a mirror&lt;/strong> to see your self, &lt;strong>to enjoy your self. For brahman, the mirror is the maya shakti called shrI. One loves the image in the mirror. The image in the mirror is different yet not different from herself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Duty. In the language of Gita: svakarma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The being is first and foremost in you, then only elsewhere.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do your study with all the love and enthusiasm. In doing so, you&amp;rsquo;re worshiping Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True religion vs. religion of the masses. Vedantic religion vs. popular religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami: I never liked the philosophy that a person is unhappy today because in his childhood his parents have done something to him. This has become a big psychological law. Maybe actions were wrong here and there. But the intent was clean.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever happened in the past, put it aside. Live in the present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you accept on person as a guru that day your learning has come to an end.&lt;/strong> From who so ever we learn, he&amp;rsquo;s the guru.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The right (outer) guru is the one who takes you to the inner guru. Gurus of the world don&amp;rsquo;t tell you the truth. They maintain the disease so you are patient year after year.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All is myself. My diamond ring - it is not carbon anymore, it is myself. &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m projecting myself outside and relating to it as though it is other than myself.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m the only reality in this entire creation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:prasada = benediction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I care to understand the all-pervading Vishnu is in me and not different from me. Aham eva vishnuh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>God made you or we made god? There is no god other than godliness.&lt;/strong> God sounds like a person. Convert god into impersonal. The god you&amp;rsquo;re worshiping is not outside but in you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>River is a projection. Bank is a projection. It is prthivi. You give names and believe they are real. &lt;strong>Everything is a projection. The one who projects is real.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The guru is the one who shows the way back home which is your real self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahatma has clarity of thinking. He&amp;rsquo;s not confused. He sees/understands things as they are. Entire world is confused. People see things as they imagine. Jeweler sees gold, people see ornaments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To think of god you have to experience some insufficiency or deficiency in you. You have to think of yourself as limited as small.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Vedic vision god is impersonal. Puranic people have converted it into personal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; you always feel separation. When you say godliness the separation is not so strong. What you call jiva is a bundle of desires and fears. As that you&amp;rsquo;re separate from God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Satguru is the guru who takes your attention to the (inner) guru in you. Satguru is the adma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow the mind to be silent and you&amp;rsquo;ll experience pure consciousness. Once the mind projects the body you&amp;rsquo;re the body. Once it projects the riches you&amp;rsquo;re the rich man. Once it projects the gender, you&amp;rsquo;re a man/woman. If it projects nothing, you&amp;rsquo;re the pure light of consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tapatraya. Worldly life throws three challenges on us. Nobody is exempt. Tapas - suffering, intense discomfort (associated with intense heat). 1) physical. Body is sick in all kinds of ways 2) elements around us 3) gods. Sending unseen enemies like corona virus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:arca - blazing sun.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is full of conflicts among humans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entertainment is an industry. There is so much boredom in lives of people. Shut it down and people will go crazy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody seems to know the meaning of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are caught in self-centered activity of ambition, competition and status seeking. People want to achieve something all the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re caught in our own thoughts all the time. People can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Superstitions. In popular religion people can&amp;rsquo;t tell the difference between superstition and facts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Routine of habit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Psychological dependence upon faith, religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re dependent there is fear. Fear and psychological dependence go together. When there is fear, there is conflict.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tourism. Celebrations. You&amp;rsquo;re escaping from yourself. One of the biggest escapes is religion. In the mean-time old age comes. It comes much sooner than we expect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everybody is looking for a leader. People want to follow. Followers will destroy the leader and the leader will destroy the followers. That is not the way to escape samsara. A spiritual leader should encourage learning, not worshipping.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to equip yourself with shama (mind), dama (body functions). So you can be with yourself for a length of time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re a good student you&amp;rsquo;ll find a good guru. &lt;strong>A good guru is one who has no agenda for you.&lt;/strong> He&amp;rsquo;s not looking for some reward. &lt;strong>He&amp;rsquo;s the one who is encouraging you to discover the truth in yourself by yourself.&lt;/strong> One who points to the inner guru, atma - be a light unto yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Total attention is when the mind becomes entirely quiet. Then you experience yourself as he pure consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>sa:bhagavAn - one who&amp;rsquo;s revered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is enough to revere the teacher, you need not worship him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bondage we&amp;rsquo;re talking of is bhava bandhana. bhava - worldliness. You don&amp;rsquo;t need thrills. They will destroy people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether you&amp;rsquo;re sick or healthy. Cycle of pleasure and pain is a problem. Worldly people get accustomed to this problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is so much effort from the people to grab a piece of happiness.&lt;/strong> It shows that we&amp;rsquo;re very unhappy. That&amp;rsquo;s bhava bandana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose I don&amp;rsquo;t seek any happiness what so ever. That is freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Effortlessness doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you sit in a corner and rot.&lt;/strong> If life is sedentary, you&amp;rsquo;ll become sick. That is not Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People believe sadhana means intense effort. Effort determines the outcome elsewhere. Not here. How much effort should you put in to get good sleep?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The more punishing, the more reward. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re carrying a huge stone on the head. Stop carrying it. That&amp;rsquo;s vayragyam.&lt;/strong> Raga is opposite of vayragyam which is freedom. And vayragyam is effortless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dialogue is very characteristic for Vedanta. Everywhere else you&amp;rsquo;re learning about something that is not you. Meaning of a dialogue, a student going to a teacher, is about learning life and oneself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddha: nobody can hurt you. Only you yourself can hurt you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maturity: he he&amp;rsquo;s had successes and failures, he&amp;rsquo;s been exhausted by karmas. He wants something that is effortless now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three states of the mind: distracted, concentrated and alert.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You work and work and work you feel tired. Happily. &lt;strong>Physical fatigue is very good for health. Whereas emotional fatigue is very bad for health. Intellectual fatigue is very good for health.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Concentrated mind is recommended by the hathayoga people. &lt;strong>Concentration of the mind is the punishment. The problem is exclusion.&lt;/strong> It demands tremendous energy, makes you conflicted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In alertness (sAvadhAna) nothing is excluded. It makes you healthy. It is your true nature. There is no effort involved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Clarity of though: No way silly emotion will come into it. No personal prejudices have a role to play.&lt;/strong> In Vedanta no way the clarity of thought should be compromised.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sri Krishna uses more the word &amp;ldquo;seeing&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;knowing&amp;rdquo;. The one who knows Niagara doesn&amp;rsquo;t know Niagara. The one who sees Niagara now knows the Niagara. We&amp;rsquo;re 2nd hand people, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what is 1st hand. All our religion is 2nd hand. There is nothing experiential in it. Idam tad iti - this is that! Direct perception. Apperception.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose I realize I need not seek happiness from the world. It cannot and need not give any happiness to me. That is freedom.&lt;/strong> That is 1st hand knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generally people only quote others. That is 2nd hand knowledge. If I quote from the reverence, but the knowledge is mine, that&amp;rsquo;s 1st hand knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;re looking for emancipation, not redemption.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can jnanam have a reward? Karma will give you a reward. But emancipation is not the outcome of an effort.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you are grieving. You&amp;rsquo;re grieving because of a misapprehension. You go to a mahatma and he shows a mirror to you: Look at yourself! You&amp;rsquo;re holding to a false notion. Suppose the person understands - the grief is gone. Grief is there only because of false notion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study of nyaya (indian logic), or other dualistic philosophies, doesn&amp;rsquo;t help in understanding advaita vedanta at all. Vedanta is neither divisive nor logic. It is oneness and love. Rather than studying nyaya make some money, enjoy life and come to Gita and get liberated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvc9vtix1y3m4">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9vTIX1y3M4">Class 5&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rdquo; is relevant when something is a process. You&amp;rsquo;re not a process. You&amp;rsquo;re yourself without any respect to place and time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m with my self, the world is completely shut off. The world experience comes to a grinding halt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is nothing short of a miracle that I sustain the world (which is the world experience) in myself. So much so I can stop it. Just by being with myself. Simply I am. I alone am.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I can put aside the world-experience at will or I can bless the world-experience to continue. I&amp;rsquo;m the master of it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only rarely somebody wants the freedom from worldliness. People are interested in artha, kama and then dharma (for reaching other worlds). Heaven is a copy of this world, just more refined.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you gain this knowledge but you do not realize it, it just remains conceptual knowledge, slowly it becomes poison. You get false notion that you&amp;rsquo;re a vedantin.&lt;/strong> And then you may consider yourself as a teacher of Vedanta. &lt;strong>The process of learning has abruptly come to an end.&lt;/strong> Poison: this kind of knowledge makes a person egoic, arrogant, hottie. Jnanam: something you understand first hand, within yourself. You know it yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Tat tvam asi&amp;rdquo; can do it. What you want to be you already are. This simple and practical it is. Teacher cannot do it for you. You have to give it a chance. You&amp;rsquo;re free from sorrow. Otherwise I cannot help you with your sorrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is very legitimate to do whatever it takes to be happy. The happiness you&amp;rsquo;re seeking you already are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The moment you say supreme power, God, Ishvara a schism is created. It sounds like it is other than you. If you say paramatma, supreme-self&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong> God is God in the clouds. Paramatma is ocean. To experience water, to which part of the ocean you have to go? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever difference you feel/perceive/conceive between the supreme self and you is the essence of ignorance.&lt;/strong> It only shows that you do not know the glory of your own self. This is the story of &lt;strong>Hanuman. He&amp;rsquo;s to leap across the ocean. The thing is he can, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know that he can.&lt;/strong> But Jambavan knew.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schism between what you imagine yourself to be presently: crying, begging, unhappy living entity and what you are: supreme self, embodiment of happiness. You&amp;rsquo;ve to cross that division. That&amp;rsquo;s leap across the ocean. That journey is not in space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tadatmya&lt;/strong> - oneness. That is this and this is that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Somebody wanted heaven (or hell). The kingdom of heaven is within you. You can create both.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re under the kalpavrksha - wield yielding tree - with the name of tatvamasi. It is in you. You want to be unhappy? -&amp;gt; You become unhappy. You feel you&amp;rsquo;re old? -&amp;gt; Then you&amp;rsquo;re old. Oh my legs don&amp;rsquo;t cooperate too much -&amp;gt; they don&amp;rsquo;t. I can learn! -&amp;gt; you can learn. I will make everybody happy -&amp;gt; you make everybody happy. Tatvamasi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tat - that understanding = idam - this direct perception. tadatmya vishayam jnanam, tat idam mukti sadhanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The moment you recognise the folly it goes away. You&amp;rsquo;ve to discover the inner fullness. Every soul is potentially divine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The scripture tells you to go and do the puja only if you believe to be the doer. The scripture says don&amp;rsquo;t do bad things because you&amp;rsquo;ll get papa. The scripture doesn&amp;rsquo;t say you&amp;rsquo;re the doer. You say you&amp;rsquo;re the doer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t connect the higher and lower paradigms. Only when you&amp;rsquo;re a doer, you&amp;rsquo;re responsible for the outcome of the action. For the higher, there is no action, no doer, no result, nothing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Body fits into the medical science only when it is &amp;ldquo;the body&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;my body&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can you come out of the &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; syndrome?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world is not real because it is limited and it will perish. The real is unlimited. Brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proverb in Telugu: &amp;ldquo;The goat always believes the butcher&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speech is the link between the thought and action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In entire Phoenix, &lt;strong>can you find a person who is not in search of something or the other?&lt;/strong> And all that search is in vain. When you do not yourself, your search is in vain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can there be life without relationships? No.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without knowing myself properly, there cannot be any meaningful relationship.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowing oneself is not opposed to relationship, not opposed to the society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You do not need what you think you need.&lt;/strong> You need only to know yourself. Nothing else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If somebody is talking very complex things, he&amp;rsquo;s not talking the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To believe is very easy, to look at oneself requires tremendous sensitivity. Keep healthy mind in healthy body then you&amp;rsquo;ll have it to examine the issues of life.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>we&amp;rsquo;re trained to be isolated persons. &lt;strong>The person comes from the thought process&lt;/strong> - conditioning of the mind. Minus the mind there is no person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Comedy helps to &lt;strong>drop the person&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The so called &amp;ldquo;secret things&amp;rdquo; I collect and make a person out of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t find &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; and the sorrow separately. The sorrow/fear/dissatisfaction itself is the &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The conflict itself is the person.&lt;/strong> When the person is negated, the conflict is gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In religious context you always say &amp;ldquo;aham&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;mama&amp;rdquo;. The person is there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Objectify the body, watch the body. Similarly objectify that person, the ego. That takes you to the spirit. This is the foundation of &amp;ldquo;sakshi bhava&amp;rdquo; - being the witness of the person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If there is some conflict be a sakshi to that conflict and see what happens with it. That takes you out of the &lt;strong>psychological dimension, which is a prison, not your home.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>citti samjnana -&amp;gt; cit (ending &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rdquo; is an marker)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Table is not solid. It is 99.99% void / space. &amp;ldquo;Solid&amp;rdquo; you get by the impression of the touch. Body is not a thing, it is an idea in the mind. Bhagavan buddha said: &amp;ldquo;body is a wave&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You have a body only when you think of a body. That is the foundation of the anesthesia.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If body is not the thing what is the thing? Caitanyam&lt;/strong> is the thing, it is what is. Like in a movie, all you see is not a thing. Light is the thing, nothing else. Everything else is phenomenological.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look for what is. That is how the search for the truth goes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ll not be able to appreciate ananda, as long as you seek pleasure. You&amp;rsquo;ll not the joy of good health as long as you eat spicy and tasty food.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shanti - subsiding, dousing (of the mind). Shanti = ananda = true joy != pleasure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vigraha - matrix. The stuff which the appearing is made from. The essence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kim na prapatyase - why don&amp;rsquo;t you realise/understand?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The person, along with all its problems, is a phantom. Phantasmagoria. To understand that you need to have a quiet mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christ: &amp;ldquo;when somebody slaps you on the right cheek, show him the left one&amp;rdquo;. Means that &lt;strong>his home is not the hurt body mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>3 levels: matter, energy, intelligence - the spirit. You&amp;rsquo;ve to look at yourself correctly. Otherwise whole life becomes a punishment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is nothing like missing anything.&lt;/strong> Mahatmas who know anything are like wind, they come in and they go out. No identification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whenever you notice you&amp;rsquo;re getting annoyed, tell yourself you&amp;rsquo;re chitananda shivoham.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Best service you can do to the society is take away one ignorant guy from the society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How long you feel I&amp;rsquo;m a punjabi as long you&amp;rsquo;ll say I&amp;rsquo;m satchitananda. Did I ever tell you the village I was born? I do not identify with space. Did I ever tell you my age, birthday? I did not identify with time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose I feel &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m swami TV&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s only a name. What is there in a name?&lt;/strong> The rose smells as sweet even when you call it by any other name (Shakespeare).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m the witness to the ever changing moods of the mind (time) and states of the body (space)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A mask is intrinsically a piece of cloth with two strings attached. It is not (intrinsically) a mask.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body is not flesh. Feet until loins - prthivi. Abdomen - apah. Tummy - fireplace. Chest - vayu. Neck and above - space. You&amp;rsquo;re not the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What do you get out of the discovery that you&amp;rsquo;re not the body? Nothing positive. But great freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Business guy is money-conscious. Soccer player is goal-concious. While cooking you&amp;rsquo;re conscious of the dish &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>most of the time you&amp;rsquo;re not body conscious. You&amp;rsquo;ve to overcome the residual body-identity.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;ve to dismantle structures which promote body identity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot control the body. That is not in your hand. But you can stop identifying with the body -&amp;gt; feeling of lightness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Normally &lt;strong>people live a living of craving and fear. Because we&amp;rsquo;re identified with the body.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pot half filled with water is the same as the body. A bunch of panca-bhutas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Physician treats the body, not the person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do not identify so much with the body as with the attributes of the body: age, gender etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;d be able to say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; only then your mind is open.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If Vedanta becomes conceptual it just becomes another kind of religion. Only nomenclature changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stay with it for a time, contact a physician by all means, but don&amp;rsquo;t battle the illness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In life you have to ask the question: &lt;strong>did you put some goal in-front of you and you&amp;rsquo;re running to it so it can be put behind you?&lt;/strong> That is insanity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repeat any number of times: I&amp;rsquo;m not the body, I&amp;rsquo;m the one who knows the body. You have to deal with the body-identification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implication of never being born is never going to die.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it comes to self-knowledge, cheating doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t you ever make a big issue out of birth and death. There is nothing like birthday.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Space is freedom. Develop inner space.&lt;/strong> Begin with the body. &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Body is ill&amp;rdquo; - there is space. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m ill&amp;rdquo;- there is no space.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t need as much outer space as you believe. Leo Tolstoy: you need 6 feet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you have an inkling that you&amp;rsquo;re not the body that is the intimation of the infinite. That is self-knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge is always in the present. Never in the future.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t make a goal out of the self to be reached in the future. You&amp;rsquo;re the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gravitation is space (akasha) -&amp;gt; kinetic energy (vayu) -&amp;gt; heat / radiation -&amp;gt; water / electricity -&amp;gt; magnetism (prthivi). In gravitation there is only attraction, no opposites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>String theory - everything is only space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing is not effort, doing is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pot is the seeing. I&amp;rsquo;m the seer. Pot has a shape. I have no shape. Pot was born and will die. I the seer was never born and am never going to die. Pot is insentient, &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m sentient - I know myself and also the pot. Where the pot doesn&amp;rsquo;t know itself and anything else&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahatma being sick: today you can ask only questions where there is no body identification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>See, what are all the areas, where the body ID is ruling, recognize it and dismantle them. Suppose I&amp;rsquo;m putting color to my hair - that is body Id.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the spirit and the matter interact, the matter doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave any residue in the spirit and the spirit doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave any residue in the matter&lt;/strong>. Conduct yourself as you&amp;rsquo;re not the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jesus of Nazareth became Christ only after crucification. You have to crucify yourself. What is the crucification? Realise I&amp;rsquo;m not the body. How? &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t act on behalf of the body.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vasudeva acarya: you&amp;rsquo;re accusing the annamaya, the body, not me. I&amp;rsquo;m not the food body. What are you? Take seat and I will tell you in the class.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>The one alone not seeking happiness is happy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you walking or are you aware of walking? By practising the walking meditation you&amp;rsquo;ll realize yourself as the witness of walking. Same for speech meditation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is the teaching. But you do not feel like a teacher, you do not look at yourself as a teacher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as you entertain the sense of doership your mind will be disturbed under stress. &lt;strong>The day you realize you&amp;rsquo;re not the doer you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered timeless peace of mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re seeing a plant -&amp;gt; you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the seeing. Like an optometrist looking at your seeing of the letters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You not only hear (ID with the function) but also you know that you&amp;rsquo;re hearing (dis-ID).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Close the eyes. The eyes are not seeing any forms but you know you&amp;rsquo;re seeing. I see that the eyes do not see now. That is what you are. Not just a mere function of eyes. You&amp;rsquo;re the eye of the eyes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The way to do it is to &lt;strong>stop with the ID habit&lt;/strong>, which is in the worldly people - readily identifying with every - and anything. No mine, no me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not identifying -&amp;gt; humility. Identification -&amp;gt; arrogance, egoism.&lt;/strong> Not pretended humility -&amp;gt; truth shines -&amp;gt; everybody loves you. When you&amp;rsquo;re humble, there is freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Looking at the lighted cellphone screen makes the mind very agitated, restless, blunted and dull. In the old-age you&amp;rsquo;ll have neurological issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nature never forgives, nature never respects personalities.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn to engage the intellect in productive use. Use it or lose it, never identifying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind like glass appears to be self-shining. C&amp;rsquo;mon, glass doesn&amp;rsquo;t shine. It only appears so because it is transparent. It is the sun that shines. Mind is so subtle and so close to the atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spirit - source of knowingness. That is shining. Mind is so close that it appears to be shining by itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot stand yourself if you cannot be with yourself. How do you think others will stand you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be alone and look at the mind, see what&amp;rsquo;s going on. Some chatter, seeking is going on all the time. Do it and you&amp;rsquo;ll not be bothered. Suddenly minds gets quiet. Instead of watching the mind I became one with the mind that&amp;rsquo;s why it is going somewhere and you become alert - ID has broken.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Silence and spaciousness go together. Thought has bounds. Silence has no bounds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are two things taken wrongly as love by people. Lust (attachment) and cupidity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Difference (by inference) between a cadaver a living person is prana. Somebody says I want to live longer - ID with prana. Essence of non-ID with prana - vipashyana meditation of Buddha - watching the breath. You realise yourself as the witness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Witness is not a person. The identifier is a person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is an emotion. Sit down, close the eyes if necessary and step back - watch the emotion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because of the misfortune alone you have so many clients for the astrologers, numerologist, there are so many crowds in the temple, ashrams&amp;hellip; No misfortune -&amp;gt; swamis will not have any sisyas with them. But people present a facade in-front of the sorrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People learn only from misfortune. Great poets come from sorrow. A poet and a philosopher know the sorrow and have digested it. Normal people can&amp;rsquo;t and suffer. Befriend the sorrow. Step back and watch it. Use it to your advantage. Sorrow -&amp;gt; metamorphosis (-&amp;gt; wisdom/poetry).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Watch the jealousy and don&amp;rsquo;t identify with it. It will get digested.&lt;/strong> Establish yourself as the witness. Emotionalism (ID with mind) has no value.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loving, quit, wise, understanding but not emotional. That is where you reach by not ID with the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you know the non-self as the non-self you become free from the non-self.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhagavan creates human beings. Who created the son? Son creates the father (drsti-srsti vada, for advanced students). Not father creates the son (srsti-drsti vada, for beginners). &lt;strong>Child is the father of the man.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ajata vada - zenith of the wisdom. No creation. Mandukya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children - bundles of rajoguna. &lt;strong>When people are given to a lot of rajoguna, give karmakanda to them. They don&amp;rsquo;t deserve atmajnanam. When they are saturated with the world, give them atmajnanam.&lt;/strong> There is a place for everything in the scheme of things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The parents want their children to hold to their values so in adulthood they follow their way of live. It is a mechanism to dominate and possess the children.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children have to be terrestrials, play in the mud, not celestials.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Meditation: if you keep the posture from memory, it becomes something which you repeat. When the posture is fresh, it is not a practice, because there is no time in it. &lt;strong>Time is memory&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you repeat the posture, you create the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is memory. Mind is the parasite. Mind is the knowledge in terms of accumulation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind becoming silent is the same as dropping the memory.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paradox: the answer has to come from the mind which is knowledge, past, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Here is a question without answer: &amp;ldquo;Who am I&amp;rdquo;? &lt;strong>The seeking of answers is the past-time of the mind.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t allow the mind to intervene.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you the present or are you the past? People are the past history walking around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Astrologist are the bluff-masters. They tell you something about the past and sell is as future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tomorrow is Monday? That is past (no matter what day)! &lt;strong>Whatever mind projects and gives the label &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo; is also past.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is present. Living is past. People know only the living. Wake up and don&amp;rsquo;t allow the past to be flooding. Tat tvam asi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you don&amp;rsquo;t give names all you see is brahman. Sarvam khalvidam brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be loving, don&amp;rsquo;t be emotional (mind).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you don&amp;rsquo;t admit a thing called assembly in addition to its parts, the word &amp;ldquo;part&amp;rdquo; has no meaning. Vedantins and bauddhas do not admit assembly.&lt;/strong> Implication: there is nothing like body distinct from individual parts. And you can&amp;rsquo;t call them call parts either.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge as accumulation binds you&lt;/strong>. Village guy who did not accumulate knowledge is free like wind. Philosophers don&amp;rsquo;t look at the body as a separate thing in its own right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pancha bhutas are material things. Not the body. It is an idea in the mind. There is body only when you think of the body. Basis for anesthesiology.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice generous indifference about the assembly, dis-ID with it. &lt;strong>When you give status you make it real.&lt;/strong> It is a phenomenon - appearance in the flow of time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wherever you are interested, that will bind you.&lt;/strong> Suppose you walk to a shop and get interested. You become customer and consumer. A small wheel in the giant wheel of consumerism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wise man moves around the trees not taking himself for one. Same for body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sun is, other than is, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform anything.&lt;/strong> Whereas the living beings function all time. Time is there only when there is movement (therefore function). Sun is timelessly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pot is unreal. Real is already occupied by clay. When you touch &amp;ldquo;pot&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;re touching clay. What you smell, taste is clay&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong> The real! When you weight it: 100g clay, 0g pot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Illusion can be based on similarity: snake and rope. Or conditioning: pot and clay.&lt;/strong> Tarzan knows clay. If you put &amp;ldquo;pot&amp;rdquo; in-front of him, he&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;clay&amp;rdquo;. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know pot.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Always look at yourself correctly. Remind yourself of your true nature. Make not the mistake of ID with what you&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tattvam is the impersonal truth. &lt;strong>Person is a manufactured phantom by the mind. It is the problem.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BG 13th chapter - prakuruti purusha vibhaga yogah - distinction between prakuruti (always in flux) and purusha (ever changeless).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is nothing static in this universe. Even when there is an equilibrium, it is an dynamic equilibrium.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>prakuruti - prakrstham krtihi - intense and constant motion, flux.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we fit ourselves into prakuruti, then we&amp;rsquo;re samsaris. When we understand our true nature as purusha distinct from prakuruti, immobile (kutastah), you&amp;rsquo;re not a samsari anymore. You&amp;rsquo;re a realized soul.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All change presupposes a changeless background. Wind is blowing because space is changeless. Waves are change-full because water is changeless.&lt;/strong> Train wagons vs. rails. This is not violation of newtons 3rd law. It applies to prakuruti, has nothing to do with purusha - you. There is no doership in you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You are the being, shining as the knowing, in which there is no doing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t cook the food. The fire cooks the food. Bertrand Russel: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;I see the flower&amp;rdquo; is a mistake. Seeing is not an act. And then you&amp;rsquo;re not a doer.&lt;/strong> Error of judgement. You better say: &amp;ldquo;The flower is seen&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is your sense of doership that haunts you to no end.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The false cannot stand scrutiny.&lt;/strong> The moment you examine it is gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sense of doership is wrong. &lt;strong>Where action is needed action happens. Man is not the actor. The natural thing happens naturally.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you making the tree grow? The same thing happens with the children.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example (bringing milk): only the doer can not do a thing. Allow the natural thing to happen naturally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no free will.&lt;/strong> What is will? Will is not free, that came from some psychology in which the mind is real, jagat is real. Vedanta should not be brought down to the level of psychology. There is only the illusion of free will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An actor does what whatever he does because the director asked it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are born in samsara. There is no free. &lt;strong>Let&amp;rsquo;s examine. Will is the desire. Will the sense of doership&lt;/strong>. Your presence makes everything function. Without you, nothing functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t do things. They are done to you. You&amp;rsquo;re lived by the cosmic life, you don&amp;rsquo;t live. You&amp;rsquo;re not the karta. You&amp;rsquo;re the karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is the our constant concern about the welfare of the body that makes the body sick.&lt;/strong> You live with no concern about it and the body will remain in a good place - you seldom become sick. You&amp;rsquo;re not the one that becomes sick. You&amp;rsquo;re the immutable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>vikara (change) is not in you. It is in the mind. Wind blowing is not in the space, but in the wind. Nothing ever happens to the space.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever you&amp;rsquo;re in distress, remember soham. Be a light to yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t create an enemy out of the mind. It is neither good nor bad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Watch the mind. The past comes in waves,&lt;/strong> it doesn&amp;rsquo;t ask for permission. You cannot stop it because you know it only after it came. It covers the mind by the recollection of the past and you&amp;rsquo;re already sorrowful. &lt;strong>You cannot prevent it. All you have to do - be alert.&lt;/strong> Be aware. Like sky, it was clear 10 min ago, now it is overcast. Be aware.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In Vedanta you don&amp;rsquo;t need progress. You need patience.&lt;/strong> Patience is not from A to B. It is now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desire is you transport into the future. In desire you seek what you do not have in the present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be &lt;strong>fully devoted to the present. Another name for the present is duty.&lt;/strong> Forget future. Now it is gone. And you live a happy and blissful life.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>alert is cit, present is sat.&lt;/strong> When the mind is calm, you&amp;rsquo;re that. Otherwise a worldly person. Just by sitting straight, eyes slightly closed mind gets calm and you cross the threshold.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t be bored by the peace, serenity of the sat cit. Learn to love the peace of sat chit. I love to be the aware-full being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>satcitanandoham = shivoham = soham = om.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Witness is always relative. Witness with respect to&amp;hellip; It must be associated with the witnessed - body/mind and world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sakshi is like daylight. It is (always shining sun-) light from the other side. Daylight is sunlight reflected in the atmosphere.&lt;/strong> Sakshi is in reference to body/mind. Citabhasa - reflection of the atman. Being citabhasa it is really speaking no different from cit, the absolute. Citabhasa, when identified, it becomes the person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Window. From one side it is part of the room, with a size etc. From the other of the unlimited space. Sakshi is window to the truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The movement of the mind must be there to experience the body and the world. If the mind becomes quiet, they vanish. And now the witnessing awareness is not witnessing anymore. It is pure awareness, the atma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We prefer the falsehood because we&amp;rsquo;ve invested in the falsehood.&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;Vested interest&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>Psychological dependence.&lt;/strong> (Christ - only when you leave everything you can be my follower).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahatmas are not inflicted by what all is happening around - body, mind, family, society, world. &lt;strong>In the eye of the cyclone, it is all sunshine, no rain, no wind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is the mind which moves in your presence, because of you, but you&amp;rsquo;re not the mind. Because of you the body is alive, but you&amp;rsquo;re not the body.&lt;/strong> Because of you there is a thing called family going on. If you want to take yourself as a family person, forget about sat cit ananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re a problem to the family if you identify as a family person. They will love you, how non-demanding, non-attached you&amp;rsquo;re, by inspired by you when you realize your self as sat cit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In non-ID the body becomes very healthy, seldom it become sick. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt the body, mind, family, community. It helps them all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you hurry you get worried. When you&amp;rsquo;re worried you get hurried. Avoid these two.&lt;/strong> If you do the things in a hurry you make more mistakes. Even in the face of a disaster, most challenging situation, you&amp;rsquo;d not hurry. Remain cool.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re greedy you&amp;rsquo;ll be afraid. When you&amp;rsquo;re attached you&amp;rsquo;ll be afraid. Sat cit ananda is not for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Worry, the hurry, the attachment and the fear you&amp;rsquo;ve to overcome.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fear is the foundation of religion.&lt;/strong> Why do you believe? Because you&amp;rsquo;re afraid. Fear and belief go together. Religion puts so much fear into the minds of the people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In religion it is all authority, and therefore fear, no understanding. In Vedanta, there should be no authority, understanding only.&lt;/strong> When there is authority, you need not think, only believe. When there is thinking, there is no authority. People are lazy, also intellectually.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True religion puts love in you, not fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Negation of ego is perfect relaxation. Ego is tension.&lt;/strong> Ego is high-energy state (like exited electrons).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give up all clinging to the body. All desire. The moment you desire things you&amp;rsquo;re likely to be disturbed (desire -&amp;gt; fear -&amp;gt; anger). You get into vikara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have desire, automatically you become free from fear and frustration. Give up also all ambition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re depressed. Be on your feet, don&amp;rsquo;t sit on a sofa. Don&amp;rsquo;t remain in a room, walk into the open. Walk rapidly, briskly. Hands and legs must move. Then brisk breathing comes. That cheers you up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Or within the house, stand in a dark corner. Take in air deeply within. Exhale trough nostrils. Do it rigorously. When breathing, tell yourself - I&amp;rsquo;m breathing the wind of the universe. Then trough the nostrils, tell yourself, I&amp;rsquo;m throwing out all laziness, all depression, all ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t be a victim of petty cares. All cares are petty cares.&lt;/strong> Realize yourself as soham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pratyak - innermost. Timeless journey in a partless land. &lt;strong>Understanding is the journey.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Would you write notes about yourself? Studying other than yourself, it makes sense. When it comes to yourself you try to understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any idea of knowing atma is not acceptable. No objectification. Atma is the knower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Studying atma is learning what all you&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To call the bluff of belief a bluff you need courage.&lt;/strong> You need courage to see the false as false. To look at the body as non-self you must be very courageous person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seeing false as false is most important. You become free from it. That is moksha, mukti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Similarity - sadrshyam - is the reason for confusion.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self is that which knows. It is the knowingness by its very nature, matrix of all nature. Knowingness which appears as all kind of knowledge (knowledge of pot, tree, scriptures, social studies &amp;hellip;). Atman is essentially the knowingness. In the presence of atman the mind appears to be the knowing entity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is insentient, jada. Whatever knows is called cit, cetana. The self. All other is jada. In the present of the self the insentient appears to be knowing. Like the lamp appears to be shining but it is some plasma. &lt;strong>In the presence of the self the insentient mind starts to show brilliantly and therefore you make the mistake of taking the mind as the atman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The body is sick. You&amp;rsquo;d not say I&amp;rsquo;m sick. Body appears as the self, is not the self. You&amp;rsquo;re the atman/knowingness/satcit/sah. Body becomes sick, mind arranges for medicine. It&amp;rsquo;s between them. We don&amp;rsquo;t do nothing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The body and the embodied are not of the same order of reality. Body is time-bound, in space and transient, the embodied is permanent, eternal, space-less.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surgeon: two people came for the same surgery. If one has dispassion towards the body, he gets cured easier. The other is obsessed, worried and takes more time to recover.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Biggest cruelty you can do to yourself is to identify with the body or mind. Biggest blessing is not to do that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The trick the mind is playing: it picks up some some sorrow as if it is now and here the fresh thing.&lt;/strong> If you identify with it, then you cannot understand the trick being played upon you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another name for presence is being. That is myself. It shines as the knowing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Difference between dead and live body. &lt;strong>Dead body has no sensation. There is no cit in it. Whereas we live by sensation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>First sensation (touch, optical), then thought. There is a gap. In case of looking the gap is so small that we miss it. There is sensation that is immediately followed by a thought that projects name and form.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can you break this habit of converting the sensation into a thought? Meaning you don&amp;rsquo;t give a name to the sensation. Then there is neither pleasure nor pain. Enjoyership is gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Thought is projection. What else? Look at a young lady. No further projection. You&amp;rsquo;re free.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mahatmas have the same sensations as samsaris. But they are beyond plasure/pain cycle.&lt;/strong> Break it. Sometimes there is enjoyment. I&amp;rsquo;m not seeking it, I&amp;rsquo;m not against it. I allow the natural thing to happen naturally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discover the gap between sensation and thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahatmas don&amp;rsquo;t divide people into good and evil. No sva (our) not para (other). Mahatmas can merge into any family. And they leave any family, just like that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good and evil is thought, not sensation. There is no good and evil in the sensation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Those who know how to withhold the thought (=projection) they overcome good and evil, sense of ownership. There is enjoyment, sometimes pleasant, sometimes painful. But you&amp;rsquo;re not the enjoyer.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For women it is also soham, not saaham, because there is no gender at the level of atma (nor intellect). It&amp;rsquo;s the right expression common to all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prakarana is more universal than Upanishad. Upanishad needs some connection to Vedic culture. Prakarana complements what the Upanishad teaches.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>World is what I experience through the window of senses and mind. This understanding makes me the master of the world. I can shut off the world by closing the window. The world experience is over and I&amp;rsquo;m with myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I&amp;rsquo;m with myself, there are no desires. There are desires only in the context of world experience. Desirelessness/fearlessness is not a goal, it is the truth of myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need the world experience to project a goal other than myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Start with the understanding that I&amp;rsquo;m the witness only.&lt;/strong> This puts an end to all kinds of self-definitions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve cut ourself from the nature by identification with the body. That becomes curse to the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowadays temples are devoted to rituals only. There used to be teaching as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;d have the quality of earnestness for Vedanta to own the vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is the desire that generates the fear when fulfilled and the frustration when not fulfilled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have an outside guru only, you yourself don&amp;rsquo;t take up the role of the sat guru, the inner guru, you remain ignorant. &lt;strong>You guide yourself. You be a preceptor unto yourself. You tell yourself I&amp;rsquo;m the witness only.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Normal, routine, common, universal experiences are enough if examined carefully to understand your true nature. No need for any mystical experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who is it that is aware of the constant change happening to the mind?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m the witness. &lt;strong>The procession is that of the mind. Thought procession.&lt;/strong> Can you be a guide to yourself to remain yourself that you&amp;rsquo;re not involved? This job the outside guru cannot do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Witness is very much like space. The space is not contaminated by anything it contains.&lt;/strong> If you identify, then you cannot be a witness anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Did you notice all the forms of god are human in nature? I&amp;rsquo;m a form therefore god has to be a (very similar) form. A mental form is as gross as the physical form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advice to householders in BG: keep yajna, tapah, danam in your live. Danam is danam only when you give to the needy and deserving. It must be spontaneous, otherwise you become a professional philanthropist. What you do spontaneous it remains with you, your secret.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you do things spontaneously it is likely to remain all good.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t own nothing. You currently posses, have presently with you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>If you have 24h hour identification with body and/or mind, you&amp;rsquo;ll not be able to sleep.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Outer light helps you to know everything. Inner light - awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First you become aware of your self. Then of body/mind. Then of the world. &lt;strong>First light of the sun, then everything.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>soham ityavadhAraya - I&amp;rsquo;m that is to be understood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>states (waking, dreaming, sleeping) belong to the mind. &lt;strong>Sun has no states, it is the same all the time. There is no time in sun.&lt;/strong> Time is there only on the earth. Because earth rotates around itself and the sun.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to get self-confidence? Just recognise your competence. Hanuman (was competent, not confident) - Jambavan discussion. You lack understanding. Know yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Incomplete data. There are three states and you take only the data offered by the waking state only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without the unconscious there cannot be conscious. Tree is not possible without the seed.&lt;/strong> The manifest is not possible without the unmanifest. Allow the unconscious to flow into the conscious. How to? Sit in meditation and be silent. When the mind is silent you&amp;rsquo;re aware but the waking state is no more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without deep-sleep waking state is not even possible. Meditate upon it. Reenact it. You&amp;rsquo;re there (always), but the mind is not. It brings enormous rest and relaxation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you prove yourself, you need not prove the theological god anymore.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You always know the falsehood only. The truth you&amp;rsquo;ll not know.&lt;/strong> You yourself are the truth. &lt;strong>What we call knowledge is always knowledge of ignorance alone.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Idealism: &lt;strong>the hero and the heroine they are inside your head but you see them outside on the screen.&lt;/strong> Realism: what you see outside and is outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta: waking state is idealism. Samsara: waking state is realism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waking up to the truth = knowing better.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is moving, it is the dream. Mind is moving, it is the waking. Mind stops moving, you go to deep sleep. Mind becomes entirely still, even when you&amp;rsquo;re awake - waking state is no more. Therefore waking state is entirely manufactured by the mind and its movement.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmacari cooking upma. What are you cooking? &amp;ldquo;Brahman&amp;rdquo;. Swami: &lt;strong>Never ever trivialize this great vision. Don&amp;rsquo;t ridicule it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no calamities in life. There are only happenstances. It is the ignorant mind that creates misfortunes, calamities, desires by saying this is valuable, this not. Then it creates fears, insecurities.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Movie is a passing show. Dream is a passing show. This incident that is going on now is maybe only a passing show.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the waking state? It is not a few things that are there. It is a series of experiences. Is it not &amp;ldquo;coffee there&amp;rdquo;. It is your &amp;ldquo;tasking up coffee here&amp;rdquo;. It is not &amp;ldquo;your son accomplishing something&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;your experience of son accomplishing something&amp;rdquo;. Suppose there is a thing which you never experience. Such a thing, does it even exist? It can be imagination only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This world exists only because you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing it. It is the object of waking experience.&lt;/strong> It hangs by the thread by your experiencing it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience of nothing (nothingness of the sleep) is also an experience. Which is illuminated by the inner light of awareness. &lt;strong>In the deep sleep you&amp;rsquo;re aware of nothing but you&amp;rsquo;re still aware.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Know yourself correctly and be liberated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sakshat - directly. Mind is known directly whereas the world is known through the intermediary of the mind and sense organs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Peace of mind, serenity, you&amp;rsquo;ll experience only when you know you&amp;rsquo;re not the doer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Job is done when you uplift yourself. Nobody uplifts others.&lt;/strong> Things happen. You don&amp;rsquo;t do. Just like a person riding a camel. Why don&amp;rsquo;t you put your bag on the camel? Oh, the camel needs to carry already my weight. I better ease it for him by carrying it myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re not the doer of anything.&lt;/strong> A single action is made possible by innumerable elements involved in it. Understand it and be at peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-17httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_dlnlmad2ik">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dlNlmAd2ik">Class 17&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Absence of experiences is also an experience and once again, I&amp;rsquo;m aware of it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-realization: I&amp;rsquo;m what I&amp;rsquo;m.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When &lt;strong>one slips into body ID -&amp;gt; animal man. ID with life force, intellect -&amp;gt; normal man.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prana and intellect word in tandem. &lt;strong>Prana is blind, buddhi is lame.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Concepts - feeding people with words (=ideas). Religious life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does the cup limit the water? Yes. Does the cup limit the space? No. You can say space is everywhere and is reflecting in the cup.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Serving the purpose, negatively or positively, doesn&amp;rsquo;t prove reality of it.&lt;/strong> The unreal serves as much purpose as real. An unreal serpent creates as much consequence as a real serpent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waking state is full of opposites. Sukha/dukha. Dharma/adharma. The ground of awareness is not contaminated by either. In that sense it is transcendent. To that extent it is called immanent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Walls and the castles do not imprison us. Our false notions imprison us. Once you see the false as false you&amp;rsquo;re free from the bondage of falsehood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Image - psychological. Word - verbal. Both can&amp;rsquo;t reach the truth. The actual is beyond the words and images.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Way to listen to the shastra - actualization of what you hear and think and lastly feel. Feeling is deeper than thinking. &lt;strong>Thinking is rupa, word is nama, feeling is the actualization.&lt;/strong> Not needed in religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awareness illuminates the body. Body is known to you, shines in the awareness. How can there be ID between the two.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever you see, is outside the eyes. Whatever you&amp;rsquo;re aware of, is other than the awareness.&lt;/strong> And it is limited. While your awareness you can envelope entire galaxy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can say I&amp;rsquo;m the sun only when you&amp;rsquo;re not the body but the awarefull presence. First in the body and then everywhere else. I&amp;rsquo;m the light of this body and light of this universe. Like the light that illuminates the cup also illuminates the entire hall.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What I&amp;rsquo;m is left open. Nothing concrete is said. The moment you do, you commit a mistake against yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>With respect to the body/mind the sakshi is the chitabhasa. With respect to its source its atman absolute.&lt;/strong> Chitabhasa is the window. One side of the window is the sun, the other is the room.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-18httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvntqupfxhcfs---love-beauty">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQUPFXhcfs">Class 18&lt;/a> - love, beauty&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>root(pri) -&amp;gt; priti, priyam etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worldly people do not know what is love. Love is not memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is sorrow? A thought. What is ego? A thought. Thus &lt;strong>only when you think there is the ego.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind collects a few elements and creates a person out of it, the ego. Ego doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what is love. In the context of ego there is only attachment. Ego is the attachment.&lt;/strong> There is no division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A 10 dollar cellphone is not &amp;ldquo;my cellphone&amp;rdquo;. It is &amp;ldquo;cellphone&amp;rdquo;, it is a useful thing. A 1000 dollar cellphone is &amp;ldquo;my cellphone&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ego is attached to (physical) objects.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re beautiful, not the flower. Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re not beautiful, the flower will not be beautiful. &lt;strong>The ego is always outside. The beauty of the atman is in you. It is you. People only know the outward, physical, artificial beauty created by thought.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When I read a verse that is beautiful, listen to some nice things being said by a mahatma, when I see a wild meadow, that is beautiful to me. Not your &lt;strong>carefully orchestrated burden.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The father wants his son to become engineer. Is that possessing and dominating? We want children to think the way we think, to desire what we desire. To fear what we fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ACID test: in love, there is freedom. &lt;strong>In dominating and possessing there is no freedom.&lt;/strong> Puja Swami: &amp;ldquo;The amount of freedom you give to the other person is equal to the amount of freedom you get.&amp;rdquo; Love engenders freedom while attachment is bondage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Known is memory, mind, thought. Mind moves from the known to the known only.&lt;/strong> It cannot move from the known to the unknown. &lt;strong>The way to realize the unknown is negating the known.&lt;/strong> Attachment is known to us and therefore we negate the attachment. Approach love negatively, not positively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Possession brings out jealousy. When you possess the son, you compare and become jealous. Rank means comparison, and you want a better rank - that is ambition. And you don&amp;rsquo;t get the rank you desire, that is conflict. And somebody else gets the higher rank - that is jealousy.&lt;/strong> Children don&amp;rsquo;t have any of these things, unless they evtl. learn from us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Classical mother/daughter in law syndrome is fear of the mother of losing her son.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sensation, sentimentality - emotionalism - is not love. Love can never turn to hatred.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you respect your servant? You respect the boss. That is no respect. Only if you respect the lowliest of the lowly then only you&amp;rsquo;ll know what is love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the social life, where authority and hierarchy is, the respect you show is not love. In the religious life, the reverence you show to the guru is not the true reverence. There also you go by hierarchy. You divide people.&lt;/strong> That is not love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where there is no respect, there is no love. Similarly when there is no mercy, pity, forgiveness, there is no love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When these things do not occupy your mind, then you&amp;rsquo;ll know what is love in you heart. Only when you discover love you&amp;rsquo;ll be transformed. You&amp;rsquo;ve to discover you&amp;rsquo;re not the person you think yourself to be. You&amp;rsquo;re the divinity. Imagine how much inner transformation you need for that? Transmutation!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Systems, cults, sects, rituals, rituals, celebrations &amp;hellip; cannot bring inner transformation. Only love can.&lt;/strong> You do really love only when you not possess, you do not dominate, you&amp;rsquo;re not envious, not greedy. When you&amp;rsquo;re respectful, when you&amp;rsquo;ve mercy, compassion all the way. When you&amp;rsquo;ve enormous sensitivity for all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the things made of hands occupy your mind,&lt;/strong> like costly classes, costly cell-phone, car, food, parties, attires &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>you&amp;rsquo;ll now know what is love.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do not anything. FYI, you don&amp;rsquo;t own even your own body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>parigraha. Accumulation. The acquisitive spirit. If it occupies your mind, it kills the heart, the love&lt;/strong>. It is the monstrosity of the superstition. There is not an iota of truth in that. When you discover the love&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love of the atman. I love not only my son. I love all the sons. I love all people. I love all animals. I love a blade of grass. I love all. That is what love is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In ego&amp;rsquo;s attachment there is the fragrance of the love of atman. Even in attachment you experience the joy (of atman) when things go your way.&lt;/strong> In ego&amp;rsquo;s attachment is sipping of the love of atman. &lt;strong>The love of the self is spilling into your experience.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a ripe ego the love of the attachment of the son can transform it self to the pure love of the son.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is your inner-most self that is the source of joy, not the experience of SOMETHING. People in their folly believe that SOMETHING makes them happy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you see the Picasso and there is joy it comes not from Picasso but from your self, which is the same as Picasso&amp;rsquo;s joy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understanding of this is freedom. Don&amp;rsquo;t throw away the objects. But then you might even not cling to the objects. When there is time to give up you give up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love of your son should not be auxiliary (shesha) as attachment to the ego. It should be auxiliary as all-encompassing love to the atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Beauty could be attribute of the insentient? Or is it the attribute of the sentient?&lt;/strong> What is beautiful in insentient. Jada cannot have beauty. Beauty is not an attribute of physical things. &lt;strong>Beauty is the innate essence of the inner-most self. That&amp;rsquo;s why the self experiences everywhere wheres the worldly person has to spend a lot of money to experience the beauty.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nothing but atma is lovable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m is fundamentally the being. But then the being which is shining as the knowing. Suppose you say the &amp;ldquo;book is&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;is&amp;rdquo; is the being. But &lt;strong>the book doesn&amp;rsquo;t shine by itself. It shines only when there is mind, eyesight and the knowingness (atma). Whereas the being shines by itself.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t acquire eyesight, mind. It shines by itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decartes went to the restaurant. Waiter: &amp;ldquo;do you think you need any food?&amp;rdquo; Decartes: &amp;ldquo;I think not.&amp;rdquo; And then he vanished.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="class-19httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjp98hlyqra8">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP98HLyQRa8">Class 19&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Detachment is not a process, not an effort, just shifting the attention away from the world simply by looking at myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eyesight is not like a camera, it is like a mirror. &lt;strong>Eyesight is not attached. As I close the eyes, does the eyesight miss any of those countless forms? If you carefully examine, the answer is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m fine. The absence of forms does not make me deficient in any way.&lt;/strong> This is a revelation that I&amp;rsquo;m not attached to any form what so ever.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why do you love ice cream/money/nice home? Because you love yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I was never sorrowful in my life and I will never become sorrowful in future also. I&amp;rsquo;m the very ground of supreme (para) love (prema).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Real sorrow should have crashed you by now, you would have not arrived at where you&amp;rsquo;re are now. You only imagined that you&amp;rsquo;re sorrowful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Stop dividing.&lt;/strong> No suppression, no driving away thus no separation (of me from the anger), no escape from the anger. No conflict. You&amp;rsquo;re aware of the anger. Once you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the anger it will go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>See the trick of the mind: &lt;strong>the movement called &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; is the same as &amp;ldquo;anger&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> Mind creates a conflict between me and anger and wants to escape it, unless you recognize it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you&amp;rsquo;re angry/sorrowful there is a very pronounced &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; there. And that &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; makes the sorrow appear magnified.&lt;/strong> When you don&amp;rsquo;t divide and thus there is no attempt to escape the sorrow by 1) making more money 2) pursuing pleasures 3) religion - rituals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is not my sorrow. It is the &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; that is sorrowful and it is the sorrow which creates the &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The sorrow is a guest. It comes, stays for a while and goes away. Joy is intrinsic.&lt;/strong> A sorrowful person goes to sleep - he&amp;rsquo;s happy. A happy person goes to sleep - he&amp;rsquo;s happy. &lt;strong>Whatever comes, will go. Whatever is, is.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Physical pain might be inevitable but sorrow is optional.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Self-identification with the limited (physical object) is the real cause of the suffering. There is sofa. Not &amp;ldquo;my sofa&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To what are you attached? Consciousness? Nothing happened to it. Life? Panca bhutas? Nothing happened to them either. You can be attached only to form.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is addicted to thinking wrongly: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m this and I&amp;rsquo;m that.&amp;rdquo; Thus it constantly fears the loss.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Root of psychological suffering is the ignorance of the self. People do not know the self and they do not know that they do not know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re looking with total attention, there is no division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you use the word experience, it is not conceptual knowledge. It is more direct perception. That&amp;rsquo;s why we say &amp;ldquo;spiritual experience&amp;rdquo;. But &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; in the context of realization of the truth is not like experiencing a sunset with the eyes &amp;hellip; There is no duality in this particular &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vrtti - modification of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>ego, the person, is not the real self. It is the historic self. Every person is a walking biography.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tvam is not the ego, it is the real self. The real meaning of aham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you have a sense of me only when you are frustrated, angry, unhappy &amp;hellip; It is possible to be aware of things without being the ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bodhaha (boda) - awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sakshi is a very provisional status. It is sakshi not intrinsically, only in reference to sakshyam. That is the meaning of tvam.
A way to solve problems - deny the very problem itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why do you call mind &amp;ldquo;my mind&amp;rdquo;? &lt;strong>It never ever obliged me. Why should I call it &amp;ldquo;my mind&amp;rdquo;? Don&amp;rsquo;t believe your mind. Step back from it - be a witness to the mind. If the mind is sorrowful, be a witness to the sorrow. Don&amp;rsquo;t be the ego, which is the sorrow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Watch the pain. Keep the external external. I&amp;rsquo;m not the pain, don&amp;rsquo;t internalize.&lt;/strong> BG: sparshAn krvtvA bahir bAhyAn. Same for sorrow of the mind, or any other emotion of it. &lt;strong>That sorrow is the other. I&amp;rsquo;m the higher dimension of pure light of awareness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no action involved on the part of the light. Illumination is not an action. &lt;strong>Knowing is not action. Knowledge is separate category, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t commander the category of action. Watching is not doing, it is not a job, action. It is illuminating.&lt;/strong> When you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the mind you&amp;rsquo;re termed the witness of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughts float through the mind like sounds float through the air. And you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Witnessing of whatever happens (is present in the mind) is most simple, spontaneous. It is not a new thing you have to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Witness is the great unborn - ajah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Searching for the witness is missing the point all together.&lt;/strong> You be the witness. &lt;strong>No sadhana is the best sadhana.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Situations around constantly change the qualities of the mind - vikara. Of these is the witness completely free from.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>World, body, sense-organs, mind, intellect, ego - unreal. Witness - real/unreal. Awareness absolute - real. Witness is the window to the truth.&lt;/strong> In witnessing the awareness is aware of the mind. Whereas in absolute awareness the awareness is not even aware of itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sharana - refuge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t contradict yourself. If you want health, deserve health. If you want peace, deserve peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are no things independent of knowledge. The pot cannot have an existence separate of knowledge. There are no actions separate from knowledge. &lt;strong>On the movie screen, can you have some part not enveloped by the projector?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is not the things, not the actions. It is the experience of the things. It is the experience of actions.&lt;/strong> Some experience we label as pleasure and pursue them, and some as pain and we avoid them. Thus we&amp;rsquo;re caught in the net of experiences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Witnessing is stepping back from an experience and externalising it. Not only with unpleasant but also pleasant ones.&lt;/strong> You remain avikari - unmodified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Somebody says nice things, I do feel good, but I step back. Somebody else says some silly things, I might feel a little disturbed, but I step back.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Food should be proper. Meditation is the way. Witnessing is the way and goal. &lt;strong>You need to have a light body and mindset.&lt;/strong> Should be laghu, not guru.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>The fact that you are aware of something eliminates the possibility that you&amp;rsquo;re it at the same time. Eyes cannot see themselves. Hand cannot touch itself. Mind does not know itself. It is the higher dimension that illuminates it and is aware of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a-kasha, pra-kasha. Kasha is the awareness which illuminates both. It is also called Kashi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Between body and the pure light of awareness is the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The reflection has its own characteristics. Sun appears small in a waterdrop. Chitabhasa = &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; in the mind. It can identify with either the body or the source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Quality of the reflection is based upon the perfection of the mind.&lt;/strong> Because of the crudity of the mind and ID with the body you become a person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind lacks discrimination because of tamo- and rajoguna. Sattva stands for the purity of the mind. Correct knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowledge is everything. Knowledge is very powerful. Remove rajo und tamoguna and he mind is pure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Desire (rajas) or fear (tamas). Don&amp;rsquo;t give it the strength of ID (saying &amp;ldquo;my desire&amp;rdquo;). Creating a division, leading to conflict. Just be aware of it (&amp;ldquo;there is a desire&amp;rdquo; - no conflict).&lt;/strong> It won&amp;rsquo;t be strong or powerful. It will just be there. And slowly it will disappear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A little of rajas and tamas won&amp;rsquo;t hurt you. A bit of them is needed. To do stuff, you need rajas. To sleep, to eat food, you need tamas. But they won&amp;rsquo;t dominate you. &lt;strong>You know yourself as the spirit.&lt;/strong> That is the moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jaska in nirruktam defines 6 stages (shat bhava vikara) of material objects: jayate, asti (duration), viparinamate (change), vardhate (grows), apakshiyate (decline), nashyati (vanish).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t expect the market people, religion to enlighten you. They won&amp;rsquo;t help you to disidentify with the body. It is the lot of philosopher. Like a guy who always brings bad news. That&amp;rsquo;s why most of the preacher and gurus gave up philosophy and ventured into religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Philosopher: the earlier death comes the better. You know troubles associated with long life. &lt;strong>Not longevity but senility.&lt;/strong> Sanat kumara was happy with being turned into camel so he would not have to cook the food.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No wonder there is conflict everywhere. We go on living having forgotten who our true self.&lt;/strong> It is the life of shadow self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pratibhasika = appearance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All the thoughts resolve into I&amp;rsquo;m. I&amp;rsquo;m-ness also resolves to pure awareness.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m-ness is the window to the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no difference between I&amp;rsquo;m-ness and pure light of awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Human nature: first take care of the world. -&amp;gt; Religious nature: first ask what is god? -&amp;gt; Philosophy: first and foremost know yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before going into the world, which is not a very friendly place, you&amp;rsquo;d know yourself. &lt;strong>You can be happy and secure in the world, living and interacting in the world, provided you know yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot know God, unless you know yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Before going into the world, you&amp;rsquo;d know yourself, or else it will bind you&lt;/strong>, even in most favourable circumstances.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your god is based on your estimate on yourself. First understand yourself, not god. Understanding oneself - tvampadartha zodhanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Theocentric vs. homocentric religion.&lt;/strong> Which do you want to follow? Religion of puranas is theocentric. Religion of karmakhanda is theocentric. Religion of the upanishads is homocentric. Religion of Buddha is homocentric. That&amp;rsquo;s why there was a conflict (karmakhanda).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami: sometimes I ask why old and new testament are printed together. New testament is a revolution over old testament. Until Vatican converted it again into theocentric. Same in vedas, karma khanda and upanishads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there is a contect between tvam and tat, true religion is centered around tvam. Homocentric. That is Vedanta.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a patriarchal society, this young man starts the relationship with his wife with a sense of superiority and domination. The lady is willing to submit and that&amp;rsquo;s how the entire society survives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognise higher and lower. Is beyond divisions. Start relationship with love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even in the human relationship you estimate of yourself is the critical element. What to speak of religion. Your understanding of god will depend upon depending your understanding of yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tat, which is the infinite, is embedded in tvam. How to realize that? Remove boundaries of tat and tvam itself emerges as tat.&lt;/strong> tat estimated wrongly is separate from tvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Realizing god can be done only in one way, realizing one&amp;rsquo;s own divinity. That&amp;rsquo;s why &lt;strong>tvam takes priority.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negative understanding is the highest understanding. When you negate the four elements, what is left is the space. All positive understanding understanding comes under the category of ajnana. &lt;strong>The right way to arrive at the truth is to see the false as false, which is not easy. Gradually a stage comes when all the negative understanding is in place and then you come to direct appreciation, direct perception in which the real, the tat, is understood in positive terms.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is a sin to call yourself a sinner.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you take yourself wrongly as a person than your god will be also a person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the outer (false) self calls itself for a person then it is separate from all the other persons. The outer self is always seeking advantage, anxious, afraid. Sometimes cheerful, sometimes bold. Lustful, doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what is love. Sick and healthy. Old and young.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to negate the outer self all the way. The real self is unchanging - kutastah. There is only one which is the self of all, incl. animals, vegetables and mineral kingdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The spirit of true religion is essentially a change of heart&lt;/strong>. Replacing the egoism with divinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Special spell, which makes is free, not bound. Love. You&amp;rsquo;re unbound.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True love, which has no opposite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Show the path of love which stops the winds of the hatred to the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>realized = Real-ized. ized = to make, to actualize. You have to understand tvam, not just gain some knowledge of tvam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need a humble heart to admit and acknowledge the gap between knowledge and realization. Then realization is not far away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If I acquire knowledge I have to make it real. Not come with an external reason for the gap like &amp;ldquo;I need the grace of Ishvara&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the mind is impure&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Basic difference between true and popular religion. In popular you need not realize anything. Believing and following is enough. That is the ritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Religion is realization.&lt;/strong> That discontent, that I have not yet realized, one should have.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hear, understand and realize.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the way it has to go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Yoga is what unites tvam with tat.&lt;/strong> In yoga there are no failures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Idea is never the truth. Few things are not: word, idea, symbol (murti). Then knowledge is not realization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman means the vastness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge is always of the limited, of things. Knowledge of the brahman is a contradiction.&lt;/strong> Table limits the book and the book limits the table - one cannot occupy the same space at the same time as the other. No object of the universe can limit brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman is the substratum of every object. What you call the table is brahman with a certain limitation. Brahman with nama rupa added is the table.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You must be able to negate nama rupa only then you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to go to the underlying reality. Suppose you negate all nama rupa. Now the consciousness is free from all the nama rupas and you brahman is already with you. No need to invite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the mind becomes silent, there is the quality of spaciousness in that silence.&lt;/strong> Where there is nama rupa, distraction, there is no silence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is time in consciousness or consciousness is in time?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being able to contemplate upon something means being able to understand and realize.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world itself is the unknown and unknowable. There are a trillion galaxies with millions of stars in them. A table is 99.99% space. And 0.001% of matter. And that matter is atoms made of particles. What are the particles? Nobody knows. Now &lt;strong>you cannot ask the question &amp;ldquo;how is it created?&amp;rdquo; What is there to be created? You can only ask the question &amp;ldquo;how come it appears this way?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> How come I experience is as this? What is the basis for this experience?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Aristotelean materialism the consciousness is byproduct of matter. Whereas in Sankhya system the consciousness is an independent entity. Vedanta: brahman is substantive (means that alone is real) and constituent material cause.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Matter is something illuminated by the consciousness, not independent of consciousness.&lt;/strong> Which is subservient? &lt;strong>Both are one and the same and that is the brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>tat - something that is unknown and unknowable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vidita - known. Both vidita and avidita are in our experience. &lt;strong>What you call unknown is also within your experience.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are always anxious to reach out beyond &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; (world) to reach out for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your consciousness has the history of entire humankind. Brain is the product of millions of years of evolution. Your DNA has the history of the entire mankind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is already in our experience. We&amp;rsquo;re saturated with it, we&amp;rsquo;re unhappy with it. It constantly creates problems and that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re constantly trying to reach out, not reach in, for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is security in the known. Keep your (false) security! But you&amp;rsquo;ll be bound. Come out out of the security created by words, concepts, ideas. There must be a discontent, revolt in you. To reach out for t(h)at. In t(h)at human consciousness there is this vijnasa. Because this is unsatisfactory.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once the discontent is gone you&amp;rsquo;re unfit to know the truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tat - paramatma, tvam - the historic self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>jagat is myself and what I experience. tat is its the origin, the cause of the subject-object duo. Subject is I&amp;rsquo;m, object is there is. The origin is neither subjective (mind) nor objective (matter)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In Vedanta you don&amp;rsquo;t have definitions. You only have pointers. Because the real is beyond known and unknown, beyond the senses and the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gravitation is the origin of matter. Matter is space. Mind is always past, future - movement - therefore time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tat is all.&lt;/strong> Substantive and constituent cause. Not the Aristotelean material cause. &lt;strong>And yet it is nothing. Gold is all ornaments. But it is not an ornament.&lt;/strong> It is the totality and the exclusion. It is the immanent and yet transcendent. &lt;strong>It is the fullness and also it is emptiness.&lt;/strong> Look at space - it is both.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The day you started to fill your braincells with definitions that day your study has divorced from realization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot describe it but you can lose yourself in it.&lt;/strong> Like space. When mind becomes silent it becomes spacious.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ve to deny reality to both subject and object.&lt;/strong> To all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Philosophy: object is real = realism. Subject is real = idealism. Advaita Vedanta is beyond both. Generally you start with realism, come to idealism, rise above it also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>World is the same as world experience. World experience is the product of senses (provide the nama) and the mind (provides the rupa). Deny reality to the world experience. Now you come to the subject (historic self). Deny reality to it also. Then you come to t(h)at which cannot be denied. That is brahman, that is paramatma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body is the scaffold, for both mind and senses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even a very well trained mind cannot conceptualize it. It is beyond. Even the attempt to know the mind by the mind is a contradiction. Mind moves from known to the known.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why do you think you need the mind to know? &lt;strong>The silly jada senses, mind know with the light of atma. Atman cannot know all by itself? Why do you think you need the mind to know?&lt;/strong> Leave the mind behind. &lt;strong>You know atma by its own light&lt;/strong>. Now the means of knowing is its very light.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m the guest. What you sense first? Guest-ness or being? Being. I&amp;rsquo;m is the sensing of the being. There is a pot. What is first? The sense of being. What is the division between the sense of being &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;there is&amp;rdquo;, subject and object?&lt;/strong> identification, &lt;strong>ajnana is the boundary&lt;/strong> . Body and mind are objects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being is its own pointer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the upasanas dvaitam is provisionally accepted. If you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with saguna brahma you can use the word &amp;ldquo;manifest&amp;rdquo;. Talking about nirguna brahma you have to use the word appearance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The being is what you&amp;rsquo;re sensing. &lt;strong>Always you&amp;rsquo;re sensing the being. But you think that nama rupa you&amp;rsquo;re sensing. Example: what are you sensing, cup or clay? Don&amp;rsquo;t relay upon eyes all the time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say subject it is the being what you sense. When you say object it is the being what you sense. The being is still limited. Take care to dismiss nama rupa. When nama rupa has to be attached, why do you call it being? That object, whether the subject sense of beidg or object sense of being is the pointer to the real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pointer is not limited in space time. satta is the pointer. Everywhere you&amp;rsquo;re sensing satta (not roads, buildings, pots). In sensing that being becomes a pointer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you call &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo; is reduced to here/there, now/then, this/that &amp;hellip; pairs of opposites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re not hurt by anything. If something says against us/Rama &amp;hellip; we bless him. Philosophical mind never gets hurt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re like a frog in the well. There is so much wisdom out in the world. &lt;strong>On the part of Rshis/Upanishads there is a tremendous effort not to objectify brahman. By doing that you&amp;rsquo;re making brahman jada. You convert it to tamoguna.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sat is the being. Satyaha is the truth. Shankara: yat sat tat satyam - what is is the truth. &lt;strong>What is called being that alone is the truth. The being of the subject is the truth. But the subject itself is not truth. The being of the object is the truth. But the object itself is not truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>When you miss it, it becomes shunya. When you catch it, it becomes purna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>pot is unreal (abhava). Idealists (vijnanavadis) stop there, for them that is the truth. That is zunyavada.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taste of your mouth exists, you experience it, but you can&amp;rsquo;t say whether it is sweet, pungent &amp;hellip; It is pointed by the abhava by all six tastes. It is what remains after all these tastes are negated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Arrogance of scholarships (I know &amp;hellip; and teach &amp;hellip;) puts the person entirely on the wrong track. Negation gives you humility.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there are distinctions, there are reactions. When there are no distinction, here is only action. What remains is very simple and you cannot describe it. It is very solid, like a diamond. You cannot describe it, it is real.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When mind is active, you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with distinctions. There is only rationalizations. Too much of rationalization doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave you anywhere. When the mind is silent, there is only wonder (bhakti).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is habituated to distinctions and reactions. And reaction of the mind is expressed in speech and movement. Robot.&lt;/strong> This is what we do in temples. That mechanicalness kills the creativity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is no reaction in your heart, shesha remains. Isvhara is called sheshsa. Bhagavatam: shishyate iti shesha samjgnaha. That snake thing is the agrarian mindset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sunyavadi: &lt;code>no-thing-less&lt;/code> remains. Not all-together different from advaita&amp;rsquo;s purnatvam. That&amp;rsquo;s why they say purnata (&lt;code>nothing-ness&lt;/code>)&lt;/strong>. Buddha is the student of upanishads. He was not a ritualist. His purnata does not contradict what he&amp;rsquo;s learned - the upanishads. Buddha is atmavadi, not sunyavadi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman is the unconditioned. How can you describe the unconditioned?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Krishna: Akarshati papat. Is a positive hint to connect with the real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Vedanta we&amp;rsquo;re not very keen on positive terms. Positive terms are only hints, understood properly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Happiness is happening when you&amp;rsquo;re not seeking happiness. When you&amp;rsquo;re seeking it the &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; is seeking it and therefore there cannot be any happiness. Any desire puts the sense of me, that&amp;rsquo;s how it is created.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If there &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; that is attachment, not love.&lt;/strong> Love is caitanyam. That &lt;strong>sentient being (table cannot have love)&lt;/strong> is brahman is manifesting as love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ananda with oneself, prema with relating to everybody else. In fact they&amp;rsquo;re not different.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brahman is neither saguna, nor nirguna. It is what it is. Ajatah vada.&lt;/strong> Saguna -&amp;gt; nirguna -&amp;gt; ajatah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is only one brahma. Wrong question cannot be answered, only shown as wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Wind is one. But it goes around the entire universe and acquires all kinds of shapes. Breeze, hurricane&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>The inherent power to become many must be there in Vayu. Same for fire. Same for brahman. That is the shakti of saguna brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When explaining the jagat, then you have to resort to saguna brahman. For saguna teachers, words like nishkriya, nirguna sound bad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ajnana of cit, caytanyam makes you believe, that the two forms of cit, jiva and isvara are real. How do you know the ajnana of cit? By cit only.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When somebody questions the belief it results in animosity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishnu is rich peoples&amp;rsquo; god. Shiva is poor peoples&amp;rsquo; god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you have leader, you stop thinking.&lt;/strong> Leader is context of knowledge is one who thinks on your behalf. Once you stop thinking you go into a belief system easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example: a person who has seen the ocean describes it to somebody who has never seen it. Similarly the acarya describing the tat to a worldly person as sarvajnah, sarvashaktih&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Peoples&amp;rsquo; self definition is usually based on the account of their actions performed, usually work. I&amp;rsquo;m a doctor, teacher etc. Define yourself based on your power of knowing. Everybody has it, only few pay attention to it. I&amp;rsquo;m a philosopher, mathematician, researcher&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No matter how much you know the sphere of knowing is always smaller then the sphere of ignorance. When you declare what you know you also declare what you don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you know the real it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how much unreal you know.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you call ice, steam, water is water only. There is not water as such. It is sat alone appearing as water. Everything is sat only. That sat is brahman.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Brahman is not something else. It is not only transcendental, but it is immanent - substantive and constitutive cause of everything in the universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman was there before creation. Brahman has become all. Sarvabhavana. Substantive and constitutive cause. Adhisthana of entire universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Idealism: there are objects and conciousness. Brahman is that which is beyond both. It alone becomes the conciousness as well its objects. Yet it is beyond both.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind and matter are the states of the same reality. That reality is stateless. If it is a state, you can describe it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman is utter stillness, quietness. Movement is maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>svayamprakasha - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any other pramana than itself. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is called aprameyaha. It is not and it need not to be available for other pramana. &lt;strong>You know yourself as the awareness absolute just by being.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t think you know just by pratyaksha, anumana or shabda (book) etc. Final is knowing by being.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignorant silence: hathayogi. Atmayogi&amp;rsquo;s silence is like a computer with all information going to sleep. That silence is full of vision, inner understanding. There is a name for it: Intelligence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To know brahman, you do not need the mind. In fact, it becomes an obstacle.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind only knows attachment, if disturbed it becomes aversion. Mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t know love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All divisions are in citta, the mind. None in cit, the brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What all you say about god is not coming from god. It is coming from you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Puja Swamiji: God has made man in his image -&amp;gt; once the man makes the god in his image. That god makes the man in his image. Therefore you&amp;rsquo;re the god you&amp;rsquo;re worshiping. When you&amp;rsquo;re describing tvam it emerges as tat. When you&amp;rsquo;re describing tat it emerges as tvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There cannot be a god without a devotee. God is the blossoming of devotion.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mathematician talks of the infinite of something that is known. Vedantin&amp;rsquo;s infinite is not known.&lt;/strong> That which mind cannot reach. You can reach it by being the infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You know brahman by looking at the prapanca, understanding the prapanca and then negating the prapanca. There is no other way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot negate something which you don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brgu went to Varuna, his father. Varuna did not even teach. He said you find out the god. Why teach? It cannot be taught. It has to be discovered in your heart as the inner-most self. Varuna did teach how to discover.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ready made brahman: one mantra, one tatra, one yantra.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Christianity, their theology, is nowadays all about miracles. You are made a saint if you perform miracles. This is not vedanta. This is devanta. Vedanta is that which encourages you to know that which is worth knowing if you want freedom.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brahman created this universe - brahmAnda. The moment brahman enters into the cosmic body is not anymore brahman. It becomes cosmic person - hiranyagrabha. Brahman is the same as hiranyagrabha. Hiranyagarbha has another name - prathama jivaha. We&amp;rsquo;re all the offspring of it. What is called Hiranyagarbha in upanishads is called Brahmadeva in puranas.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishnu is also Hiranyagarbha, Shiva also. What is Hiranyagarbha that you&amp;rsquo;re. In your case brahman entered this single body. Entered as jiva (individual soul).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shining is knowing.&lt;/strong> That inner shining. Eyes know, nose knows, ears know. Mind and thoughts. You&amp;rsquo;re aware of everything. That is the brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; is also a thought. Just like any other thought. Somebody is dancing or studying or watching movie &amp;hellip; it is all thought. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a desire/fear it is a thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>See the eyes, see the ears. It is obvious that brahman has entered as jiva.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What entered and what is there cannot be two different things.&lt;/strong> The family person entering the bus and the passenger now are not two different persons. Two are there - that is dvaita. Dvaita people have converted all pravesha shruti into dead letter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The inner light of this body-mind is the brahman.&lt;/strong> If brahman has entered how can be jiva other than brahman? This is the spirit of pravesha zruti. There is no physical entering, it is a metaphor to establish oneness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sruti - in Veda you only hear. Read is book.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do I belong to the limit body/mind or do I belong to the infinite life within, the inner light, brahman?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose I&amp;rsquo;m cut off from the Vayu of the universe and stay with my limited breath. How long will I live? I&amp;rsquo;m with svasa or am I with infinite Vayu? This is called Pranoupasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your heart is the meeting place of brahman and the body/mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Die to the mind: die to the memories of the past. Die to the imaginations of the future. Die to your attachments, aversions, frustrations, anger, greed&amp;hellip; Die to your ownership and possessions.&lt;/strong> This is the crucification of the Christ. The jiva identified with the body/mind has to die to the body/mind. Not tomorrow, but now. That is yoga. That is the spirit of pravesha shruti. That is the learning of Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What you think you know about Shiva, is not knowledge. It is ideation. Without knowing, mind forms ideas. &lt;strong>Knowledge in the form of ideation is not going to help.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In true religion ideas alone have no value. In true religion you should know deep within, you should realize God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma is the most important in life. Life is karma. What is awareness? Awareness is knowledge. That is the difference between the two. Human existence is karma + jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Field of karma gives you that wonderful opportunity to get an intimation of that real. Intimation is enough, you need not realize the whole truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>samsari - samyak sarati. Always active. He planes his action based on the results he seeks.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The question comes, who will give the result? You need not perform karma if you could give yourself the result. God will bless me. If god will bless me, why should I do karma at all? Mimamsakas: it is the karma that will bless us. That will work, if karma is the sole cause of the result. But then performing karma correctly should always give the desired result, which is not the case. Or sometimes somebody without karma is getting karmaphala. There must be a thing higher than karma to give the karma phala.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A thing is the way it is only because the universe is the way it is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Causes are countless&lt;/strong>. Effort doesn&amp;rsquo;t determine the outcome. There is a higher power which does.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the power of life in you. If you don&amp;rsquo;t put in effort and just sit in a corner, you&amp;rsquo;ll become a sick person. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ve to put in the effort. But you&amp;rsquo;ve to understand (avadharaya) that the result is not determined by this effort alone.&lt;/strong> The result is determined by the universal reality - God/brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First step: &lt;strong>hands to the work, heart to the god.&lt;/strong> This is karma yoga. This is how mahatmas live.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Karma doesn&amp;rsquo;t give phalam. It would amount to you giving the phalam to yourself. That is the ahamkara.&lt;/strong> Somebody claims he&amp;rsquo;s a self-made person? Ahamkara. He&amp;rsquo;s God made person. &lt;strong>To reach where you&amp;rsquo;re God had to bless you&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surgeon&amp;rsquo;s effort doesn&amp;rsquo;t heal you. It is the higher power manifesting in the body that heals you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The idea that I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for the outcome weights heavily on the people. You&amp;rsquo;re responsible for the karma! Do karma and relax.&lt;/strong> Do the most sincere effort. Some people might like it or not, but leave the rest to the higher power and relax. &lt;strong>Learn to relax.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After karma you&amp;rsquo;ll be physiologically tired. If you think you&amp;rsquo;re responsible for the outcome, you&amp;rsquo;ll be tired psychologically as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Divine madness: putting in all the effort and not worrying about the outcome.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Connect your self to the karma, never ever to the karma phala. In fact, give up karma phala. There is peace immediately.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is karma. But &lt;strong>am I the doer? When there is speaking, speech is happening. Power of life and power of knowledge are responsible for the speech.&lt;/strong> Power of life is given, I&amp;rsquo;m not the author of it. Nor the parents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Language, knowledge are not personal, but universal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Power of life, power of knowledge come from the higher power. I&amp;rsquo;m the conduit for the speech to happen. Is fan going round and round? Or is it made to go round and round?&lt;/strong> Hetu karta (electricity for fan) is the God. And you see it behind everything happening. Do you cook the food or is the food cooked through you?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Become free from the huge burden of responsibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BG 2.47: karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana - you&amp;rsquo;ve every right to work but not expecting fruits of it. Do not focus on the fruits and never be inactive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This upadhi, this conduit is now surrendered to Isvhara. Let ishvara treat it the way he likes. How long he wants to use it? Let him decide. I&amp;rsquo;m not responsible, I&amp;rsquo;m not doer. Now the divine madness is complete.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you can connect the life (of action) to that tat it leads to realization. OTOH if you look at tat from the standpoint of the intellect alone, there is some value in that also, but it is more likely to become intellectual exercise.&lt;/strong> And you&amp;rsquo;re likely to remain stuck there. It can make a good teacher out of you, but not a realized person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every day you are going through the cycle of sukha and dukha. That is the karma phala. If you can connect it to brahman it is not conceptual brahman anymore, it is living brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samatvam is equality. tadatyam is not! It is identity. E.g. 8-2 = 2x3, but 8-2 not ID 2x3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samsarga - undifferentiated association. Pot is blue. That is not ID, but association. Nila is different, ghata is different, but they are stuck together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vishistatvam - togetherness. dAm AnayA.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>akhanda - they appear different but on close examination they are identical.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you carefully examine, you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>sarvajnah. Everything is in your knowledge. Some things are known to you - vidita. The others are avidita. But they are also known to you! Suppose something is not known to you, can you put to avidita/vidita?&lt;/strong> You: not even God cannot be knowing all the things all the time. Believer: but he has the potential to know. That cit and this cat have the same potential. Division is put there out of habit, lack of proper understanding one self and conditioning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You contradict yourself all the time, so much habituated that you don&amp;rsquo;t mind it. &lt;strong>As long as you&amp;rsquo;re a person and the devotee of a personal god, tat tvam asi is not for you.&lt;/strong> Dead letter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vivekananda: examine the god you worship. It is the projection/blossoming of your own inner spirit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as you live in contradictions, you will not realize the truth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aupanishadah and nAstika look alike.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brain, the conditioning, has become a cover for the heart, the endless love you&amp;rsquo;re. &lt;strong>What you call God is in you, only covered.&lt;/strong> Learn to look for God within.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You go out of sleep, first you are aware (of nothing in particular yet), then aham comes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>My prayer is very simple and short, because I value your time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pratyak bodhah - innermost awareness (not knowledge). Primordial awareness (e.g. gold for ornaments). In which there are no parts (advaya), and no change. &lt;strong>Bodha - you cannot know it, you can be it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose you abide in your self and the mind is silent. You&amp;rsquo;ll not experience any second. No sense of division.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ananda - pure awareness, all shanti - quiet. Sukha - pleasure (agitation, restlessness).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is only one way of realising God - as the inner most self. Dismiss all other silly stories. Explain them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you want brahmajnanam? Really? The one who gets brahmajnanam will not be there by the time he gets it. If you&amp;rsquo;re not prepared for that go home and do some work. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste our time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve to want to become a nobody, wholeheartedly. You must want to lose your self. Telugu proverb: I want to be like a goat in a sheep herd. Do you want to be the selfie or the self?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pratyak bodhah - &lt;strong>pure observation without any center.&lt;/strong> You observe and become happy/unhappy - that is the center.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Notice your consciousness and note where there is sense of division or fragmentary thinking.&lt;/strong> Suppose you&amp;rsquo;ve sense of caste identity, doership, jealousy, frustration, anger &amp;hellip; All are based on sense of division and prevent realisation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Only when your life is inspired by love and guided by knowledge you&amp;rsquo;ll have it. First book and then silence. Love without knowledge becomes sentimentality and will destroy you. Knowledge without love makes you a very cruel person, technocrat, monster.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need food for the tummy and food for the intellect. Is that your purpose of studying vaakya vrtti? Should not be. The purpose should be to get rid of the abrahmatvam of the tvam. Do you feel yourself as brahman? Like in sleep, do you feel any want? Any fear? You&amp;rsquo;ve to reproduce it in the waking state.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you know that I is the brahman? Because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to know it. It is divine madness and you would be God. You want to retain your smallness, your abrahmatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Overcome the habit of abrahmatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Go and eat banana, don&amp;rsquo;t desire it.&lt;/strong> Or it will establish you in abrahmatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A child doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a god outside. Why do you need a god outside?&lt;/strong> You feel yourself so small, petty, poor. That&amp;rsquo;s why you need a brahman outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Examine your life how superficial it is. Centered around the body and its needs, comforts, welfare. The mind and its frustration, envy, gratification, attachments, aversions etc. You miss the real depth of tvam padartha all the way.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>paroksha - farawayness (parah+akSa - eyesight). Terrible conditioning coming from puranic literature. Erase it. &lt;strong>God is pratyaksha {prati+akSa}.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami: I&amp;rsquo;m not a temple guy. Not a pauranikah. I&amp;rsquo;m aupanishadah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When mother is alive, you don&amp;rsquo;t need another god. When mother is no more, acharya is. When acarya is no more, entire humanity is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love your neighbour - love entire humanity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no friend, there is no foe. There is only divinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Love of what is not important. Love of all, everything.&lt;/strong> That is god consciousness. Boundary between good and evil is gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose God is not parokSa anymore. Tvam is not abrahma anymore. Then what? Tvam becomes one with the God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>srunu - listen!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Outside there is no fullness. Fullness is in you in the form of unbounded spacious awareness. Find it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To experience any want, you have to come down to the level of the mind.&lt;/strong> All want is in the mind. Once you discover it, even when the mind is there it won&amp;rsquo;t disturb the fullness, you, God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do everything for happiness. As long as you seek it, you&amp;rsquo;ll be away from it. If somebody offers happiness, say &amp;ldquo;thanks no&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>Reach a point of consciousness in which you do not seek.&lt;/strong> Then you&amp;rsquo;ll discover you&amp;rsquo;re the bliss. As long as you seek you&amp;rsquo;re a small guy, abrahman.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>unmatta pralAbhaha - blabbering of a crazy guy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>karmakanda is all vacyarta. In Vedanta it is dismissed right away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you can define brahman, it becomes unpure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When it comes to the matters of inner reality, all conclusions are wrong.&lt;/strong> Same for tvam and tat. Keep it open. Lakshiarta - open-ended meaning. Vacyarta - conclusive meaning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop highlighting the body. Go on negating the ID with the body. I&amp;rsquo;m beyond all this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In tvam pada all the physical things have to be dropped. Then mental things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You arrive at lakshiarta by negation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accommodate it. The symbol is not the thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever you perceive that is not God. And that is not you also. You&amp;rsquo;re what makes perception possible.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tvam and the tat they merge. Tvam doesn&amp;rsquo;t remain tvam anymore, tat doesn&amp;rsquo;t remain tat anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People have problems. The fact that they are still doing religious rituals prove the problems are not solved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ritualization -&amp;gt; losing the sensitivity. Mechanization.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All is god, everything is god. And you see yourself as totally different from body/mind and physical things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pravartate - moving forward&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make a religion you need a separate tat and separate tvam. Otherwise where is the religion? Therefore take tat and add impurities (shabala).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-34httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvslrjqudkhxg">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLrJqUdkhXg">Class 34&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Shankara makes a difference between shabda (word), pratyaya (idea) and vastu (thing outside). Apply to tvam (aham). You have to reach beyond the word and its meaning. Just the word and its idea have no meaning without he vastu. The basis is the sense of myself, being, I&amp;rsquo;m-ness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is the function, work of the braincells. An object throws light upon the eyes and optical sensation happens. That sensation is interpreted by the mind as the thought. The interpretation is called cognition. Cognition is indifferent. When it is made into experience it becomes more important and gets imprinted in the mind.&lt;/strong> Otherwise mind will be deleting the cognitions. Estimated 99 out of 100 are deleted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind records and keeps it so you can pull it out later. &lt;strong>Another name for this memory is mind.&lt;/strong> What you call mind is but thought, past recordings. And all thought originates in memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feeling of the sense of being, I&amp;rsquo;m-ness, is possible only when the atman reflects in the body/mind. In the absence of this reflection atman doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To know tvam, which translates as aham, do you look into the book? To the speaker? Or do you look within?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind projects boredom, because it wants a variety of things. You have to teach the mind to keep quiet.&lt;/strong> You have to understand. Who&amp;rsquo;s your best friend? Atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feeling is deeper than thinking. Feeling is in the heart, thinking in the head. Be a heart person (all love), not head person (all logic). &lt;strong>Prefer love to logic.&lt;/strong> Suppose the other insults you. Love demands try to bless the person. Logic demands revenge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose it is the mind looking at the mind. That is known to whom?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aham - pure awareness in which there is no knowing. Mind knows the object - there is knowing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you go to the jeweler&amp;rsquo;s shop you don&amp;rsquo;t see many things. There is only one thing. Eyes + mind together see many ornaments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Character of mirror: show things that don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/strong> Break it and you&amp;rsquo;ll see. &lt;strong>Mirror doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect no things. It only reflects light.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without mirror, a lense there is no movie. Your eyes are also lenses. You see things that are not there while missing what is.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>tat pada comes with a blemish (shabala) - paroksha. What is aparoksha is taken as paroksha and indicated as tat. &lt;strong>The impurity comes always from the upadhi.&lt;/strong> Upadhi of brahman, is maya. Material cause. Jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you&amp;rsquo;re calling material cause is the same as substantive and constituent cause. Chaitanyam. What you call matter is chaitanyam alone, which appears as matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the jagat side, the substantive cause. From its own side, from karana side it&amp;rsquo;s constituent cause (karya-karana bhava). Both is brahman. Both are the same as the very lose expression - the material cause.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jonih - cause.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maya is the upadhi of brahman, without which which there cannot be apparent division between jiva and brahman, the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vadah - theory. You need the theory of maya to explain the world. In case of maya it&amp;rsquo;s not a theory. It&amp;rsquo;s a statement of fact.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The basis of our life is contradiction.&lt;/strong> Are you life or are you death? &lt;strong>We have to move through these tremendous contradictions, the opposites&lt;/strong>. In Rama you&amp;rsquo;ll find some adharma and in Ravana there is a lot of good too. Death follows life like a shadow follows a person. &lt;strong>Our life moves through these contradictions and maya is the explanation for them.&lt;/strong> Maya is a way of understanding the tremendous contradictions of our lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need not, cannot understand brahman, your self. All you need to understand is maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example: Maya is whirling of &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo;. Maya has to move. Brahman is kutastah, changeless, immobile. In the case of jagat the whirling is replaced by the mind. &lt;strong>Mind is not a thing, it is movement. The thing is chaitanyam.&lt;/strong> This elaborate thing of the power of moving associated with ajnana makes you believe that there is a jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no difference between ajnana and mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t call it avidya when you put maya as the upadhi to brahman. You worship saguna brahman. You do not identify with saguna brahman. Saguna brhama is different and you are different. Maya as avidya would sound bad for worship purpose. So we say maya or shakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Maya is avidya only.&lt;/strong> In fact there is no difference between jiva and brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parokshatvam - provisional division (dinstinction) created between alpajnah jiva and sarvajnah ishvara. Created for worship, for the purpose of overcoming maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To begin with it was personification. So poetic and beautiful but then it became literal. So maya is stri-linga. And there are three gunas in maya. Thus three women. If there is a woman, what is the right thing (in India)? Get married. Man may not marry but a women should. Now there are three. When women marry what they do? Fight among themselves. So sarasvati, laksmi, parvati will be most of the time very friendly but occasionally they fight also. Now there are currents worshiping maya only without shiva (saguna brahman).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve to worship saguna brahman. Maya is included. What is it? The rising sun. Panca bhutas. Need not have a particular shape. The life in every lifeform. Namaste vayo tvam eva pratyaksham brahmasi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brahman is neuter. Maya is the upadhi, not a woman. First you put a woman there and then you say woman should be given priority etc.&lt;/strong> Saguna brahma upasana only should be done. &lt;strong>Once you lose the track and dismiss saguna brahman and hold on to the maya shakti now the ground is ready for an enormous degeneration.&lt;/strong> e.g. vamacara. An enormous degeneration happened in the Hindu dharma. And that division went on and on and on. Women were suppressed and not given proper status, then caste divisions, caste among gods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some muni: &lt;em>I would like to see the entire Hindu society chanting gayatri manta and worshipping saguna brahman in the rising sun.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example: &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo; is not what is there. &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo; is what you see! How come? Maya. Translation Maya = illusory, delusion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose glow (cit of brahman) is not present at something, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even appear.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Maya you cannot entirely explained.&lt;/strong> If you could, it would be not maya anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you don&amp;rsquo;t go to the real of the nama rupa, then your worship loses its purpose.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Do not seek. Why should you seek, when you get things without seeking? Seeking stands in the way as a wall. It perpetuates division, dvaita, duality. &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t seek anything from the world, god, body/mind also.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Immanent - present in all there is. Transcendent - not bound by the nama rupas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In conceptual Vedanta they don&amp;rsquo;t go beyond words.&lt;/strong> Guru said the words and the words are the truth. Why did he say so? Because his guru said.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pravaha - flow of water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to contradictions. We reconcile all contradictions. That&amp;rsquo;s why we remain where we are. &lt;strong>Primary sadhana is absence of contradictions.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Contradiction is the worst obstacle for self realization. Suppose you have contradiction it means you&amp;rsquo;re not very earnest about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There are many professions. People don&amp;rsquo;t want self-realization. They want to become vedantins&lt;/strong> - one more profession..&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There are moments when there is no desire, no fear in your heart. Do you think of god then?&lt;/strong> Because you&amp;rsquo;re the god. Because desiring and fearing upadhi (jiva) is gone.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>You want to give up something? You have to do a 180 degrees turn. Slowly decreasing won&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether you&amp;rsquo;re sanyasi or grhasta, &lt;strong>you suffer because of attachment. You have to understand attachment and come out of it.&lt;/strong> You cannot keep some attachment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddha&amp;rsquo;s teaching is homocentric. Upanishadic teaching is real-centric. Religions are theocentric. In theocentric (puranas, upasanas) you&amp;rsquo;re a soul and god is a bigger soul somewhere else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Primary meaning have no value, are contradictory. Dismiss certain aspects of primary meaning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sah &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; ayam (this). That devadata from there is not this devadata from here and now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>World is jada. If you&amp;rsquo;re jada you&amp;rsquo;re of the world. But you&amp;rsquo;re not of the world, you&amp;rsquo;re only in the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>On the land even you cannot move a boat. Water is the place where boat should be. There even a child can move it. But suppose water is put inside the boat. Then the boat will sink. That is how we sink in life. We put the world in ourselves.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People fail to reach beyond the words. Therefore, when they do and are unable to realize the divinity within they will find other ways. Chant it, do puja, do homa &amp;hellip; - convert it into a ritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conceptual meaning of life (&amp;ldquo;the Plan&amp;rdquo;). That&amp;rsquo;s the only meaning of life we know. This entire meaning of life collapses in time. All of it. Not one bit remains.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You do not wait for the time to end the conceptual framework of life. You end it yourself.&lt;/strong> If you allow the time to end it, it will and your heart will be broken. You&amp;rsquo;ll plunge into darkness. If you do it yourself, &lt;strong>by knowledge, it is called &amp;ldquo;bhaga-tyaga lakshanah&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> - I&amp;rsquo;m not the one who lives. It is the body who lives. Body&amp;rsquo;s achievements, children, lifespan etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever is conceptual is meaningless.&lt;/strong> 80y lifespan, marriage, children, attachment, aversion, worship of gods and goddesses with sense of duality, time, space &amp;hellip; everything that mind can conceive is meaningless. That is bhaga tyaga lakshanah. By doing so you get connected to the reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever your mind conceives is false and whatever it desires is utterly useless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re just aware of the people. You do not look at them as spouse, friend etc. Same for events. Somebody puts a garland upon you. Somebody else throws mud at you. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re just aware.&lt;/strong> Entire conceptual meaning of life is dismantled. The person you imagined yourself to be is gone. And you merge wit the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Things happen one way, you&amp;rsquo;re aware. They happen other way, you&amp;rsquo;re aware. They do not mean anything anymore, they&amp;rsquo;re all meaningless. Only the conceptual mind has given them some meaning, which is utterly useless, which will end. Before it ends, I end it myself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tatvabodha is all head-study. Atmabodha is all heart-study, takes you away from concepts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is better, sravanam or niddidhiasanam? People conveniently forget about mananam. Swami TV: I consider mananam most important. The discussion which of the three is better is wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Superficially there are three sadhanas but essentially there is one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to make your mind less worldly. You cannot keep the mind very worldly and yet hope to accomplish self-realization. How to make mind less wordly? &lt;strong>Shamah - make mind less worldly, damah - keep the organism alert&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you give some nice food to people they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do shravanam. Damah won&amp;rsquo;t be there. &lt;strong>Excessive food consumption makes the organism very dull.&lt;/strong> Damah is very important.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All parokshatvam of God is imagination of theologians. Because for them god is a human being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no reason to make the jiva and the deva separate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ajnana provides tremendous security. Because of the insecurity people don&amp;rsquo;t want to know. In &amp;ldquo;aham brahma asmi&amp;rdquo; there is no security. You will not be secure, you&amp;rsquo;ll be free.&lt;/strong> People prefer to keep the items of the world. Parrot inside the gold cage has security, the wild crane has not. But it entire space belongs to the wild crane, while parrot never knows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human nature: We don&amp;rsquo;t want this to be over. It has to continue. Just like a hospital is not interested in all people being healthy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ajnana is convenient. Jnana is most inconvenient of all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You create falsehood all round you. &lt;strong>Falsehood provides security.&lt;/strong> You seek security, so long &amp;ldquo;aham brahma asmi&amp;rdquo; keeps at a distance. Sri Ramakrishna: &lt;strong>aham brahma asmi is like you&amp;rsquo;re holding to a branch of a tree. You stop holding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Giving up takes no time, if you really want to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What you&amp;rsquo;re giving up is not real. And the real you cannot give up anyway.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re giving up nama rupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need some quality sravanam, then quality mananam that inspirates and uplifts you. And that niddidhiasanam - be aware of what is going in your mind, of its movement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep god universal, don&amp;rsquo;t make him South-Indian.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are ready to believe anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once you become a group person, your self-realization is out.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re suffering because of ignorance, because your understanding is wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When somebody dies I never grieve. For me death is death of the body and the person is merged in Isvhara. What is there to grieve about it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Examine and make a list of all different elements of bondage which cause suffering. And then dismiss all of them. &lt;strong>(recap) That is what you have to do by understanding the vision with the help of an acarya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-39httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkaexw0fv0qo">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAexW0Fv0qo">Class 39&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What happened in Hinduism is that we&amp;rsquo;re left with the acaryas and we lost the shruti. When that happens, the entire religion goes to the wrong direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shruti is the vision.&lt;/strong> Acarya is only presenting the vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why do the students give so much importance to the outer &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo;? Because the guru does. Sad. The guru should lead dismissing the outer self (shadow). That invisible inner self cannot be seen with the eyes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The one who says god and jiva are different he will not take much time to say you and I are different. And then he&amp;rsquo;ll say I&amp;rsquo;m superior and you&amp;rsquo;re inferior.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The body identified self tries to derive some advantage/glory out of a name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Root cause of samsara: outer self pursuing a thing or not. Also, check if you&amp;rsquo;re anxious. That belongs to the outer self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are childish. Just like them they take things very literally. Amrta is not liquid. Amrta is amrtatvam, status of one&amp;rsquo;s true nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are waiting for death. When you create time for yourself (I&amp;rsquo;m young, old, 30 years old, etc.), you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for death. If death is today, you don&amp;rsquo;t wait for it, you face it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who hope for knowledge in future will not get knowledge at all. They will get only death. There is only one thing certain in future - death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amrta is absence of psychological death. You step of net of time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Farmers grows a plant to get crop. Landscaping people are cutting the plants for no reason. Doing a lot of himsa. Same for hunting people. There is only one life-form in the creation that hunts for entertainment. A cow doesn&amp;rsquo;t destroy grass if it is not hungry (Don Juan - don&amp;rsquo;t take more then required / greed).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I close the door cautiously, I put the book, use the mask &amp;hellip; carefully. The same self is present everywhere. Use it when and how appropriate.&lt;/strong> This is how the one who knows the invisible inner self looks at the world around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People resist. They&amp;rsquo;re not open. They do not have clarity of thinking. They are conditioned. They&amp;rsquo;re a bunch of conditioned clowns. Be harsh if necessary, that is the labour of love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>acarya prasAdena - by the love of acarya&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bodhah - understanding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any ending, whatever it is that ends, you&amp;rsquo;re liberated.&lt;/strong> In the moments of ending there is bliss. Anything, in good and bad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramanamaharshi: &lt;strong>do you have a mind? That is avidya.&lt;/strong> You do not depend on the mind upon the truth. Your mind can only block the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is freedom from something, e.g. sorrow. And there is a higher version, just freedom - freedom absolute. And both are your own - svarupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnana is not visible. Only ajnana is visible.&lt;/strong> Unless you study and examine a person for a long time you can&amp;rsquo;t tell.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only ajnanis are anxious. &lt;strong>Jnani is not anxious. He knows that he&amp;rsquo;s not the body/mind. The mind will take care of the body by laws of nature.&lt;/strong> Body is thirsty, mind will find water. When there is hunger, food will come. When there is illness, medicine will come. &lt;strong>How? Mind will work out something. Jnani knows this and need not interfere with it.&lt;/strong> The only difference in this context between jnani and ajnani is utter lack of anxiety.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All rituals are result of anxiety.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-40httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv168jhdakhna">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=168jhDakHNA">Class 40&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You identify with the organs of action, you become karta. If with the sense organs, you become bhotka. These three (w. mind too) are totally gone for a jnani. &amp;ldquo;My body&amp;rdquo; is an idea. Body doesn&amp;rsquo;t say it. For him, it is &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; body and &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; mind, not &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnani is not a karta. What needs to be done it gets done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose there is a desire. You&amp;rsquo;re acutely conscious of the desire, whereas you&amp;rsquo;re not of so many things of the physiological and psychological functions of the system. Now you want the desire to be fulfilled, for that you do karma, wait for the karma-phala, create psychological time and get bound.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnani is not afraid of death, he&amp;rsquo;s not afraid of life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnani lives a quiet life and quiet death. Quiet is happy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why not death be a simple thing. It should be a simple affair. It should not be an enormous burden on the people left behind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnanis do not create vasanas in their hearts. Advantage is one is free to love. &lt;strong>You need to be free to love&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For a jnani only, there will be agama karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sancita karma and agami karma are destroyed for the jnani. Even prarabda karma is not there for jnani, it&amp;rsquo;s there for the body/mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnani = absence of a self-conscious person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If the person is not liberated before death, it will not be liberated after death.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vega = momentum. Prarabda karma has a momentum. In life, everything is a moment. It is a flow. It has a velocity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prarabdha will take you forward in the life till that momentum becomes zero and the body falls.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kevalasya bhavaha = kaivalyam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There are no others for a jnani. All others getting moksha is ridiculous. Double ajnana: I&amp;rsquo;m ajnani and all others are ajnanis. There are no others. There is no second at any time.&lt;/strong> Who&amp;rsquo;s left? I&amp;rsquo;m. Kaivalyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What you see on the screen is in you. Where is she? On the screen or in you? Dance? Music? In you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When everything ends, you&amp;rsquo;re there.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kaivalyam is same as Vishnu. In Vedas there is only all-pervading reality, which is brahman. &amp;ldquo;Vishnu sahasrama&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;Bhagavan&amp;rsquo;s sahasranama&amp;rdquo; and Vishnu is one of the names. Vaishnavas made it into &amp;ldquo;Vishnu sahasranama&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parama pada - supreme goal, abode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is something always better. Then the following happens 1) The joy we&amp;rsquo;re getting melts away when you a better thing 2) the joy that you&amp;rsquo;ve derived from a given objects stops giving the joy because of the law of diminishing returns 3) it becomes monotonous.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monotonous -&amp;gt; no joy. There is only one joy - ananda. Which is you get moksha. You get into sarvaatmabhaava. This jnani gets that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vaishnavam - belonging to Vishnu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Satyam is the truth as ascertained by the study of the scriptures. Living, practicing it is called rtam. What you&amp;rsquo;ve learned from the scriptures you live in life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Small prakarana by Shankaracarya&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pravaha - flow, activity, current.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it comes to knowledge, there no division between east and west.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nature of work is grow, until it occupies all free time you have.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is the means that shapes the end. You won&amp;rsquo;t get the end independent of the means&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If bhakti is separates from philosophy, it becomes superstitious. Religion loses its transforming power.&lt;/strong> Society comes into focus, not individual liberation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We rise above literality of the mythology and rise to the spirit. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is called spirituality. If you take them literally, you once again fall into the trap of establishing division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The rishis love to cloud the truth in a symbolic language. Instead of telling that sun&amp;rsquo;s white light can be split into seven colours, the mantras say that &amp;ldquo;he travels by a chariot pulled by seven horses&amp;rdquo;. sa:sapti - horse, ray of light.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Serpent going and eating part of the sun - shadow. It covers up part of the sun or the moon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In all this stories the literality has to be appreciated and spirit must be understood correctly. Then only there is beauty in those stories.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kashi - atmajnanam in this context.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:nija - self&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m is the most fundamental experience of every human being. It is prior to everything else, incl. god.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m is the primordial intelligence. &amp;ldquo;God is&amp;rdquo; is not, neither &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the matrix of I&amp;rsquo;m? Conscious being. That conscious being is the Kashi - because it is self-shining. You validate the existence of all objects. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m-ness&amp;rdquo; is svayamprakasha - it is prior to perception and thinking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Body makes you limited in space, mind in time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If god is a limited guy, he can have only one center. If he&amp;rsquo;s spherical. If he&amp;rsquo;s elipsoid, he can have two. Whereas every human heart is the center of God. He&amp;rsquo;s infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Most important, sacred spot in Kashi is the place where bodies are burned.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You will not be able to invite the truth. It will reveal itself. You only have to prepare yourself for the revelation. The preparation is negation of the identification with the body, which is threefold: me, mine, for me. aham mama mahyam.&lt;/strong> Mahyam gets neutralised by karma yoga. Mama, things related to me, are neutralised by bhakti yoga. Everything is of Ishvara, nothing is mine. In bhakti namah (na mama) is the most important thing. Aham karta is negated by sankhya yoga -&amp;gt; nirahamkara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without crucification there can be no resurrection.&lt;/strong> What resurrects is the Christ who is one with the God - myself and father in the heaven are one and the same. How to do? Begin with namahyam. Then namama.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upashanti: shanti shanti shanti is 3x because there are three kinds of papas. Adhiatmika, adhibauthika, adhidaivika. Each papam is a fire, heat, pain, suffering. Shanti douses all three of them. The heart is at peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But Real shanti is not upashanti. It is parashanti, moksha. &lt;strong>Permanent freedom from suffering - nirvana. It is a negative word. It is not a positive definition. I cannot say what it is itself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Silence per se is not important. When the mind is moving, the flow of thoughts is harmless if you know that the content of the mind is unreal.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You psychologically depend on that content of waking consciousness for self-fulfillment and happiness and take it to be other. It is a very far and deep ignorance. It can give me sukha and dukha and therefore to have more sukha and less dukha I have to manipulate the content. The flow of mind throws a screen of thought over the truth which is then totally covered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to discover the truth deep within so you can compare it to the mind created world. The mind creates a world for us and presents it to us every day morning. We&amp;rsquo;re accepting that world and take it to be real and ourselves to be a small part of the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rather than taking up the struggle to discover the truth ourselves it is very convenient to handle the responsibility for the truth to the mahatma and start relaxing. How do you know that jagat is mithya? Sastra says that &amp;hellip; c&amp;rsquo;mon! How long will you manage like this? Therefore gain the paramopashanti. That is the real kashi. You get by manonivrtti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose I see a pot. &lt;strong>Now I pay attention to the pot. And now I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the pot. That makes the pot real. While paying attention and investing interest cannot say a thing is mithya.&lt;/strong> Stop paying attention and interest and see what happens. That is called manonivrtti. Just watch your mind in an uninvolved way. Be kind to it. Do it constantly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>De-automatize everything. Like stop talking when you are eating food. Because if you are talking, eating becomes automatic and the attention is on talking and there is identification.&lt;/strong> It is the mind that is functioning through the taste-buds. Just watch it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Just watch the mind. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask how. Suppose you find an agitation in the mind. When the mind is agitated I&amp;rsquo;m agitated. That is called identification. There is no viveka (between I&amp;rsquo;m and the mind). I&amp;rsquo;m and I think are not the same. When you watch the mind it becomes pure. Slowly. Once the mind is pure you&amp;rsquo;ll know very spontaneously that you&amp;rsquo;re not the mind but the witness of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transcending the mind means knowing that I&amp;rsquo;m not the mind, antahkarana. Antahkarana suddhi is the most important starting point.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>That silence is conscious presence. It is not a gap, it is not void. It is the kashi. In Kashi there is a flow of ganga.&lt;/strong> Ganga is pure and also purifying. In the Kashi which is in my heart, the Ganga is jnanapravaha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m the primordial light/intelligence. &lt;strong>The moment body comes into the light the world also comes. They always come together and resolve together.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The light is the atmajnanu. The brilliantly shining awareness. The Kashi. And the playfulness (vilasa) of the mind is the film.&lt;/strong> Steven Spielberg knows it, that&amp;rsquo;s why he called his company Dreamworks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The world you experience is entirely, not partly, a projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever is the content of consciousness&lt;/strong>, whatever is known to you as part of that content, &lt;strong>that is not I&amp;rsquo;m.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m is unknown, unknowable, undefinable, undesignated, undifferentiated, primordial awareness of being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t want money, wife and children &amp;hellip; what you&amp;rsquo;re seeking in life is happiness. You&amp;rsquo;ve a right to seek it. Seeking is right, but the method is wrong. You don&amp;rsquo;t seek happiness in the other. The other is maya and kalpita (imaginary). You see a movie and feel good. Where do you get that feeling of goodness? From the screen it flows to you? No, from you it flows onto the screen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discover it: be sat cit. Then discover the fullness of that. Then &lt;strong>as you discover it, the screen of thought projected by the mind will slowly move away. And the inner silence starts flowing into the life and makes it sacred, joyful.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say I&amp;rsquo;m rich you&amp;rsquo;re deriving the sense of self from the riches. When you say I&amp;rsquo;m the husband you&amp;rsquo;re deriving the sense of self from your status. That&amp;rsquo;s wrong. Be the love of the husband. &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t derive the sense of self from anything that you know.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t have any identification what so ever.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mahatmas find it so hard to identify with anything. Samsaris people readily identify with anything what-so-ever. Be a true nobody, not somebody, then the real self shines in all its glory.&lt;/strong> It is called paramatmarupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>soham - I&amp;rsquo;m that. That reality. You cannot describe it. The truth is so simple and so profound that language cannot reach it. Truth is not linguistic, truth is existential.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The word that can be used to indicate it - Om.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma, as it reflects in body/mind, the reflection appears as sakshi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manifestation is always the contact. Contact of the infinite (sakshi) with the finite (koshash). Electricity coming into contact with the filament of the bulb appears as the glow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose somebody speaks good or bad things about you. And you just smile and are ready to happily bless both. Then you&amp;rsquo;re free&lt;/strong> from the bondage - samsara bandha - ashiva - amangala. From the bondage of opposites: punya papa, shubaashuba&amp;hellip; All dvandvas bind us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every identifications presents us as a victim to opposites.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Just be a sakshi. Uninvolved, uninterested, unperturbed witnessing awareness.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t get caught in opposites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Job of the sword can&amp;rsquo;t be done as long as it is in the sheet.&lt;/strong> Its glory is covered as long as it is in the sheet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is bondage only when you make the fundamental, original mistake of identification. The mistake that amounts to a sin. The name for it is maya, avidiya in the context of individual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Why are you living? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Just because I&amp;rsquo;m living doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m seeking to live. If Bhagavan decides to put an end to this live at this moment it is OK with me.&lt;/strong> With this attitude there is no boktrtva, no identification with the mental/intellectual sheath.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Annamaya is not the bondage. Identifying with it is the mistake. If you&amp;rsquo;re the body then you won&amp;rsquo;t know the body. But you know the body. Eyes can&amp;rsquo;t see themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pot thought is known to I. I&amp;rsquo;m aware of the pot-thought. I&amp;rsquo;m not the pot-thought. I&amp;rsquo;m a realm of intelligence behind the thought. There is no logic identifying with the thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Money lost, nothing is lost. Time is lost, something is lost. Character is lost, all is lost.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mistake is cognitive, mental. It is the cognitive faculty called buddhi, that is underlying all this five-fold mistake.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignorant-mind is (called) avidya. Avidya is the buddhi. This avidya is none other than bhavani. Cosmic avidya is called maya, bhavani. In every body this mistake is repeating again and again. Every individual is doing this mistake of identifying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can turn the avidya to your advantage by identifying with the shiva. &lt;strong>Shiva is the purusha. Prakuruti is the buddhi, maya, bhavani.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>bhavasya (spirit) patni (wife) - bhavani.&lt;/strong> bhavam samsarinam karoti iti bhavani. &lt;strong>She makes Ishvara, Shiva a samsari.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be a witness to the vital force, mind, buddhi, to all enjoyment. Don&amp;rsquo;t become enjoyer. When you identify with the enjoyment, then you become an enjoyer.&lt;/strong> Be a witness to the ego, it won&amp;rsquo;t be able to survive. Every movement of ego you just watch. It becomes pure, right ego. Only the ego that has become strong because of identification hurts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In kashi there is shiva (bhava) and bhavani. Shivasya patni - shivA. Bhavasya - patni bhavani. Rudrasya patni - rudrAni. &lt;strong>Sakshi is shiva. Sakshya the five-fold upadhi is the bhavani.&lt;/strong> All bondage is placed the moment you identify.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any-seeker who knows this kashi gains the kashi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4LlgTU8F-s&amp;amp;t=2608s">Shambavi mudra meditation&lt;/a>: &lt;em>Keep eyes open. Stop blinking for a while. Understand I&amp;rsquo;m not seeking what is in-front of me. I&amp;rsquo;m aware of the inner only. I focus the entire eye-sight in the center of the eye-brows. I&amp;rsquo;m watchful of the center of the eye-brows. There is a watcher and the watched and eventually I become the watchfulness itself. That is called the kashi. Now the awareness instead of being focused on the things is focused on itself. That is the kashi. That is you. You are not what comes to light in that kashi. That is the ego.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The awareness is the Shiva and the center (between the eyebrows) is the kashi. Shivoham.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is the movement of the mind that creates the entire content. Through ignorance the mind gives reality to its own creation. As long as you have interest in the content, attachment to the content, so long you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to discover the inner silence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kashi ksetram shariram - city of Kashi is entire body. In Kashi you have Ganga. Ganga flows in three lokas. In heavens, earth, netherworld. Tribhuvanam vyapini ganga. Here the ganga is jnanaganga - manifest conciousness. It also flows in three lokas - waking, dream, deep sleep state.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three states (waking, dream, sleep) are called sthAna. The consciousness lights up all of them. Yet one doesn&amp;rsquo;t acquire sthAna dharma. One doesn&amp;rsquo;t get married/attached to them - identified with the sthAnas. Disassociate with it. Example: &lt;strong>day, night, twilight do they happen to the sun? They just happen as the earth moves around the sun.&lt;/strong> Nothing ever happens to you. You&amp;rsquo;re the forth, the primordial intelligence. That turiya is the Shiva. That turIya is the Isha of vishva - entire universe (all what you see, smell, touch &amp;hellip;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Content of the waking consciousness is the vishva. You&amp;rsquo;re the master of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tIrtha - place that purifies you, road, ascetic, preceptor, channel.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Message of hindu dharma to the entire humanity can be summarised by this single verse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IshAvAsyaM idaM sarvaM - all this is pervaded by God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>anta - essence, end. Vedanta - essence of Veda. Essence comes at the end, just like dessert.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pramA - correct knowledge, correct understanding. Vedanta - means of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Veda is a body of knowledge, collections of words that help us to know. Thus it is a means of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Human being is a knowing entity. You cannot but know.&lt;/strong> You cannot help it. Like a flower that cannot help but spread fragrance all around. &lt;strong>Knowledge is the most important thing.&lt;/strong> Human being is essentially the life and capacity to know. Body is the instrument for expression of life. Suppose there is no life the body is a cadaver and not worth keeping around. It is the life and knowledge that is the essence of a human being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma + jnanam = human being. Jnanam is more important. Action which is not supported by knowledge becomes blind action. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t glorify anobody.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Life (vitality) and light (knowledge) is a human being.&lt;/strong> Light of knowledge is the most important.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human being is endowed with &lt;strong>means of knowledge: pratyaksha - perception, anumana - inference.&lt;/strong> They make the process of knowing possible. In the case of animals they are less developed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The entire science is based on inference. Electron itself is inference only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowledge obtained through perception or inference is not enough to give fulfilment though. Can&amp;rsquo;t answer most fundamental question: What am I? What is God? What is the world? While perception and inference will help us to understand the world to an extent, they cannot provide correct information on real nature of the world. Perception and inference are just useful to lead some life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can gain an understanding about those important things using the source of knowledge called Veda. &lt;strong>Veda throws light on these areas which remain hidden from perception and inference.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human life is nothing but karma and jnanam. Accordingly the body of knowledge - Veda - is divided into these two areas. A human being cannot but act. Thus the first part of Veda deals with karma - how to channelize it into a higher goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Capitalism and communism appear opposite but have the same materialistic premise. Artha and kama. Therefore there is one more, most important aspect of life. &lt;strong>Dharma - moderation, which includes legality and morality&lt;/strong> of earning money. Dharma is appropriate action, composing the karma kandha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Action definitively attracts result. But &lt;strong>when action is performed with knowledge, the result will be more glorious.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In life all suffering has its origin in the smaller picture. I&amp;rsquo;m so and so and I have my job, my family, my credit card. Everybody needs a smaller picture, even a sadhu. But one should at least pay some attention to the bigger picture - &lt;strong>mystery of the world (jagat), essence of what am I (jiva), ultimate reality/origin (ishvara)? An understanding of the bigger picture makes mind fulfilled. Any time you gain a little bit of happiness you have knowingly or unknowingly transported yourself into the bigger picture.&lt;/strong> When you come again into the smaller picture, you make yourself sorrowful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>upa - approaching close, going near. shad - destroy. As you approach the body of knowledge it destroys ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowledge cannot help you in getting anything directly. It won&amp;rsquo;t buy you a coke. But it can remove ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnwde-1vwu6y">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWde-1vWU6Y">Class 2&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sat, cit, ananda. These alone are one thing only.&lt;/strong> Suppose you are speaking about a tasty, fragrant, most enjoyable thing - ladhu. It is only one thing. Similarly &lt;strong>there is only one reality.&lt;/strong> Sat &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; mrtyu, cit &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; ajnana, ananda &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; dukha. &lt;strong>What alone is death that is suffering, ignorance.&lt;/strong> Suppose you take care of ignorance you&amp;rsquo;ve taken care of death and suffering. &lt;strong>In knowledge there is no death and suffering. Correctly you&amp;rsquo;d be most afraid of ignorance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In jnanam there is no belief. There is only understanding. Understanding brings out terrific amount of hidden energy. There is infinite potential in every human being. You&amp;rsquo;re potentially divine, infinite. You do not know your worth. You&amp;rsquo;ve misunderstood yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is nothing as sacred, as valuable as knowledge.&lt;/strong> It is the only thing important in life, everything else is secondary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Highest disadvantage of technological advances is obesity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disenchantment is a very important aspect of human life. Mind sees toys and gets excited when it gets it and then gets annoyed and seeks for more. &lt;strong>Nobody can satisfy the mind by fulfilling the desires.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the theologies of the world have a stamp of superstition on their face. To an extend they can relieve a tired human mind, but they fail to bring lasting peace. They cause more problems than the good they bring to one&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the single factor responsible for largest amount of violence in social life? Religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as science, religion and philosophy are not integrated it is a danger. &lt;strong>Science and religion can serve us better only when they are integrated by philosophy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schopenhauer: in the whole world there is no study as beneficial as the study of upanishads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without knowledge of the upanishads life can be a burden. Fear of death and struggle of livening cannot be handled with knowledge of the world only. It is not enough to face death with a smile on the face.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isha - by Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Newtons vision of the world - mechanistic. The world is a huge machine consisting of totally separated parts, objects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In theology, how the idea of space and time are explained? In theology, the effort is made to understand the known (world) starting from the unknown (god). Nietzche: God is death. When a theologian says &amp;ldquo;A god in heaven created the world I can similarly say he&amp;rsquo;s death&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In Decarte&amp;rsquo;s philosophy spirit and matter are totally divided realms. Then add Newtonian world view and theology with a monocratic creator god in heaven to that. Division is complete.&lt;/strong> Everybody and everything is divided from each other. &lt;strong>Isavasya idam sarvam in one stroke negates this.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as our world-view is based on division there will be no end to conflict and violence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjrwkurxe3ye">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRWkuRXE3YE">Class 3&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Decartes: a person is what his mind is. We identify ourselves so totally with the mind that we lose touch with the reality about ourselves. Joke: Decartes not able to choose from the menu disappears after answering &amp;ldquo;I think not&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;do you know what you chose?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Division is established because our total identification with the mind.&lt;/strong> In such vision there is no solution for the problems, conflicts and turmoil of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Body is glorious manifestation of universal power called Ishvara. Glory of the body is beyond words.&lt;/strong> Any organ reflects the glory of the universal power so wonderfully. We fail to recognise that glory within ourselves. &lt;strong>We do not identify ourselves entirely with the total organism only with few ideas, with the ego.&lt;/strong> Thus we lose communion with the Ishvara. &lt;strong>Mind has separated from the body and now it tries to control the body.&lt;/strong> Body doesn&amp;rsquo;t need desert, it is the mind that goes for it. In this way we&amp;rsquo;ve developed a conflict between the body and the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For us &lt;strong>nature is there&lt;/strong> to be exploited not &lt;strong>to be observed and worshiped.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Philosophy of division formulated by Decartes and classical Newtonian physics have downed an era for technological development which has proved to be disaster for environment and social ethos. Parallel to this there is the vision of monarchic God living in heaven enforcing the divine upon these hapless masses and the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is entirely opposite to this vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vision of Isavasya upanishad: &lt;strong>God is everywhere. It is not a matter of belief or faith&lt;/strong>, like God in heaven, to which we have to submit ourselves based on revelation by a divine messenger or messiah. It is a belief system, there is no consensus about the messiah. &lt;strong>Isavasya idam sarvam is a matter of understanding.&lt;/strong> In vedanta we talk of visualising Ishvara and understanding Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Word God has an undesirable connotation. It refers to an gentlemen in the heaven. I&amp;rsquo;m here, my uncle is there and god is in heaven. With this understanding you can&amp;rsquo;t deal with the statement of Isavasya idam sarvam, thus &lt;strong>we prefer the word Ishvara. If it needs to be translated, we use Godhead.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A theologian starts from the unknown and tries to explain the known in the terms of the unknown. He constructs a verbal structure (system) and tries to fit everything known into it. He&amp;rsquo;s a prisoner of his verbal structure.&lt;/strong> So the world was created 5000 years and the fossils were put there by god to fool us. This is how theologians and politicians function. &lt;strong>Whereas in philosophy we start from the known and try to understand the unknown.&lt;/strong> This is brahmasutra method in trying to understand Ishvara. We start with &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; and from it we try to visualize the unknown which is Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A worldly person is not interested in the unknown. He only is in the known and he lives his entire life in trying to manipulate it to his advantage. &lt;strong>There is no lasting solution in the known, only in the unknown.&lt;/strong> What is all known is unreal. Whatever is known to you is mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unknown means not available for perception and inference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before arriving at the principle called Ishvara we&amp;rsquo;ve to understand &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; world a little better. Every object is a karyam, effect. In has a beginning and end in time. Pot, mountain, sun, the entire universe is a product. Galaxies are like spots on a balloon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scientist calculated the universe to be 4.5 billions years old based on the expansion of galaxies discovered by Hubble. BG 8th chapter or Bhagavatam dvitiya dhyaya say, there are four yugas. Basic unit is &lt;strong>kaliyuga: 432 000 years&lt;/strong>. Double is dvapara, triple is treta, four times is krta. &lt;strong>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10x. 4.32 mio years is one mahayuga. 1000 mahayugas is one kalpa,&lt;/strong> one cycle of creation. Thus based on Hindu scriptures the universe is 4.32 billions years old.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Rshis knew this is an expanding universe and that&amp;rsquo;s why they called it brahmANDa - brahma (expanding) - aNDa (egg -&amp;gt; elliptical). Elliptical form is more stable than spherical.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every effect must have an cause. You cannot have a product and claim it has no cause. There is material and efficient cause. A sentient person, desiring person. Desire is important. It is the desire that is the cause of the creation of pot. &lt;strong>In vedic vision all creation has its origin in a desire. That&amp;rsquo;s why in the upanishadic statements talking about creation the word kama is always used&lt;/strong>. A desire cannot be there without a desiring individual. A desire is the faculty of a concious being. Therefore he&amp;rsquo;s the efficient cause of a pot. The universe also must have two causes. For vedanta for the universe the two causes are not different, but one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you say god in heaven created the universe you&amp;rsquo;ve already ignored the concept of space.&lt;/strong> Universe includes the concept of space. Space, time, material of the universe cannot be absolute because they would acquire the status of Ishvara and thus create parallel reality. &lt;strong>Time, space, object are one package. Always together.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before creation, there was no space, no time. There is a reality which has manifested as space, time and also the material universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcwk2qv_ys60">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwK2QV_ys60">Class 4&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ishvara is the material source (prakuruti) of creation also.&lt;/strong> It is a challenge to relate to this idea. A lazy mind can accept a faith. A mind ready to think can accept this challenge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All religious beliefs of mankind of all times have understood Ishvara as all-powerful (sarvajna) and all-knowing (sarvashakti). Also &lt;strong>sarvabhavana - all-being. The painter is in the painting.&lt;/strong> We&amp;rsquo;re not talking about an external ishvara. We&amp;rsquo;re talking about intrinsic Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The entire variety of the universe has its origin in one single non-dual reality. What you call energy is appearing as matter and vice-versa. Like one actor in two roles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maker and matter are one. One without a second. Ishvara. Matter + intelligence + power. In a theological mind god is bahiryami - external to the creation and exposing laws from above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:tantra = structure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brhadaranyaka upanishad presents &lt;strong>Ishvara as antaryami. He&amp;rsquo;s everywhere.&lt;/strong> yat sarveshu bhuteshu tishthan, sarvebhyo bhutebyah antarA.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Chemistry or physics model of the universe ignores the observer. Vedanta model of the universe takes the observer into account.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In vedantic model the universe is what you see, touch, smell, taste, hear. &lt;strong>All the five correspondent elements are called bhutas and Ishvara is antaryami in all these.&lt;/strong> antar -&amp;gt; enter, entry. When you worship Ishvara without recognising this fact your worship is incomplete.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The entire universe is the body of Ishvara.&lt;/strong> This is how the fact of Ishvara being antaryami is presented.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a seed. This &lt;strong>seed has an intelligence to manifest as a sprout, then stem, branches, roots, leaves, flowers, fruits&amp;hellip; All that intelligence and power is inside the seed. Intrinsic to the seed. Not in heaven.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People want to know future. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from somewhere else. The future of the flower is encoded in the flower itself. Similarly, the intelligence, the power, the material is there where the universe there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The future of an object is within the object. The reality of an object is within the object. And that reality is Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagine how much energy is released upon splitting an atom. Where does it come from? Outside?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A true devotee is one who consistently wonders at the glory of Ishvara. &lt;strong>Every particle of the universe signals Ishvara to you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Special creation, out of nothing, is not acceptable to Hindu philosophy. Indian philosophers are evolutionists, not creationists. Manifestationists in fact (manifestation over a time scale is evolution).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pakistan - holy land.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example for advaiya (one without the second) is space. Ishavara is one without the second.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are interested in names. Water, pani, aqua &amp;hellip; do they mean different things? Same for Ishvara. People care for names, not for the thing itself. &lt;strong>Name is meaningful only as long as it signals a thing to you.&lt;/strong> If it is disassociated it loses its meaning. You can drop it as well then.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ranga give an example for an amphibian! Frog. Very well. Give another example for an amphibian! Another frog&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Human being is an amphibian. You live in a world of matter, life, consciousness (in Ishvara) as a person. That is one world. But we don&amp;rsquo;t live in this world. There is another world. World of names and forms.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m an Indian in America. White/black. Male/female.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re totally ignorant of the fundamental unity and talk as though the differences as real. In fact this &lt;strong>division is so deeply engrained in our psyche that we cannot think without bringing the gender into the picture.&lt;/strong> There is only life, matter, consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2zzwqrxc8j0">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZzwQrxc8J0">Class 5&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our world is a very subjective world. It has nothing to do with the reality. It is manufactured from our imaginations, likes, dislikes, mental weaknesses. What ever is within, that is the raw material. We project that world outside. We have to shake that world vision.&lt;/strong> Nobody else fits within that world vision. And nobody else holds on to the same world vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every description of a world has a signature.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other observer-based model: The world consists of five elements corresponding to our five sense organs. Every object of this world, living or not living, consists of a combination from these only. We have to reduce the infinite number of the objects of the world for the sake of understanding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as you cling to the idea that only names and forms are real, the way reality behind them won&amp;rsquo;t be recognised. Names and forms are empty shells. &lt;strong>It is the falsehood that binds us. Truth never binds anybody.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The five elements are the same reality. Undivided, invisible existence absolute. The same godhead is behind most subtle akasha and most gross prthivi. There are not five different things only one thing appearing as five&lt;/strong> by the method of tapering. Just like ice, water, steam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Universe is just like jeweller&amp;rsquo;s shop. The same gold (&amp;ldquo;IS&amp;rdquo;-ness) is behind all the items. We miss the IS and hold to the name and form. Example: &amp;ldquo;What is there? Hand. And now? Nothing.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re only conscious of the hand and lose sight of the light and space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where the necklace IS there is gold. It&amp;rsquo;s not like necklace is here and gold in heaven. Isavasyam idam sarvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is life all around us and all life is Ishvara. Ishvara has eyes, legs, heads &amp;hellip; everywhere. All are his. There is no trees standing around - only Ishvara. There are no humans going around - only Ishvara. There are no rivers flowing around - only Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Entire universe is the temple and every life-forms is glorious manifestation of Ishvara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For a theologian god is definitively not here. It&amp;rsquo;s impractical to have god all the time around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:kanya = young unmarried lady.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If lose the spirit and hold on to the customs it is like holding to an empty shell and losing the kernel. In Hindu culture every symbol reflects the all-pervasive nature of god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inner-most reality of the pot is IS-ness, daivam, Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re the knowledge,&lt;/strong> knowingness, conscious being. That&amp;rsquo;s why knowledge of pot happens. It means &lt;strong>you the consciousness has modified into the form of pot knowledge and so it takes place. In every cognition the essential matrix of that knowledge is consciousness and that is God. It is in your heart.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You want to touch god? Just touch any object only. God is all around. There is nothing other than god. This is god-consciousness. There are many aspects of this God. Jiva, jagat, Ishvara. Who&amp;rsquo;s the seeker? I. Who&amp;rsquo;s the seeing? I. Who is the speaker? I. Who is the person that walks? I. &lt;strong>The &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;, the godhead, has many aspects called a devata&lt;/strong> - idol, godhead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is so much wealth, beauty in the creation. It is Ishvara&amp;rsquo;s. It is Ishvara manifested.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can never think of Vishnu without Lakshi. Never of Shiva without Shakti. God has no gender. God of knowledge - sarasvati. In the Veda presented as sarasvan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ultimate truth. I&amp;rsquo;m not ever separate of Ishvara. I&amp;rsquo;m the whole, I&amp;rsquo;m sarvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While desiring a thing, you&amp;rsquo;re going against your salt - your essential nature. Suppose a millionaire is begging for 10 dollars. Is it the appropriate thing to do? He&amp;rsquo;s denying his own reality, his own status! &lt;strong>Wanting - unless something comes from outside to us, we cannot be happy. It only manifests the inner lacking. There is nothing that you need, lack, need to be afraid of in this world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every time you&amp;rsquo;re afraid, you desire something, you&amp;rsquo;re going against your own nature.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re harming yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Menu: where there are too many items, you cannot enjoy anything. When there is only one item, you discover a wonderful thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You can look at every situation in a positive way or in a negative way. Every situation has two sides.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desirelessness is fullness and complete happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Philologists are also political people :). Swami TV: I feel English originated from Sanskrit. Greed - gRDhah. Geriatry - jara. Spy - spasha. Mother - mata. Brother - bhrata.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The entire universe is not enough to fulfill the greed of one person. Yet it is enough to fulfill the needs of all lifeforms.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t be greedy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should carefully look into our heart and pluck out all the wrong ideas. Under any circumstances we should not fall prey to the weakness of mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One should carefully grow into god / cosmic consciousness. One should not stay a prisoner of local consciousness - I&amp;rsquo;m a human being, I identify with physical body, go after my likes and run away from my dislikes. And if God helps me with this, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind praying to him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sahasranama: &lt;strong>primary name is &amp;ldquo;Om&amp;rdquo;. Every other is secondary. &amp;ldquo;Om&amp;rdquo; is a cosmic sound and bhagavan is a cosmic person.&lt;/strong> Mind has a fancy for variety so you can add some other name, but original name is &amp;ldquo;Om&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Namah - &amp;ldquo;na me&amp;rdquo; iti namah.&lt;/strong> It means &amp;ldquo;Oh bhagavan, in my ignorance I have assumed I&amp;rsquo;m an individual separate from you. You&amp;rsquo;re all pervasive, you&amp;rsquo;re all. I assumed there are some things that belong to me. And this is wrong&amp;rdquo;. At least at the time of puja I relinquish what all I thought as belonging to me. &lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t have to say all of this belongs to Ishvara. That&amp;rsquo;s clear. You have to say none of this belongs to me.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tyAga - relinquishing, sacrifice, resignation, renunciation, divorce.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Abhimana - certain things you take as &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;-sense. And certain things you take as &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;-sense and &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo;-sense put together is called abhimana. Another name for abhimana is ajnana.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It looks like some things belong to me. But nothing of this world belongs to me and I don&amp;rsquo;t belong to this world.&lt;/strong> I belong into Ishvara. Now and here. We should grow into this. Ishvara and jiva are eternal friends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re very aware of the world, of the relationships, but all that is wrong. We&amp;rsquo;ve to grow out of the local consciousness. It covers up the reality. God alone is here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re so busy with the world we forget Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>God consciousness is called ishvariya vyavahara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We help a child to grow into local consciousness. All we know is hearsay, not knowledge. What is the basis of our &amp;ldquo;knowledge&amp;rdquo;? Mother hearsay.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After marriage and living with a young lady for few years, he&amp;rsquo;s reached a point. One has to grow into god-consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="class-1httpswwwyoutubecomwatchveb3fizdl_ks">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb3Fizdl_ks">Class 1&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Yoga: communion with God means god consciousness. Because it is like communion with space. It means you feel the presence of Ishwara at all times, everywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kamukha = lover, horny&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All manifestation is in the form of opposites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot have a world without contradiction. You cannot have any manifestation without the dharma adharma opposites.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a person is pursuing sukha trying to avoid dukha, he is not trying to transcend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation should always be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Incarnation of bhagavan as Kapila. He&amp;rsquo;s father of Sankhya darshanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only RG Veda is more ancient than Ramayana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Story of Kardama: he creates an aeroplane and travels all over the world with his wife Devahuti. He married on the condition that later in life he&amp;rsquo;ll take sanyasa. He did and Devahuti and Kapila were left alone at home.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rich people, army generals are not heroes in India. Spiritual people are stars. Dhruva is the greatest devote of Vishnu. He&amp;rsquo;s the pole star.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pravrtti karma. Lord takes avatara and destroys the adharmic oppressor. In nivrtti dharma there is nothing like destroying the enemy: the wisdom of the self disappears from the society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Staying with the knowledge of self is difficult.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In any given point of time in history of mankind there is few people who take up to the pursuit of self-knowledge. Generally people go after sense-pleasures. It becomes the norm and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur to us that life can be lived happily without.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sense pleasures come always with a price tag. &lt;strong>Life of sense pleasures is a costly life - high maintenance life.&lt;/strong> By pursuing sense pleasures we have to make a lot of money. Only 10% of our income is spent on the necessities. More than 90% goes to the pursuit of sense-pleasures. That&amp;rsquo;s the life of artha kama dharma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once a person is saturated with the changeful he goes after moksha. Freedom of the life of becoming, of binding of karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Vedanta first causality is heaven. We&amp;rsquo;re not interested.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can either transcend both pleasure and pain or have both. Can&amp;rsquo;t have only one. If you want life of becoming you&amp;rsquo;ll have both. Understanding this is called viveka. Once this is understood, seeking pleasure and avoiding pain will a non-issue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Number of people wanting to know the truth of the self is always small. Like PhD students.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even nirvtti-dharma also called atma-dharma needs to be safeguarded from time to time. The message needs to be given a boost. This is how the incarnation of Kapila has to be understood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A jnani is not a doer. He&amp;rsquo;s the being only. He is and he has a &amp;ldquo;IS&amp;rdquo; fragrance of self-inquiry. That gives a boost to the philosophy. What would have happened to the wisdom of upanishads without Kapila, Shankara, Ramana Maharsi? They came as avatara to protect and boost (atma) dharma. It has to be protected as much as pravrtti dharma. Rama protected pravrtti dharma. Shri Krishna protected both.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Greatest treatise of human philosophy is Gita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kapila was the first evolutionist. Darwin should be called Kapila of the West.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kardama suggested Devahuti can be a sanyasi and stay at home and learn from Kapila, as he&amp;rsquo;s incarnation of the Lord. Devahuti asked Kapila to teach, without that there is no teaching. This is how the dialog started.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The student should be seeking it. The formality is not a point, but the spirit of seeking must be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the dialogue is between a teacher and a student it is called samvada. If it is between two equals it is a vada. If it is a fight it is called vivada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge of the world is relative knowledge. Relative of what? Senses and the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Absolute knowledge is that knowledge which cannot be gained by the help of the mind. Perception and conceptualization as means of knowledge are out.&lt;/strong> That is the knowledge of the self. Atma vidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without I&amp;rsquo;m the &amp;ldquo;world is&amp;rdquo; situation is not there. &amp;ldquo;World is&amp;rdquo; is relative to &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo;, where as I&amp;rsquo;m is absolute.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The knowledge of the self is always presented in the form of a dialogue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devahuti&amp;rsquo;s question: what kind of bhakti most appropriate for gaining self-knowledge?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nirvana - cessation&amp;rsquo;s of all sorrow. Sorrow - fundamental sense of insecurity and wanting in a person. You cannot fill the void by accumulation. The more you accumulate, the more you want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Freedom is our birthright. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t need it? The moment we take birth as human being, we have right to nirvana. But you should seek, that is expected from you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Really speaking bhakti means God consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our endowment from the father Ishvara: mind, organs of cognition and action.&lt;/strong> A handicapped persons is handicapped all-right, but his insufficiency can be compensated elsewhere. Mind is there, the &lt;strong>main thing is the mind&lt;/strong>. The endowment has to be used to reach the goal. &lt;strong>Bhakti: effort of utilising this endowment in acquiring God-consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxplorgejkjy">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPLoRGejkJY">Class 2&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bhakti: emotional power (love) directed towards an altar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diving (direct?) expression of ananda, fullness, is love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should learn to give a new direction to the power of love. Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bhakti as psychological development in a persons life: you learn to ignore what is visible and try to relate to the invisible.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We invest all our emotions in the world only. It is one way traffic. &lt;strong>We love the world but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t love us back.&lt;/strong> As we love it more and more it gives us more and more misery in fact.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Motiveless love is neither impractical nor illogical. Just like a mother and a child.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For bhakti the altar must be sattvic. &lt;strong>Sattva: you worship god in the form of knowledge.&lt;/strong> God is the repository. Raja: god is the source of wealth and pleasures. Tamasic altar: motive is himsa etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ultimately it is the mind that holds the key to devotion. It is the mind that walks. All movement origins in the mind. &lt;strong>It is the mind that directs the flow of the sense organs.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accepted, welcomed (with love) suffering is not a suffering.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can either offer flowers or the oblations into fire, or worship the Lord in the heart of every (human) being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Employ our faculties in the service of the humanity all the time being conscious of the godhead. That god consciousness is a must.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who start near go far. Those who start far don&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere. First discover God in your heart. Normally we feel grievances and other negativity. Eventually we come to feel the endless all-pervading compassion of Ishvara in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any kind of gossip: the main element is mental violence.&lt;/strong> Reason: we are emotionally brute people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is &lt;strong>law: whatever you do to the other person you&amp;rsquo;re doing to your self. There are no exceptions. It goes for gossip as well.&lt;/strong> Medicine: listen to the glory of Ishvara, e.g. vedanta, and enjoy. Fake it till you make it and eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll discover that love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chocolate, coke, pizza etc. none of it is offered to god. &lt;strong>You should only eat what is offered to god.&lt;/strong> Chocolate is addictive, makes the mind more rajasic, agitated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Similarly, utilize the speech in singing the glory of Lord.&lt;/strong> Once the job is done, be quit, don&amp;rsquo;t use it any more. Use it in the service of others and then don&amp;rsquo;t use it any more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our life should be like a river. If it encounters an obstacle, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go back. It overcomes it, sometimes it just floods it, and moves forward. It never stops and goes until it reaches the ocean. Then &lt;strong>it loses its individuality. That is the highest sacrifice.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is generosity of the heart and of the hand. Later is easy. &lt;strong>The real generosity is recognition that I own nothing. Even this body I don&amp;rsquo;t own. I&amp;rsquo;ve borrowed it from the nature all around.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every motive defines and strengthens the ego.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rise above the crippling sense of isolation. That is the real bhakti. This leads to moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kosha - cocoon. Prison house.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>koshakara - silk worm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>koshakara does only two jobs. Eat and spin the silken thread in which they bind themselves and die. We spin the bonds of attachment (me and mine) and die in that kosha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fear comes out of attachment. We are selfish because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to suffer. We want to carry the past pleasure into future. Because of this fear of future pain we accumulate.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Real devotion: I surrender my welfare, future, to Ishvara.&lt;/strong> This ability to surrender is very rare.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One who doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother his yoga kshema (acquisition and keeping), who have surrendered, will never come to grief.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We believe that we believe in god. We believe in money, in our attachments, in worldly things. &lt;strong>If we really believe in God than from this moment onwards we don&amp;rsquo;t have an iota of concern about future. Having surrendered, you will never ever come to grief.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Western countries have best medical facilities yet worst fears of death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Live of &lt;strong>glorious uncertainty - surrender to Ishvara. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where my next square meal will come from, but I&amp;rsquo;m very comfortable. A millionaire is not so comfortable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody knows what will happen in the future, really.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we least expect it, we&amp;rsquo;ve got grace of Ishvara in copious quantity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Crystallised ignorance - self-identity with the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For a true devotee Ishvara is the beloved, self, devoted son, friend, guru, suhrt, altar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should not look for priya, we should look for hita (that which is good for us in the long run).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>mitra - friend (mutual help). suhrt - he doesn&amp;rsquo;t expect any help returned. There is only one suhrt in the universe - Ishvara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repetitive thing - dulls the mind, it goes to the hibernation. &lt;strong>Quality is important, not quantity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Physically we depend on everything. Psychologically we don&amp;rsquo;t depend on anything and anybody. All psychological dependence is directed to Ishvara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Looking at the rising sun is never a repeating experience. If looked at in the freshness of present movement. Without memory of it; that is dead. There is joy, communion. That&amp;rsquo;s how you look at the alter, that&amp;rsquo;s how you have to repeat the prayer. Even when saying the simple name &amp;ldquo;Rama&amp;rdquo;. There will be so much love. &lt;strong>Main obstacle is repetitive, dull mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fear is always about the future. People are sorrowful about the past - shoka. Only solution - surrender to Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Look at the sun. It always rises in the east and goes down in the west. Look at the clouds, wind, heat &amp;hellip; There is absolute reliance on Ishvara&lt;/strong>, on the supra-personal power.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvf_ikry1_g7m">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ikrY1_G7M">Class 3&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In a person&amp;rsquo;s life there is personal order. There seems to a be a (limited) choice, freewill there. An there is the supra-personal order. You cannot postpone the sunrise. It functions relentlessly whether you like it or not. A person is in trouble if he allows for a conflict to rise between these two orders. Every desire is a conflict between these two.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Desire: you&amp;rsquo;re not satisfied with what IS.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re not satisfied with the supra-personal order. Desire is a gulf between what is and what should be. What should be is the agenda of the mind. Never resists mentally to what is. That leads to emotional distress.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In jnani&amp;rsquo;s life the boundary between the two recedes and recedes until the two become one. Personal will is resolved in the supra-personal order. That&amp;rsquo;s how a jnani functions. &lt;strong>Whatever comes before a jnani, he accepts. And whatever he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even think of that.&lt;/strong> One has to examine one&amp;rsquo;s life carefully and learn to surrender to the higher power. That&amp;rsquo;s what is called bhakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our lives are commanded by a mysterious higher-power. &lt;strong>When we give a name, we believe we know. But naming is not knowing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless there is an identification with the body, the relationship cannot have any meaning. Love is not dependant upon a relationship. It is like rose.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I only know how to love. Whosoever comes in-front of me, I just love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no problem in the bigger picture. It is totally free from the problems of living.&lt;/strong> When abiding in the smaller picture (me, mine syndrome), you can never get a lasting solution for the problems of the smaller picture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The mind manufactures life for us. That is the smaller picture. You&amp;rsquo;d be able to consistently rise above this mind-made world.&lt;/strong> This ability is the bhakti. In one stroke, you&amp;rsquo;ll have solved all its problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negation of ego - sharanagatih, true bhakti. Rising above the smaller picture and learning to visualize, understand the bigger picture. In doing so life comes to a settlement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People generally don&amp;rsquo;t have settlement in life. They have issue with God, society, community, themselves &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Settlement: psychologically settled. A person at peace, in harmony.&lt;/strong> Reason is the smaller picture becomes overwhelming for us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When true bhakti is followed evtl. settlement comes when I realise that my true nature is brahman, divinity itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-knowledge is not knowledge of the self. It is the knowledge of what all you&amp;rsquo;re not. Ego is an entirely mind-manufactures, mythical, non-real entity. It is an image manufactured by the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the meditation you rise above the confines of the person and abide in the impersonal awareness. That is what is called sakshi bhava. You get an insight that you&amp;rsquo;re prior to the mind, ego, body identification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bhakti: make the rascal called ego a servant of god.&lt;/strong> As the bhakti increases the devotion decreases. This is the river merging into the ocean. This is the goal of human life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Young people, dominated by rajoguna, before emotional maturity - give a set of rules and a target. He&amp;rsquo;ll do that. Not able to be absorbed until sattvaguna is developed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Discovering love to the higher power, with or without a form, can happen only when you have dispassion towards the things of the world&lt;/strong>. Like pumping water upwards - there must not be any holes. Similarly mental energy called love will not go higher unless you withdraw it from the things of the world. This is called vayragyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raga-bhakti: You&amp;rsquo;ve love for ishvara. You see flower, you remember Ishvara. You see sky, remember Ishvara &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Beauty of moon, sun &amp;hellip; are portals to the glory of Ishvara.&lt;/strong> Once a person is established in raga bhakti, motiveless devotion to ishavara, he&amp;rsquo;s not restricted by rules and regulations any more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sun is rising. Small picture: time for breakfast and office.&lt;/strong> Breakfast and office will be there. We go about doing the things we have to do. But the smaller picture will not overwhelm me. &lt;strong>Sun is rising. Big picture: I look at the cosmic person itself. Soham. Ishvaras glory is reflecting in the solar or and at the same time reflecting here in the heart.&lt;/strong> Smaller picture has its relevance but we should never loose sight of the big.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is fear and insecurity in the small picture&lt;/strong>, within the smaller picture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lotusfeet: padapadma, padamula. Literal translation doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. The meaning is self-surrender.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>World has its own altars. Money, pleasure&amp;hellip; At which we surrender day after day. There is only one place to surrender, the lotus feet of Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ultimate well-being. Realization of the true self. Yogi is a sadhaka. A striver. One who pursues the path. Jijnasu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before going to the temple I should look at my self. What is my status? What am I? Esp. when dealing with a bhakti sastra as Bhagavatam. I&amp;rsquo;m a devotee. Baktoham and only then enter. Until one does this, the temple visit is not going to bring any real transformation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you come to the vedanta class. Ask the same. What are you? I should look at myself and then give autosuggestion &amp;ldquo;aham vijnasu&amp;rdquo;. This vicara is not meant for a samsari!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga is a very special means. Means of communion. Discovery of inner divinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakti should always be associated with viveka jnana and vayragya. If you have atma jnana you don&amp;rsquo;t need yoga anymore. It is the ultimate. In gita, jnana is viveka jnana - knowledge of discrimination.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowing that the world is a trap, not real, an appearance. That knowing is viveka. Resulting dispassion if vayragyam. These two are the prerequisites for bhakti yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Viveka: we take a lot of sorrow and fear from the world as we interact more and more with it. Vayragyam: interaction with the world will be to the exactly required extend only. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/strong> Now bhakti is in place and takes you go the goal. In this life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Constant refrain of Shri Krishna towards an individual: try to be nirmamo, nirahamkara. That is self-surrender.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should have bhakti that is not shattered by circumstances.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discrimination is the ultimate means of self-realization. Sastra is not going to present self on a platter. The labor of the sastra is discrimination between atma and anatma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is only knowing of the non-self as non-self. There is no knowing of the self.&lt;/strong> Then if there is no identification with the non-self, then remains and shines only the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ishvara is called Shesha (residue, remainder) because he remains in the process of all negation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First vivekaprakriya. Then sarvatmaprakriya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Laws of Vedanta: 1) whatever begins in time ends in time. 2) whatever begins and ends in time is unreal, whatever might be the length of the timescale.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Appearance only proves non-reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reality has nothing to do with sentimentality. Reality does not respect sentimentality. What appears without really being there is mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the entire sastra, wherever you see the world jnanayoga, it is viveka jnana yoga.&lt;/strong> If you neglect viveka, you&amp;rsquo;ll miss sarvatma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both prakuruti (five elements -&amp;gt; body, mind) and purusha (atma) are found in the same medium. That&amp;rsquo;s why discrimination is needed. Where is the mix-up? In the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pascal: As the physical body I&amp;rsquo;m a speck engulfed by the vast space of the universe. But as the mind, I have the power to understand the entire universe. Vedantin: as a mind, I know the universe. Not only that, as atma, I&amp;rsquo;m the universe. I&amp;rsquo;m the conscious being. The subtlest entity in the universe. That is sarvatmabhava. That is moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The entire physiology belongs to the nature. Not to the purusha - it is the conscious being. Body is called a city of 9 (gita) /11 (kathopanishad) gates. Sun of atma is reflecting (purushete) through the mind in the body. Purnatvat purusha - atma is purna.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvd_krkpat0m8">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_KrKpat0m8">Class 4&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>prakuruti purusha viveka - most important topic of vedanta. Purusha in vedanta means life and intelligence (not intellect) put together.&lt;/strong> Name for it is atman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is one hallmark of Shankara bashyas? Discrimination he emphasizes. He ended up writing a book on it - vivekacudamani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re deriving a sense of self from the physical body. I&amp;rsquo;m male. I&amp;rsquo;m born in Andrapradesh &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People are so much concerned about health, well-fare of the body that the concern itself becomes a problem.&lt;/strong> Develop intelligent indifference towards the body. It will remain in its place, healthy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am not the body. I&amp;rsquo;m aware of the body in action. I use it as a tool. And I&amp;rsquo;m always conscious of the body as the other. I maintain it well, neither pamper it nor neglect it. Manage it with intelligent indifference. Withdraw obsessive care from the body and see what happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is the meeting point of life and intelligence with the matter which is the physical body.&lt;/strong> Of spirit and matter. Spirit being cosmic life and intelligence. Matter being conglomerate of the five elements - physical body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind, because of its crudity and ignorance identifies with the physical body instead of identifying with its source which is the spirit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body has a form. Aliveness is formless. &lt;strong>As I identify with the body there is a sense of separation. The world is the other.&lt;/strong> When you abide in that aliveness you don&amp;rsquo;t experience any otherness. When you look at the body you&amp;rsquo;re in the grip of the time. Body has time imprinted in itself. Like wrinkles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is nothing like death. &lt;strong>Body is formed by integration (negative entropy) and disintegrates (positive entropy). In jnanis vision death is not an event worth looking at. He&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to face death. You need not protect the body, you need not feed it. All this trouble will be ending once and for all.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True self is not tainted by the qualities of the prakuruti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is a tool, an instrument of cognition. You&amp;rsquo;re not the mind. Watch the mind. Instead of we use the mind &lt;strong>the mind uses us. We live a life dictated by the mind, because of the identification with the mind. Mind is prakrti, it is the product of the food we eat.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you want to do meditation, you&amp;rsquo;d have command of your food habits. Suppose you have a heavy breakfast and try to do mediation. As the food is put in the stomach you become tamasic. Further sleep. Lifestyle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do you know that there is a bright line in a spectrum? Because there is a dark line above and below. You will not know a bright line if there are no dark ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it comes down to Vedanta, you&amp;rsquo;d have a big grip on language and pronunciation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without the immobile the mobile cannot exist. The motion is always relative to something.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body is always in motion. Not even an entity. It is an flux. There is a &lt;strong>law of Buddha: law of impermanence of forms. It looks like a form but it is a flow, a changing thing.&lt;/strong> The underlying reality that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change is the pure &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The being doesn&amp;rsquo;t require another means for knowing. It is knowing itself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t try to derive pleasure from the mind. I don&amp;rsquo;t need mind to be happy. Then you&amp;rsquo;ll discover the real happiness.&lt;/strong> Otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll be running after pleasures. You become happy and you will become unhappy also. Mind cannot sustain pleasure for long. It is an excited state. It will have to come down. &lt;strong>Excited state is the most uncomfortable state.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qualities of the mind seem to taint me but the fact is I&amp;rsquo;m not the mind. I&amp;rsquo;m the immobile, upholding the mobile. Whole life is spent identifying with the mobile. As long as you do, you remain ignorant of the immobile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I hit the table. Both the body and the table change. If there is no change, there is no action.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m is the window to the truth. Hold on to it and it will tell you the true self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot expect the guru to inquire on your behalf. What we want is to give a check to the guru so he will reserve a small piece of heaven for us. Guru can only show the way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are not the physical body. Guru is not the physical body. You take yourself to be the body so you take the guru to be a body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m - the awareful presence. It is the verification, the truth, of everything. Of all. Is there any doing in it? Doing is in the mind, sense organs, body, world. Doing is motion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discovery: The being, shining as the knowing, without any doing in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cheerful - sattvaguna. Sorrowful - rajoguna. Dull - tamoguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be at peace. Forgetfulness doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to you. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; will be forever with you. Gunas don&amp;rsquo;t belong to atma, the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re hypnotised to believe we&amp;rsquo;re the doers. A fan is rotating. Is electricity is rotating? Without electricity can there be any rotation? Atma is not the actor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There can be action without the actor. Rose blossoms, the fragrance is spread all around. Where is the actor? Like the rose the universe has blossom. When I speak it is something like that. Body - given. Intellect - given. Language - given. Sastra - given. Speech - given. Memory - given. Nothing authored by me.&lt;/strong> Do you plan and forget or forgetfulness happens? Memory, does it happen or you remember?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If at the end of lesson I feel I&amp;rsquo;m the doer, it will be a huge burden. Let there be action. If you don&amp;rsquo;t identify with the action then you&amp;rsquo;re not a doer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If the action is planned, there is a result. The moment a result is there, there is a will which is the doer.&lt;/strong> Another case. There is action. But there is no result, no will, no doer. But there is purpose. It is very fruitful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Result: outcome directed towards the self.&lt;/strong> Result - phalam. Purpose - prayojanam. Result establishes you as a bhokta and bhoktrtvam establishes you as a karta. Don&amp;rsquo;t even think of the result.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Will is that which attracts the result to itself.&lt;/strong> When there is no will there is just action. That action liberates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m the doer. The truth (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo;) got mixed up with the untruth (&amp;ldquo;doer&amp;rdquo;). Where is the motion, in the mind or in the witness? All movement is prakuruti, none in purusha. Aham karomi is the delusion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you are the hearer you should be able to hear when you want and not hear when you don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/strong> But hearing happens regardless of your will. There is no freedom for you. Same for seeing &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t feel it the blank &amp;ldquo;by whom&amp;rdquo;. You need not have a doer every time. &lt;strong>Action can be there without a doer.&lt;/strong> There is love in such action. And then understand that you&amp;rsquo;re not the doer in any given situation. But there can be doership if you wrongly identify with prakuruti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you have to do, you need not be told. Right action follows right knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m the being shining as the knowing in which there is no doing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wherever you find people organising themselves understand that they are insecure.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify with jnana indriyas, you&amp;rsquo;re a bhotka. Identify with the karma indriyas, you&amp;rsquo;re a karta.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not the walker. You&amp;rsquo;re the knower behind the walker. Just go for walk alone and be alertful. The same walking develops a new dimension.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsara: being caught in the cycle of pleasure of pain. As long as one identifies with the body, he&amp;rsquo;ll be caught in the cycle of opposites (pain/pleasure, dharma/adharma, birth/death).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First reason: no vayragyam. One is a go-getter, wants to grab and enjoy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enjoyment of sense-pleasures always comes with a price. There is always hangover. Sense pleasures don&amp;rsquo;t come easy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every act of sense pleasure enjoyment reinforces the idea that you&amp;rsquo;re a bhokta/karta.&lt;/strong> Every selfish act accumulates. Present lot is the direct result of accumulation of actions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suffering I&amp;rsquo;m going through now is the direct result of karma (karma dosha).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every human being is a mishra. +/- 50:50 of sukha dukha. What good try to look into future for how much sukha is there and trying to manipulate? Therefore human being, know your essential nature - brahman - and be liberated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What you saw is unreal. That you saw is a fact.&lt;/strong> Suppose the dream is nightmarish, it makes you suffer. Suppose it is pleasant, but makes you happy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>They day you&amp;rsquo;re ego-less, the purpose of this bhakti, where there is an element of plurality, is over. Until then, you have to pursue.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Let the other people be whatever they are. Never try to command, dictate. It is for them to choose the path. Give total freedom. If they&amp;rsquo;re not choosing the right path, give advice. If they don&amp;rsquo;t follow, no problem.&lt;/strong> They will pay a price and learn and come back. We should not allow such freedom to our mind. It should be brought under control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I use the mind, when I need to think. &lt;strong>When the need for thinking is over, I should be able not to think.&lt;/strong> Listless thinking - just following non-sensical flow of thought. Compulsive thinking - &lt;strong>the origin of sorrow and fear is thought. If you stop thinking, there will be no sorrow&lt;/strong>. But that is not the solution really, when you live you have to think.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The tormentor is not the boss at the office. The tormentor is sitting in your mind.&lt;/strong> It is you who allowed him to become a tormentor. Compulsive, listless thinking are the enemies. Because mind is threading wrong path, it is attached to the sense pleasures, to the things of the world. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is accumulating sorrow and fear. Turn it back. Change its character. Purify the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purity of mind is priority for any individual who wants to live peaceful life. What we really need in life is not pleasures, but peace and harmony. Develop dispassion towards the world and love towards Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you go to a friend and tell &amp;ldquo;I love you because you did not press to return the loan you gave me&amp;rdquo;. How will he feel? Suppose he says &amp;ldquo;I love you for what you are&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>Conditioned love is not love.&lt;/strong> Suppose you go to god and tell &amp;ldquo;I love you because you&amp;rsquo;re the husband of goddess of wealth&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; If you love me for the sake of some other thing, you&amp;rsquo;re not a student of Gita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devotion purifies the mind and neutralizes the ego like nothing else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhaktrhari: vayragyam eva abhayam. &lt;strong>Real wealth is not bhagyam, but vayragyam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A cow can eat a nice fruit with a gusto as well. A human being comes to glory only through vayragyam. Enjoyments of sense pleasures animals also have.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vayragyam won&amp;rsquo;t come by itself. You have to cultivate it. Nature of mind is that it wants to accumulate.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Just accumulate enough so the body can be used. Not more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accumulation begins with wealth. Having accumulated enough, we accumulate objects of the world. Then relationships - networking - connections.&lt;/strong> For what? It makes us samsaris. We won&amp;rsquo;t be left with any energy to contemplate upon ishvara. We have to &lt;strong>seek solitude. Meditation is the appointment with the inner self.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Live simple and noble life. God consciousness must be reflected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shanti - cessation of mental noise. That&amp;rsquo;s what we have to seek. It opens up reasonless spring of joy. Ramathirtha: &lt;strong>You need a reason to be joyous? It is slavery!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless body and mind are healthy, you cannot transcend them. What you gain with the mind is not the truth in any case. We bother about mind so it won&amp;rsquo;t come in the way. Like dealing with a thief. To make body and mind pure you need yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The backbone is line an antenna. It should not be crooked.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmacarya in the context of grhastah means to be loving to your partner.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t accumulate. Give away. Don&amp;rsquo;t throw away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put flowers into hair, dress nicely &amp;hellip; but don&amp;rsquo;t go for fashion. Dress and body must be clean.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forgiving: in-spite the other person committing a mistake, I don&amp;rsquo;t hold it against him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obsession with progress is unnecessary. Contentment with what I have is important.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tapas - &lt;strong>you voluntarily take up some difficulty for the body. You should never give up tapas.&lt;/strong> Sadhus: you don&amp;rsquo;t get breakfast? Take it as tapas. Shift the focus of attention. Do the same with body pains.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Surrender: I accept what is. What is not, I do not desire.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re in harmony. Peace. &lt;strong>Be happy for grace of Ishvara has no bounds. Whatever happens is compassion of Ishvara.&lt;/strong> He&amp;rsquo;s like a rain bearing cloud. Isvhara gives only blessing, it is us who make misery out of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-6httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvt7ul1tbmgmg">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Ul1TbMgmg">Class 6&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sitting posture is very important. Upper portion of the body should be erect. Legs should be close to the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To begin with, you need some effort. Eventually the asana should become effortless. And the mind should resolve. What remains is ananta. When the mind is functioning what you&amp;rsquo;re with is the limited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Initially we need a posture. Evtl. the posture becomes irrelevant. You&amp;rsquo;re calm and quiet. You&amp;rsquo;re watchful and alert and abiding in the svarupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prana means cosmic life. Prana is not the life in this body.&lt;/strong> Living beings are many, life is universal. Just like light. It is universal yet it reflects in a particular body. &lt;strong>Life is there in every particle. Whole universe is intelligent universe, including the matter. It is not dead matter&lt;/strong>. Life in the context of the individual body is expressing as respiration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are two kinds of pranayama. Willful and without.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prana is the limb between matter and spirit.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pratyahara - being indifferent to sound. It is not the sound that is disturbing. &lt;strong>Stop resisting any sound, become indifferent. Not resisting nor welcoming any sensuous stimuli.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pratyahara is important as the mind runs away through these five windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As sophistication increases it becomes very difficult to satisfy sense organs and we become slaves to them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughtless, not mindless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pratyahara you don&amp;rsquo;t practice separately. It is always with dhyana (very focused meditation) or dharana (broad focus).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;d not enforce anything. If you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like doing it, don&amp;rsquo;t. We should not pursue puja/meditation because we fear God. We&amp;rsquo;d love it. Fearlessness is the first quality a student of vedanta should learn.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Breathing is the link between finite and infinite.&lt;/strong> Stay with it and you&amp;rsquo;ll get an insight about the infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infinite is an negative word.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study of vedanta without devotion - sushka vedanta. Parambrahma is not sat cit alone, it is ananda also. It is rasa. Even in sadhana you&amp;rsquo;ve to bring the love for Ishvara. Fake it till you make it. Listen to the glory and exploits of Isvhara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Healthy people are generally happy. And vice versa. Because all illness originates in the mind. &lt;strong>If the mind is pure and loving, your immune system will be very good.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the mind there is a habit of categorising people, life-forms etc. Rise above all of that, all life is sacred. Be equanimous towards all life-forms. &lt;strong>Sarva bhuta samatvam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love can conquer the worst hell also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is simple, &lt;strong>if you are attached to the things of world, you don&amp;rsquo;t love God.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t fall into the trap &amp;ldquo;world is nothing but God so loving them is as good as loving God&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love is not the same as attachment. Suppose I&amp;rsquo;m attached to the son. It is harmful for the son and for me also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>prasanga - attachment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>svadharma - I do my duty with love, commitment and devotion. I have duties, not responsibilities.&lt;/strong> Krishna in Gita doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak of responsibilities. &lt;strong>Duty is what you do in the present. Responsibility is what you seek as result in the future.&lt;/strong> The more we understand this, the more we can be at peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Duty + your greed for the result = responsibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People don&amp;rsquo;t love God. They love their concept of god. And they don&amp;rsquo;t love so much the others&amp;rsquo; concept of the god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice maunam. You&amp;rsquo;d speak in measured tones. You&amp;rsquo;d speak when you have to. Don&amp;rsquo;t speak untruth. &amp;ldquo;Speak the truth&amp;rdquo; would give license to speak 24h a day. Do it for a weak and your mind becomes so calm you cannot believe it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Excessive consumption is unspiritual. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste water, money, food, &amp;hellip; Always take a little less than you need and then finish it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without meditation you have no chance to come into contact with reality. To make it work, you have to prepare well. One of the preparations is &lt;strong>don&amp;rsquo;t accumulate, don&amp;rsquo;t consume much and be happy with what you have. Never complain.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is a movement. It has to flow either towards samsara or towards Ishvara.&lt;/strong> There is no 3rd flow. As it contemplates upon Ishvara there is a reasonless joy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind becomes what it things upon. &lt;strong>When mind contemplates upon Shiva that is enough to bring out inherent joy as wave after wave.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakti is an emotion. It is not knowledge, it is emotion. It prepares the mind for higher knowledge by purifying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shivas feet - lotus like - aravinda. Aravinda is the lotus which blossoms as the sun rises in the east. Sun stands for knowledge, for atma. Aravidma stands for the mind which is ready to receive that knowledge. Isvaras feet are always compared with the lotus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you take literally that becomes religion. If you take spirit, it becomes philosophy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spirit of holding on to the feet of Shiva is total self-surrender (sharanagati).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always contemplate: consistently, perseveringly. Not every second of the waking state. &lt;strong>Instead of contemplating things of the world we may better contemplate on Lord Shiva.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A heavy laden mind cannot go towards Isvara. The mind should be simple, subtle, light. Story in Purana: when a person dies there is a devaduta standing there with a balance. The suksha sharira (mind) is put into one pan and in the other weights are put. If it is light it goes to heaven, if heavier it goes to hell. Therefore our emotions should be simple.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The river, no matter where it has taken birth, it has only one goal - ocean. The mind should overcome the absorbing power of samsara and ultimately reach the ocean.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is Isvara who makes the first step, then it must be our effort. Like a creeper. It chooses a tree and then starts growing in that direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inching towards Isvara is equivalent to inching away from samsara.&lt;/strong> Ramakrishna: Love towards Isvara grows in direct proportion to dispassion to the things of the world. You go towards east and west simultaneously. Dispassion towards things of the world and motiveless devotion to Isvara progress simultaneously. The more we get entangled in samsara, the more devotion gets less and less.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no chaos in the world except the chaos you have in your mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The devotion should not be seasonal (when things go well).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Devotion is entirely our effort. Isvara made his will very clear - come near me and I will protect you. Now it is for us to go near.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The river just relinquishes names and form. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t give up its true individuality of being (water). It becomes one with the infinite. Bhakti becomes one with the infinite but it must be in such a way that egoity must be neutralized.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Egoic state - where there is an effort to preserve the identity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love for the world is called attachment. The same love directed towards Ishvara is called boundless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Love is such a thing, unless we put bounds in ignorance, it has no bounds.&lt;/strong> Just like space. Mahatmas don&amp;rsquo;t restrict the love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsari&amp;rsquo;s love is a vector. Jnanis love is a scalar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is notion that beauty has to come from outside things by reorganizing things. Same for happiness.&lt;/strong> Societies across the globe are moved by this notion. Because I&amp;rsquo;m disenchanted in the heart and I want some respite from it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doing is not intrinsic to atma. &lt;strong>Atma is being and knowing. Doing is there and there is purpose for it - antahkarana shuddhi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind is limited in the sense that whatever it can think of is always limited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the essence of a tree? Fruit. What is the essence of cow? Milk. &lt;strong>What is the essence of a human being? Ishvara bhakti and jnanam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Except bhakti there is nothing else in the heart. Then you have the crop, which is self-knowledge. That life only is fruitful. Any other life is wasted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the creation ends the devatas resolve also in Parameshvara. They are also part of samsara only. Even a little peace of real happiness one won&amp;rsquo;t get from worship of devatas. Ananda devata cannot give.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devote: &amp;ldquo;Sri Krisha make my mind pure and make me happy&amp;rdquo; - he knows how to and can grant. If you ask for a new car, he&amp;rsquo;ll consult his prarabdha &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no real happiness in pursuit of all this. I don&amp;rsquo;t want all this. I&amp;rsquo;m done with that. I want only one thing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having created duality out of language now you have to negate it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shakti resolves in the being becomes Shiva. The becoming aspect of Shiva is Shakti. The resolution of Shakti to being is Shiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Isvara being ananda, how can there be dukha in the creation? Ananda is the upadana of the universe. Why there is dukha? That&amp;rsquo;s our creation.&lt;/strong> Isvara doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to create a dukha. Dukha is created by jiva. Not god, thus god will not be able to remove it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pleasure and pain always go together.&lt;/strong> Stomach pain I create. By overeating in the night. Why? Because I want &amp;hellip; pleasure. &lt;strong>As you pursue one you create the opposite.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything is wrong with accumulation. Cups and saucers behind a glass in a cupboard!? I&amp;rsquo;m looking for some meaning it it. Then we come to Vedanta. And we accumulate emotions. A child does not. As the emotions are accumulated we become heavy laden like a ship.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What we are accumulating is terminology. Vedanta is all about unlearning. Nothing new you learn. Nothing new you get. &lt;strong>Good Vedanta teaching is that demolishes every possible concept that a person has in the mind and leaves him free and open so he can be the truth which he already is.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People have become linguistic. They are no more existential. Biodata is my linguistic &amp;ldquo;being&amp;rdquo;, all mithya. What I&amp;rsquo;m truly cannot be put in the biodata, even one word.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re totally deluded thinking that literature and language is the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We accumulate formulas. Will they eliminate this horrible samsara? Are they helping us? Will they remove it? We must honestly examine it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How long will it take for you to come to the truth? Stop the accumulation. Collect all the formula in one place. Make it simple. Develop devotion. Purify your heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Collect and showcase formulas. It will not save. Ultimately there is only one way - sharanagatih. Oh, intelligent person, you&amp;rsquo;ve learned enough of new things. What you&amp;rsquo;ve learned start practising and develop that total inner devotion to Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A time comes when we&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated enough. Now it is time to take stock. Keep what is required and take proper steps.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>First step is freedom from the concern of the future. It is horrible egoic state. The only way is Ishvara sharanagati. Then be open minded, don&amp;rsquo;t have too many expectations. Dismantle the entire structure of expectations.&lt;/strong> Then let the future unfold itself. &lt;strong>Allow the life to unfold itself&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Did you take lunch? When are you leaving?&amp;rdquo; Simple and practical. What is there to discuss about the concern of future. Whenever there is concern about the future &lt;strong>enjoy the glorious anxiety.&lt;/strong> Allow it to unfold. Devote to Ishvara. &lt;strong>I pray only one thing: give me the strength to face the future.&lt;/strong> Ability to surrender to Ishvara. Only a strong mind can surrender.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All self-seeking is a violence. We take the same self-seeking to selfish pity-mindedness to the religion. That&amp;rsquo;s why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any transformative power. It seems to have become dumb. Public show is not religion. Private communion!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We should not try to impress god. We should surrender to god. Spirit of self-surrender alone bridges the gap between jiva and Ishvara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devotion is not an easy thing. We&amp;rsquo;re more devoted to the world than to Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind offering is meditation. No more karma. No object is offered. That is the greatest worship. This wisdom, entirely by your grace, has taken root in my heart. I&amp;rsquo;m fulfilled. I surrender day after day at your lotus feet. Whatever wealth, resources &amp;hellip; are needed, you take care of it. Devotee won&amp;rsquo;t suffer.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>deva - shining. The one light that is always shining: consciousness.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>By conditioning gold as neckless you have not made its value lesser.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Gold is the origin of necklace and gold abides in the necklace.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Existence has an opposite - non existence. Being has none. Being is the foundation of the entire universe. Being is atma, the essence of entire universe of forms.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Whatever is nama rupa is not tattvam.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who begins near goes far. Who begins far does not go anywhere.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Depois da tempestade vem a bonança&lt;br>
Depois da calamidade vem a esperança&lt;br>
Como a fénix, renascemos das cinzas com a arte de viver&lt;br>
Depois de um expresso que navegou o submundo&lt;br>
Depois da noite escura da alma e da grande tribulação&lt;br>
Acordamos para a primavera da vida&lt;br>
E através das trevas chegamos sem tempo nem hora marcada&lt;br>
À alvorada da alma&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ainda não partiste e eu já tenho saudades&lt;br>
Das longas tardes, com novas amizades&lt;br>
Na esplanada a beber limonada gelada&lt;br>
Piada lançada, é geral a gargalhada&lt;br>
Bem sei que nada dura para sempre&lt;br>
Como castelos de areia que caem de repente&lt;br>
No zénite os raios atingem-me a pique&lt;br>
A sombra não encontra a pele com salitre&lt;br>
Quando o mercúrio sobe, o suor escorre&lt;br>
A melancolia some, a aura explode&lt;br>
Intensidade, insanidade temporária&lt;br>
Paixão tórrida, alma purificada&lt;br>
O ócio da espreguiçadeira na palmeira&lt;br>
É o fim do estio, e esta noite é a derradeira&lt;br>
Não consigo esperar pelo próximo episódio&lt;br>
Vou atrás de ti até ao trópico de capricórnio&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brahmasutras (1-4)</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-04-17-brahmasutras/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-04-17-brahmasutras/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://vedantastudents.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/01-Bramha-Sutra-Volume-1.pdf">notes&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://www.sankaracharya.org/library/BrahmaSutra.pdf">summary&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="01--introduction">01 INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sutra - small statement with lot of ideas packed in it. Aphorism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Audio/oral tradition, not visual. Writing was not there and even when it came, it was not used very much.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A huge book can be compressed into few sutras which are memorized. Sutra method has been devised because of memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sutra method - putting all the ideas in metrical verse form. Poetry form. It is easier to remember a verse form. There is a rhythm and you can tune and sing it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmasutra: 555 sutras take about 10 pages when written down. When expanded you can write books and books. It&amp;rsquo;s like an atom bomb.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Task 1: Extracting the vedantic teaching through upanishadic interpretation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Task 2: Defending the teaching by answering charges of other philosophies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Task 3: Offense: &amp;ldquo;What right you have to talk about logical defects when your system is full of logical loopholes?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qualification 1: readiness for hair-splitting. Once the question of interpretation comes hair-splitting of words, sentences and ideas is involved. Thus this book might appear too dry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qualification 2: study of at least 10 upanishads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We do not require Brahmasutra (BS) for jnanam and moksha. Any competent teacher teaches BG and upanishads only based on BS. Therefore study of BG and upanishads is indirect study of BS and therefore enough for jnanam and moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BS is considered as one of the three basic texts of vedantic teaching. BG - smrti prasthanam, upanishads - shruti prasthanam, BS - nyaya prasthanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BS is not required for a student, but very important for a teacher.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="02--introduction">02 INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intellect, intelligence, power of reasoning is the extra faculty because of which human being is different from all other animals.&lt;/strong> If you take it from the human being, it is as good as an animal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ability to judge, form opinions, have goals, develop plans and work for the achievement thereof. Thus &lt;strong>every human being is a thinker&lt;/strong>, whatever be the level of thinking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every serious thinker will have to analyze six topics and form a clear conclusion.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>jivah - what is a living being?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jagat - what is this world?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>isvara&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bandhah - why human suffering? Why misery, bondage, samsara?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>moksah/mukti - freedom from bondage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sadhanam - means by which one goes from bondage to liberation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A consistent view/teaching regarding these topics is called darshanam. The one who founds such a philosophy is called darshanikah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are six nAstika darshanani and six astika darshanani. nastikas - veda pramanam nasti:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>carvaka - materialists. No dharma, no heaven, no hell, no punarjanma, no veda, no atma &amp;hellip; only sense pleasures as the ultimate goal. Modern science is very close to materialistic philosophy. Founder brhaspatih released this philosophy to destroy the asuras, as they will not accept the veda. brhaspatih prathama sishya was carvakah. He got this name because his speech is so convincing: enjoy life! Who has seen sukshma, karana sharirams? I&amp;rsquo;ve seen no such thing. caru - beautiful, vac - speech. It is so wild, uncivilized that it is not dealt with in BS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jaina darshanam. Supposed to be given by 24 acaryas, beginning with rshabadevah and ending with vartamana mahavirah (also known as jinah - one who has conquered himself, therefore jainism).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>four branches of buddhism. Buddha - enlightened, wise. He did not systematically teach a system of philosophy. He gave stray statements to people who approached him. Therefore initially Buddhism was not a well-developed system. Three early scriptures - tripitaka. Sanskrit -&amp;gt; Pali (&lt;code>r&lt;/code> got lost in the names): abidharma -&amp;gt; abhidamma. One original Buddhism gave later birth to four branches: sautrantika, vaybhasika, yogacara, madhyamika.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Six astika darshanams:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Sanhkya darshanam of kapila muni.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga darshanam of patanjali.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nyaya darshanam of gautama.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vaysheshika darshanam of kanAda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purvamimamsa darshanam by jaimini rishi. Based on veda purva bhaga - karmakandah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uttaramimamsa darshanam of vyasa. Importance is on veda uttara or anta bhagah. veda purva is not thrown away but supporting the vega antah.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are all astikas because they accept veda pramanam but not all of them accept isvara (1, 4, 5).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First four accept veda pramana but give more importance to tarka (reasoning). Therefore them and all nastikas are called tarkikah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All these astika darshanams are in sutra form. Uttaramimamsa sutrani is also known as brahma sutrani or vedanta sutrani or shariraka (=atma) sutrani or vyasa/badarayana sutrani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmasutras, being dense and short statements, have given birth to more than ten interpretations. Tree are very popular:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>nirvishesha advaitam as revealed by shankaracarya bhasyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vishistadvaitam through shribhasyam by ramanujacharya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dvaitam based on the commentary by madhvacarya called anubhasyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="03--santi-mantras">03 SANTI MANTRAS&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the teacher doesn&amp;rsquo;t do homework, he cannot communicate properly. If the student doesn&amp;rsquo;t do homework, he cannot listen/grasp fully. The more homework both of them do, the more is the amount of grasping (vIryam).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teacher needs compassion, sishya needs confidence into the teacher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gopayati - to hide, to guard, to protect&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mantra 4 by trishanku &lt;a href="https://www.kidsgen.com/fables_and_fairytales/indian_mythology_stories/trishankus_heaven.htm">1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishanku">2&lt;/a>: &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m as great as the Lord, I enliven, invigorate all the creation. I&amp;rsquo;m as glorious as the Lord. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the greatest wealth in the world which is brahmajnanam.&lt;/strong> &lt;em>om aham vRkSaya rerivA; kIrtih pRSTham gireviva; Urdhvapavitro vAjinIva svamRtamasmi; draviNagm savarcasam; sumedhA amRto&amp;rsquo;kSitah; iti triSaNkorvedAnuvacanam; om zAntih zAntih zAntih&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mantra 10 from svetaasvatara upanishad of krishna yajurveda: &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m surrendering to the Lord (sharanagatih). It is your job to rescue me from samsara. If I require a guru, you provide. If the guru is not competent, you make him competent. If I&amp;rsquo;m not, you make me competent. All responsibility is yours - beautiful surrender attitude. Jnana yoga is preceded by sharanagatih and it ends in sharanagatih only.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hiranyagarbha (Brahmaji) is also a disciple of Ishvara because he gets vedas from Ishvara alone. The only difference - he doesn&amp;rsquo;t require the systematic teaching. Doing tapas he gathers this wisdom in the form of intuition.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="04--dhyana-slokas">04 DHYANA SLOKAS&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Narayana (Bhagavan Vishnu) is the first acarya. He created Brahmaji who became the first disciple.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hiranyagarbha or Brahmaji is called Padmabhuvam since he appeared out of lotus according to puranas. Padmat sambhavati (spring up). &lt;strong>By sheer meditation he was able to grasp the teaching. Vedic wisdom arose for Brahmaji.&lt;/strong> Vishnu served not as visible guru but as ashariri guru.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Third acarya is Vashista who is disciple of Brahma. Each one happens to be both putra and sishya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vartikam is a critical commentary in verse form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Narayana parampara is aviccinna (continuous) because I&amp;rsquo;m able to learn it even now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alayam - temple, abode. sruti-smruti-purananam alayam kuranalayam (abode of compassion).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shankara {sham+kara} - making auspicious&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First shankara refers to lord Shiva. That Shiva alone has taken birth as Shankaracarya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vyasa - avatar of keshava (Vishnu). sUtrabASyakRtau - &lt;strong>Vishnu (as Vyasa) wrote BS and commentary was written by Shiva (as Shankara)&lt;/strong>. Another conclusions. &lt;strong>All the other darshanani were created by human intellect, only vedanta darshanam available in BS is not a product Vyasacarya&amp;rsquo;s intellect but it is the teaching extracted from upanishads. Thus Vyasa is not the founder of vedanta darshanam, only codification, systemization and giving supportive logic is Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s. Vedanta darshanam did exist even before Vyasa, starting with Narayana, unlike the other darshanani.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>shivasya hrdayam vishnu vischnosca hrdayam shivah.&lt;/strong> Vishnu and Shiva are one and the same. Narayana is Sadashiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord Shiva appears in three forms. Isvara (prameyam - subject matter). Guruh (pramanam - the teaching). Jivatma (sishya - pramata - the knower).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vyomavatvyaptadehaya. One who&amp;rsquo;s real nature is allpervading caytanyam like the akasha.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="05--outline-of-brahmasutras">05 OUTLINE OF BRAHMASUTRAS&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya: even if you give any credit to me, all credit belongs to the previous acaryas who have done the work. What a humility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the beginning, the two sounds &lt;strong>OM&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>atha&lt;/strong> (now) came from Brahmaji and therefore they are auspicious.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In BS there are four adhyaya - chapter. Each chapter is subdivided into four sections - four padas. Each section is divided into topics known as adhikaranam (total of 191). The number of adhikaranams is not uniform among sections. Mots of the topics are taken from the upanishads. Each adhikaranam is subdivided into a certain number of sutras (total 555).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Broadly four topics are discussed. Samanvaya - consistency. Vyasa presents consistency as the proof (hetu) that brahman is the central theme of the upanishads. Other darshanams, esp. sankhya and purvamimamsa do not accept this but say theme of Vedanta is karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd chapter deals with avirodha - non contradiction. Vyasa establishes that brahmavidya doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any contradictions. Three types of contradictions: internal within the Veda itself, no contradiction with smrti, no contradiction with logic. Heavily logic based.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3rd chapter deals with sadhana. Preparatory disciplines for gaining brahmavidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4th chapter, the smallest, is called phalaadhyaya. Deals with moksha. Krama mukti and satyomukti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedantic statements are like flowers but are not arranged, it is a wild growth. BS serves as a thread for stringing the upanishadic ideas who are like beads (191 beads/flowers). Thus presenting a beautiful vedantic sastra garland - a systematic philosophy (darshanam)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Condition for enquiry - doubt. No need to enquire into the obvious.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="06--two-types-of-inference">06 TWO TYPES OF INFERENCE&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If perception can&amp;rsquo;t be used directly, inference is used. &lt;strong>If the inference is to be valid, it has to be based on observed data. Suppose one doesn&amp;rsquo;t collect any data, that is imagination, speculation, wishful thinking.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Components of &lt;strong>inference (anumana)&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>paksha - locus of discussion. Matter of dispute. It has to be visible or known. There is visible and invisible part. We&amp;rsquo;re proving the invisible part. E.g. parvataha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sadhyam - conclusion. Always apratyaksam (not known). E.g. agniman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hetu - reason. E.g. dhumavat. Always pratyaksam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>drsthanta - example. E.g. yatra maha nase. I don&amp;rsquo;t say smoke invariably co-exists with fire. We only say the fire invariably is where smoke is there. Yatra yatra dumah tatra tatra agnih. Oposite we can&amp;rsquo;t say (e.g. body has fire - 38C yet no smoke).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whole logic is studied only to intellectually see the finer distinctions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>E.g. &lt;strong>vyapti jnanam = knowledge of invariable co-existence&lt;/strong> (e.g. of fire along with smoke). vyapti (invariable co-oexistence) has &lt;strong>always two factors. vyapyam (smoke) and vyapakam (agni).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The vyapam in the vyaptivakyam alone becomes the hetu in the anumanavyakam. The vyapakam alone becomes becomes sadhyam. Therefore either &lt;em>yaytra yatra vyapyam tatra tatra vyapkam&lt;/em>. Or &lt;em>yatra yatra hetutu tatra tatra sadhyam&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>Only if vyaptivakyam is valid, then alone the anunamana vyakyam will be valid. The only means of validating the vyaptivakyam is perception.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A scientist is using only this method alone. Inference is based on observed data alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The conclusion that we arrive at will only about that objects from where data has been collected.&lt;/strong> Data (hetu) and conclusion (sadhyam) will with the same object (paksha). If I collect some data from my blood therefore I&amp;rsquo;m healthy/sick, not my mother.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Science is collecting data on the world. All observed data deal with anatma. Therefore if scientific reasoning is used, all the scientific conclusions will be about anatma. Therefore entire scientific reasoning is called laukika anumanam. Therefore &lt;strong>scientific reasoning has no access to atma vidya.&lt;/strong> Tarka can never prove anything in regard to atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both laukika and sastriya anumana involve data collection. &lt;strong>Difference is with regard to the source of data: observation vs. sastram. Because we as astikas accept sastram as another valid means of collecting data.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A scientist might question the conclusion but no scientist questions the observations. The whole science is based on the assumption that observation is valid, truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the sastric anumanam the reason (hetu) be based on sastram, in the scientific on observation. &lt;strong>For sastriya anumanam the student must be astika&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Laukika anumanam is never used for establishing Vedanta. It cannot prove nor disprove vedantic teaching.&lt;/strong> Some nastika philosophers wrongly use laukika anumanam to disprove vedanta - wrong field. &lt;strong>Vedantin uses scientific reasoning to show the fallacy of scientific reasoning used by other philosophers to disprove Vedanta.&lt;/strong> We use logic not to prove that vedanta is logical but to prove that it is not illogical.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="07--adhyasabhasyam">07 ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Both anumanani are dependant on data and do not question the validity of the data.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each of them has got different field, perception (anatma) vs sastra (atma). Neither of them can prove or disprove the other. We only use laukika anumanam to prove its fallacious application in establishing the illogicality of Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is not logical nor illogical, it is supralogical. Don&amp;rsquo;t use logic to prove or disprove vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other philosophies like buddhism arrive at the truth of atma or the truth of the world using laukika anumana. We want to establish that truth can never be established by using laukika anumana. Thus we use laukika anumana to disprove all their conclusions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mohammed Ali: You might be the greatest but I&amp;rsquo;m the latest. &lt;strong>Tarka can give only working knowledge of the truth. But it cannot tell me what exactly is truth. That&amp;rsquo;s why the conclusions are changed always when new data comes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use science, which is glorious, for functional knowledge. Never try to use logic or the science to know what is the truth. The truth is apaurusheya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To expect everything to fall within science and logic is to show shortsightedness. There are things which are outside the scope of science. By using scientific logic you can never cross the samshaya (doubt) sagara. 27 theories on creation. Previously I was confused, now I&amp;rsquo;m confounded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adhyasabhasyam - introduction to BS. &lt;strong>Adhyasa - error, mistake.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establishing that all human suffering is because of a mistake.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Only when the error is gone the error-caused problem is gone.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any error is because of ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the rope in front is not visible clearly, it is mistaken as snake. 5 bhutas are mistaken as Brahman in the same way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In total ignorance there is no error (ignorance is bliss). Example: sleeper. In total knowledge there is no error (knowledge is also bliss). Example: wise person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Error happens only in partial darkness and partial light. Thus there is partial knowledge. I know there is something (samanya jnanam - partial knowledge). Samanya amsha - thingness (&amp;ldquo;Is&amp;quot;ness) of the rope. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is. Samanya amsha is anavrta amsha, not covered by darkness. It is satya amsha. It&amp;rsquo;s particular part, the ropeness is covered, which is the specific feature. &amp;ldquo;Ropeness&amp;rdquo; - vishesha amsha (specific feature). It is covered - avrta amsha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;There is&amp;rdquo; part = samanya amsha = anavrta amsha = satya amsha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rope part = vishesha amsha, avrta amsha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In the place where the real vishesha amsha is covered I replace with another mithya vishesha amsha which is called snake.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In every error there is a satya amsha and a particular unreal, specific feature - vishesha amsha, because the real feature is covered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The correction is not in samanya amsha. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any. Correction takes place only in vishesha amsha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m is real. Samsari - mithya vishesha amsha. Real vishesha amsha - asamsari brahma, anandah. &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m sat, cit is evident. What is covered is ananda, ananta, asamsaritva, limitless, purnah amsha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Epistemology - study of knowledge and error.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>khyadivada - erroneous discussion of errors.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="08--adhyasabhasyam">08 ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Self-error is corrected only by self-knowledge.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three errors/knots:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>anyatha grahaman. Mistake - miss the real and wrongly take something else. That is from the standpoint of the rope.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adhyasa - superimposition. From the standpoint of the snake.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>satya anRta mithuni karanam - mixing of real and unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aim of BS: unknot sthula, sukshma, karana sharira knots.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mistake is saying &amp;ldquo;there is (real part) a snake (unreal part)&amp;rdquo;, not being aware that there are two entities.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long snake or curved snake - satya amsha because the attributes belong to the real rope.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Frightening, poisonous snake - anRta amsha because the attributes belong to the snake.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m so and so. Conscious existent being is satya amsha. Person is anRta amsha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Six topics of Adhyasa Bhasyam:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>adhyasa lakshanam - &lt;strong>definition of error: Perception of object on wrong locus. A person can never superimpose a snake if he has not seen a snake. Mixing of real and unreal. Example: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the body&amp;rdquo; - seeing the immortal, all-pervasive I, who is not the body, as the mortal, limited body -&amp;gt; error.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adhyasa shankha - objection to the theory of error from other philosophers. They say superimposition requires four conditions: a) perception - it has to be in-front of me and evident b) ignorance regarding the fact that it is the rope c) there should be a similarity d) pruva anubhava samskara - it must have been experienced before.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adhyasa shankha samadhanam - answering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adhyasa sambhavana - possibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adhyasa pramanam - proof&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adhyasa apasamhara - conclusion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantin&amp;rsquo;s counter to 2):
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a) pratyaksha-vishayatvam: For a mistake to take place the object should be known/evident. It need not be in-front, need not be pratyaksa-vishaya. Atma is evident enough. Even though it is not pratyaksha, not object, but evident as the subject. Thus first condition is prakasha manatvam (knowable), not vishayatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>b) ajna tattvam (partial covering): aham asmi - sat chit is evident but not that aham ananda ananta brahman asmi. Atmavid shokam tarati is not evident to a samsari.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>c) sadrshyam: similarity between the rope and snake. It is a general condition but there are exceptions to it. atma anatma adhyasa comes under this condition thus the rule is not required. Atma anatma are in fact diagonally opposite. Example: blue akasha. Sky looks like a vessel turned upside down. Akasha is nirupam. It is falsely superimposed. For space, there is no comparison with anything. Same for ocean.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="09--adhyasabhasyam">09 ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>d) samskara: False snake is possible only if there is experience of real snake. Thus without the experience of real anatma how can I have the samskara? Previous experience of a snake is required but it must not be a real snake. I can have an experience of a false snake which can create another false snake. Example: experience of a snake in a snake movie. First false adhyasa when? anadi avidya vasanaya. Thus real anatma is not there, unreal anatma has been there from beginning-less time.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This was just a provisional answer. The real answer: adhyasa between atma anatma is primarily based on veda pramanam. Rope snake example is not for proving adhyasa. Adhyasa is derived from sruti pramana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rope snake is just to show corollaries - secondary ideas. It is not meant to prove the adhyasa, proof is in the veda.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This adhyasa should no be questioned by these astika purvapaksis because they themselves have already accepted the adhyasa&lt;/strong> in their systems. All talk about an atma and &lt;strong>based on veda pramana they accept that I the atma is nityah. When you say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a human being&amp;rdquo; the meaning of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; is referring to the body. Similarly for &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m mortal&amp;rdquo;. Thus they accept this knowledge is an error, as deha-atma buddhi error.&lt;/strong> Sthula sharira adhyasa is accepted by all the astika systems. 2nd chapter of BS deals with nastikas. If dehatma-buddhi is not accepted as error, you&amp;rsquo;re at the carvaka level. In vedic times carvakas were criminals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All astika darshanani say - atma is all-pervading, formless, part-less, niravayam and shtula is limited, with parts. There is no similarity - sadrshyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similarly rope-snake adhyasa cannot be questioned because it is based on anubhava. How does it happen? Each philosopher has his explanation - kyativada. Advaitin: anirvacaniya. Sankaracarya says &amp;ldquo;whatever&amp;rdquo;. You all accept the adhyasa, one is based on sruti, the other on anubhava.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The quarrel is only in the extent of adhyasa. Tarquika: I&amp;rsquo;m anityam, karta, bhokta. Nyaya: anityam is superimposed, I&amp;rsquo;m karta and bhoka. Sankhya: aham anitya, aham karta are errors, bhokta is fact. Advaitin: all three are adhyastam: anityatvam, kartrtvam, bhoktrtvam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>laukika pramanam works only in anatma prapanca. Once we come to atma it has to be sastriya pramanam. Then either anumana or arthapatti pramanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arthapatti - postulation of an idea to explain a particular fact. Example: I get up and see a lot of water (proven fact) all over the street. Thus I postulate last night it must have heavily rained.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kathopanishad I - II - 19: &lt;em>If the slayer things &amp;ldquo;I slay&amp;rdquo;, and if the slain thinks, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m slain&amp;rdquo; then both of them do not know well. This slays not nor is This slain.&lt;/em> -&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not bhokta, I&amp;rsquo;m not karta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gita 5 - 15: &lt;em>Atma doesn&amp;rsquo;t take neither the punyam nor papam of anyone.&lt;/em> There is also another statement in the sruti which says atma is nirvikara (changeless). Experience, karta and bhokta require change. Thus atma cannot be neither. Thus thinking &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a kartka/bohkta&amp;rdquo; is an error.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="10--adhyasabhasyam">10 ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Arthapatti - without postulating an idea the fact cannot be explain. Even though the idea is postulated it becomes valid knowledge. Example: wet road. No doubt, it is based on perception. Postulation of the idea that in the night it must have rained. There was no experience of that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is experienced need not be postulated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Derived knowledge by arthapatti is called arthapatti prama. If it is based not on pratyaksha but on sruti it is called sruthyarta pramanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adhyasa is not directly mentioned in shruti. It is valid knowledge postulated on shruti pramanam. Example sruti says &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m immortal&amp;rdquo;. Thus &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m mortal&amp;rdquo; is adhyasa - error.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sruti says atma is akarta -&amp;gt; atma is karta must be adhyasa. Same for bhokta. E.g. see Kathopanishad I - II - 19.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m knower is another adhyasa. I&amp;rsquo;m consciousness is not superimposed. Atma is jnanam not jnata. See Mandukya Upanishad 7. Atma is not waking knower (visva), dream knower (taijasa), sleep knower (prajna). Why? Atma is nirvikarah. See BG 2 - 24.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>kartrvam, bhoktrtvam, knowing all of these require change because they are process.&lt;/strong> In sanskrit any &lt;code>ta&lt;/code>, in english any &lt;code>er&lt;/code> suffix indicate modification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any karta has to be associated with a karanam, with an instrument. Same for bhokta, same for pramata.&lt;/strong> They all have sanga with the instrument. &lt;strong>Sruti says clearly atma is asangah.&lt;/strong> If it is asangah, can it be a pramata? Thus if atma is akarta, then kartrtvam must be an error, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma means I.&lt;/strong> I mistake myself as the knower, enjoyer, knower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Parichedatvam. I&amp;rsquo;m limited, here. &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rdquo;-ness is parichedah (limitation) and that is also adhyasa.&lt;/strong> See Kathopanishad I - III - 15. &lt;strong>Limitlessness alone is called brahmatvam. Limitation is jivatvam. Jivatam is error.&lt;/strong> Aham brahma asmi is a fact, aham jivosmi is an error called adhyasa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma bahutvam is accepted by all other philosophies. Anekatvam is also an error.&lt;/strong> See Svetasvataupanishad 6 / 11 or Isavasya 7.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another method to prove adhyasa is anumanam - inference - based on co-existence of two things. Yatra yatra dhumah tatra tatra agnih. &lt;strong>Shankaracarya: any TX proves adhyasah. Yatra tatra vyavaharatvam tatra tatra adhyasthavatvam.&lt;/strong> Because atma cannot do any TX. Because atma is different from the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If the cow goes after the grass it is because it thinks I&amp;rsquo;m this body, which is hungry and grass will remove the hunger. This vyavahara is called pravrti (going after) vyavahara. It cannot happen without dehaadhyasa. Human being is not much different from cow in this aspect.&lt;/strong> He goes after nice food, goes away from fire&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>All human activities are based on adhyasa.&lt;/strong> Life is getting and getting rid of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In our transactions are two things involved. Atma and anatma. But we are not aware and in our vision there is one single mixed-up entity. Aham janami. &lt;strong>It looks like there is one single entity - Knower = chetana tattvam + jadam (vrttih) part.&lt;/strong> Chetana atma does not have modifiction. Acetana vrtti doesn&amp;rsquo;t have consciousness. &lt;strong>In every TX sat cit amsha belongs to atma, changing amsha belongs to anatma&lt;/strong>, thus all TX base on adhyasa. See atma bodha 25 and 36.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="class-11--14827---1st-sutra-athato-brahma-jijnasa">Class 11 / 14827 - 1st sutra: athato brahma jijnasa&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The entire samsara is due to this basic error alone. Because of which we enter into different types of activities because of the notion I&amp;rsquo;m karta/bhokta. Not only laukika but even vaidika karmas are based on this error alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because of this drstha adrstha phalam alone there is the punarapi jananam punarapi maranam cycle. Thus root cause of all problems of life is adhaysa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Various levels of adhyasa: 1) Primary error. I&amp;rsquo;m a pramata. Because of mixing up of atma and antahkaranam. 2) through the mind the error flows down to the sense organs -&amp;gt; secondary errors like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m blind/dumb/deaf&amp;rdquo;, which is a problem of sense organs. 3) antahkarana adhyasa -&amp;gt; indriya adhyasa -&amp;gt; sharira adhyasa. Aham strI, purushah, vrddah, sthulah, krshah, tarunah &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ahamkara adhyasa -&amp;gt; mamakara adhyasah. I belong to them, they belong to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One has to work for the removal of this adhyasa. Adhyasa itself is the product of ignorance. Self-error is born out of self-ignorance. It is not physics-, dance- nor music ignorance. Any other knowledge we gain we are not able to remove self-ignorance. Narada with a huge list of degrees approaches sanatkumara, he&amp;rsquo;s aware he&amp;rsquo;s both learned and successful but still in grasp of grief. Sanatkumara: tarati shokam atmavid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Self-error is&lt;/strong> not because of total ignorance of self. But &lt;strong>because of partial ignorance of the self.&lt;/strong> Sat is known. Cit is known. That&amp;rsquo;s why I say aham asmi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When we say brahmajnanam we are not going to know a new thing called brahman. Brahmajnanam means knowing the brahman status of mine.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the real status is not known, a false status is taken up - jivatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Correction is knowing my brahman status and displacing the jiva status. For this purpose alone begin all the &lt;strong>Upanishads. All other sastram take our inferior status as a fact, having taken it as a fact they are prescribing methods for improving the status.&lt;/strong> One of the methods is acquiring money, power. &lt;strong>Assuming that inferior status is a fact karma kanda says go to heaven and become Indra.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedanta is not for image building but for the negation of superimposed low-image&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>1st chapter: samanvaya (consistency) anvayah. 1st topic: jijnasa adhikaranam. 1st sutra: athato brahmajijnasa - &lt;em>hence (it is to be undertaken) thereafter a deliberation on Brahman&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1st sutra is introduction into brahmavidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduction is like a door of the house. It is not inside nor inside. So is introduction - a connecting link, neither inside nor inside. Like 1st chapter of BG. Not part of the sastram yet required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>anubandah - an appendix, a pre-appendix&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sastram beginns with the 2nd sutra only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An introduction to any sastram should present four factors - anubandha catustayam:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>adhikari - audience in mind, target group. The competent, eligible student for brahmavidya. For BS it is sadhana chatustaya sampatti: shreya preya viveka (discrimination), vairagya (dispassion - considering all other pursuits to be secondary), shatka sampatti (sixfold inner discipline), mumuksutvam (desire for moksha)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vishayah - the subject matter: brahman. Not a new thing but a new status of the listener atma. My own higher status.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>prayojanam - negation of abrahman status of mine which is my misconception. Brahmatvam knowledge will displace jivatvam misconception. brahmatva jnanena abrahmatva nivrtih prajoyanam. mokshah - freedom from the sense of limitation, smallness, inadequacy, want.
4 . sambandha - relationship between the textbook (BS) and the subject matter (content. Revealer (BS) - revealed (Brahman) relationship.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Passion: seeing the means as the end. Dispassion, maturity: seeing the means as means (to moksha). Foolishness: not seeing the means as means.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shatka sampatti:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>kshama - mind control&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dama - sense control&lt;/li>
&lt;li>uparama - reduction of extroverted-ness (withdrawal)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>titiksha - capacity to ignore discomforts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sraddha - faith in guru (incl. scriptures (Vedanta) and God)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samadhana - commitment on one goal&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-12--14828">Class 12 / 14828&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>upodghAta - introduction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A topic can be considered as a subject matter of a book only if the topic is discussed as the central theme of the book. Example: dietary discipline in Gita is not its subject matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anubandha catustayam is not the direct but implied meaning of the first sutram - arthika artah (indirect meaning).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>srautah artah - direct meaning: &lt;em>therefore brahman enquiry should be done&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s aim is to extract the philosophy of the upanishads not propounding a new system. Therefore, &lt;strong>whenever Vyasa writes an sutra he has in mind a particular portion of the upanishads&lt;/strong>, therefore to understand the right meaning, we should always know what is the upanishadic portion kept in mind by him. That upanishadic statement is called vishaya vakyam. &lt;strong>Without bhasyam we can never know the vishaya vakyam of many sutras.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taitriya 3 - 1 - 3: &lt;em>oh Brighu, conduct brahma enquiry to get peace, security, happiness, to get rid of boredom.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chandogya 8 - 7 - 1: &lt;em>you have to know the self&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brhadaranyaka 2 - 4 - 5: &lt;em>nobody loves anybody, everybody loves oneself alone&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>Self alone is object of love. Self alone is loved by all. Whatever is the object of love is of the nature of ananda.&lt;/strong> In the crisis we drop everything, even children.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Marriage is like a tennis game. You start with love and fight like hell later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Discovering ananda requires self-discovery.&lt;/strong> Therefore Yagnavalkya tells Maitreyi atman enquiry should be done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kartavya - should be done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This enquiry can&amp;rsquo;t be done independently because brahman is not an object in-front. You have to necessarily take the help of the upanishad-microscope&lt;/strong>. Thus we replace the word brahman enquiry and replace it with vedanta sastra vicara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Naya: paksha: vedanta sastra. sadhyam: enquired. hetu: anubandha catustayam. drsthanta: dharma sastravat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vypati: yatra yatra anubandha chatustaya vatvam, tatra tatra arambaniyatvam. Whatever sastra has anubandha chatustayam, all those satra are worth studying. Because we get the benefit of moksha out of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implied meaning: vedanta sastram has anubandha catustayam. Direct meaning: vedanta sastra should be studied.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-13--14829">Class 13 / 14829&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>atha - two fold function: sound (shabda) and word (padam). Every word has two status. Prameyam when it is listened and pramanam if you understand the language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>prayema - object of any pramanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The very sound &amp;ldquo;atha&amp;rdquo; as vibration produces auspiciousness.&lt;/strong> When it also functions as a word it is artha bhodaka - it gives meaning. Every text should begin with mangalam, if it does not, we should not read it. Therefore there is a tradition of writing a mangala shloka. Vyasa is writing BS in sutra form thus he has no opportunity to write a mangala shloka. So he uses the word &amp;ldquo;aath&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Words &amp;ldquo;om&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;atha&amp;rdquo; are mangala shabda. Because Brahmaji started the wonderful creation after uttering these two words.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;atha&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> has many meanings - prajonana, mangala&amp;hellip; Here Shankaracarya chooses after analysis &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;anantaram&amp;rdquo; - thereafter, immediately after.&lt;/strong> It indicates immediacy. After what? &lt;strong>After qualification.&lt;/strong> Any study should be after yogyata siddhi anantaram. &lt;strong>For studying vedanta it means sadhana catustayam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thus atha means here sadhana catustaya anantaram. How do we know this is the meaning? a) logic. From observation we come to know that whoever has sadhana catustayam is able to get the benefit of vedantic study - moksha. On the other hand a student without sadhana catustayam doesn&amp;rsquo;t derive the benefit even if he does sravana manana nididhiasanam for a million of janmas. b) sruti. Mundako upanishad 1.2.12: learning from kicks in life what is permanent and not (viveka). Wanting the permanent (vairagyam) and going to a guru for studying (mumukshutvam). Or Yamadharmaraja tempting Naciketas to choose between sreyas and preyas. Kathopanishad 1.1.25 Samadi shatka sampatti is emphasized in Brhadaranyaka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If we are lacking the qualification vedanta becomes an academic time-pass.&lt;/strong> We&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of time and want some intellectual gymnastic &amp;hellip; It will be more information than transformation of the person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I have to grasp Vedanta like Naciketas, I should be after moksha like him and throw away dharma/artha/kama. Dropping them like kaka vistha - crow droppings. We just immediately wipe them out and don&amp;rsquo;t claim it is a great achievement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Just like purushasuktam occurs in RG veda, yajurveda, samaveda so brhadaranyaka has two versions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purva pakshi: The very word purva mimamsa indicates that it should come first (before uttara mimamsa). Thus you should translate &amp;ldquo;atha&amp;rdquo; as purva mimamsa anantaram. Shankaracarya refutes that after purva mimamsa alone one should come to uttarama mimasa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>vyabicara dosha (lack of consistency). &lt;strong>Even after a thorough study of purva mimamsa a person might not have sadhana catustaya sampatti.&lt;/strong> Thus unqualified person might enter Vedanta, esp. thinking that after purva uttara should come automatically.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-14--14830">Class 14 / 14830&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are rare &lt;strong>cases where person is born with sadhana catustaya sampati in a reasonable measure. They do not require purva mimamsa, why should they waste time with rituals?&lt;/strong> Thus sadhana catustaya sampati is compulsory for all, not karma khaNDa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Shankaracarya&amp;rsquo;s time there was the idea prevalent that pure knowledge cannot give moksha. That jnana must be combined karma - jnana karma samudcayena (combination) mokshah by jnana karma samudcaya vadi. Thus Sankaracarya gives 3 more reasons:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>karma khanda jnana khanda vishaya bheda. The subject matter of these two is diagonally opposite, therefore cannot be combined.&lt;/strong> Combination is possible only when subjects are similar. But: sadhyam vs. siddham. Anamta vs atma. Extroverted dependence on the world vs introverted self-dependence. anitya phalam vs nitya phalam. Full of sangha vs neti neti. Avidya vs vidya. Preyas vs sreyas &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>prajoyana bheda - benefit is also different. Anitya phalam which falls within samsara, vs anitya phalam which is moksha. &lt;strong>South is presided by Yamadharmaraja who has kala (mrtyu) in his hand. North is presided by Soma Devata with amruta in hand.&lt;/strong> Karmakhanda is going southwards, jnanakhanda is going northwards.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>pravrti bheda - functional difference. &lt;strong>karmakanda always incites a person into action, achievement oriented.&lt;/strong> First tempts for phalam and then gives the ritual to achieve it. &lt;strong>Jnanakanda&lt;/strong> doesn&amp;rsquo;t tempt by providing various goals, it says &lt;strong>whatever you want to accomplish is your very nature. In you, brahmananda, all others anandas are included. The one who has discovered brahman has accomplished everything in life. Having known that I&amp;rsquo;m that purnah (and akarta) what temptation will he have? It makes a person so contented that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to accomplish anything.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scriptural refutation of purva paksi&amp;rsquo;s view: Sankaracarya wants to establish that karmakhanda and jnanakhanda are not in krama (sequence). So he says there is no vedic reference for this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If many rituals have to be done simultaneously they have to be done by many people since one person can do only one at a time. &lt;strong>Thus simultaneity requires many performers.&lt;/strong> Whereas where many rituals have to be done by one persons they will have to be done one after the other. &lt;strong>Ekakartatvam is the condition for krama&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three conditions (any of these) indicates ekakartrtatvam:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>eka pradhana sheshatvam - if many rituals are subsidiary (part) to one main ritual, which one person wants to perform. Example washing the hands and eating the food.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sheshasheshitvam - one main, one subsidiary ritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adhikrta adhikaratvam - two main rituals. A person is qualified if he has done one rituals he becomes qualified to do the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-15--14831">Class 15 / 14831&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gist of the previous technical discussion: there is no veda pramanam to prove that purva mimamsa is compulsory for the study of vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brhadaranyaka 4.4.22: &lt;em>That great, birthless Self which is identified with the intellect and is in the midst of the organs, lies in the ether that is within the heart. It is the controller of all, the lord of all, the ruler of all. It does not become better through good work nor worse through bad work. It is the Lord of all, It is the ruler of all beings, It is the protector of all beings. It is the bank that serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds apart. The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas, sacrifices, charity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects. Knowing It alone one becomes a sage. Desiring this world (the Self) alone, monks renounce their homes . This is (the reason for it); The ancient sages, it is said, did not desire children ( thinking ), &amp;ldquo;What shall we achieve through children, we who have attained this Self, this world ( result ). &amp;ldquo;They, it is said , renounced their desire for progeny, for wealth and for the worlds, and lived a mendicant life. That which is the desire for progeny is the desire for wealth, and that which is the desire for wealth is the desire for the worlds, for both these are but desires. This self is That which has been described as &amp;ldquo;Not this, not this&amp;rdquo;. It is imperceptible, for It is never perceived; undecaying, for It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered — It never feels pain, and never suffers injury. (It is but proper) that the sage is never overtaken by these two thoughts, &amp;ldquo;I did an evil act for this&amp;rdquo; , and &amp;ldquo;I did a good act for this&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If purva mimamsa is not compulsory then what is compulsory? Sadhana catustaya smapatti. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter in which janma it was acquired.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thus &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;atha&amp;rdquo; here directly means &amp;ldquo;sadhana catustaya sampati anantaram&amp;rdquo;, indirectly &amp;ldquo;adhikari&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>atah shabda vicara: atah - therefore.&lt;/strong> The word &amp;ldquo;therefore&amp;rdquo; indicates that there must be some reason for brahman enquiry to be conducted. Sankaracarya gives two reasons:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>karma cannot give moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jnanam alone gives moksha&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sruti pramanam, see e.g.: Kaivalya Upanishad. Yukti: samsara nivrti can happen only through jnanam, because samsara is superimposed. How do you destroy rope-snake? Samsara is adhyasa because of atma-anatma aviveka there is jivatmabuddhi, paricheda buddhi, I&amp;rsquo;m husband etc. Anubhava: any superimposed problem, like rope-snake, can go only by knowledge. Sruti: Mandukya: 2 - K - 32&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Indirectly &amp;ldquo;atah&amp;rdquo; signifies prayojanam. Atah shabda vicara is over.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now &lt;strong>brahmajijnasa. Final meaning is &amp;ldquo;brahman enquiry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. There are three parts: brahma, jijna, sa.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;brahma&amp;rdquo; here means saytam jnanam anantam brahman jagat karanam based on the 2nd sutra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;jijna&amp;rdquo; here means jnanam. vrdha aparoksha jnanam of brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;sa&amp;rdquo; - direct meaning: iccha, desire. &lt;strong>In sanskrit &amp;ldquo;sa&amp;rdquo; pratyaya conveys the meaning of desire&lt;/strong> (desiderative usage). Indirect meaning (lakshyartha), which is to be taken here is &amp;ldquo;enquiry&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-enquiry should not be understood as independent enquiry, but with the help of guru and sastra. Vedanta alone is the pramanam for brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-16--14832">Class 16 / 14832&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Brahmajnana iccha = brahmajnana vedanta vicara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Q: Why do you introduce Vedanta here? A: Any knowledge can be obtained only by the operation of appropriate pramanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mere enquiry, mere independent thinking, mere sitting in meditation are not accepted as one of the six pramanams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If a person goes into enquiring into brahman without using any pramanam, it will lead only to speculation, hypothesis. Never to knowledge.&lt;/strong> Here only upnishad shabda pramanam is the pramanam, as Vyasa says in the 3rd sutra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any adhyasa is removed by ts adhisthana jnanam.&lt;/strong> yatra yatra adhyastattvam tatra tatra sva adhisthana jnanam nirvartyatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma is adhisthanam of samsara. Purvapakshi: we should be conducting atma jijnasa, how com Vyasa writes brahman? Brahman is the same as atman. See Taittriya 3 - 1 - 3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brahman is not a new substance to be revealed by the scriptures.&lt;/strong> This is the biggest mistake a seeker commits. &lt;strong>It is a new status of the already available substance called aham.&lt;/strong> My para prakrti. Now I&amp;rsquo;m lost in apara prakrti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Old vs. new status: jeevatam/abrahmatvam vs. brahmatvam, samsaritvam vs. mokshatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4th word supplied by us &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;kartavyah&amp;rdquo; - should be done. It should be understood as srotavyah, mantavyah, niddidhyasitavyah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>-tavyah indicates imperative mood in sanskrit grammar.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Final meaning: sadhana catustaya sampatti anantram brahmajnanaya vedanta sravana manana niddidhiasanani kartavyani yasmat brahma jnanaya eva moksha, na tu karmanah. After acquiring the four-fold qualification one should do sravana, manana, niddidhiasanam for the sake of brahmajnanam because it alone gives moksha, not karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What to do depends on the status of the student. There is no universal advise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example illumination: wire connection (sadhana catustaya sampatti) + fixing the bulb (vedanta).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technical format used in sutra literature. 5 stages for each adhikaranam (topic):
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>adhikaranam: jijnasa adhikaranam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>viSaya (subject matter, domain): vedanta sastram&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vizayah (samshayah, doubt): should we study or not? Purva pakshi: it is not worth studying, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anubandha catustyam, unlike darma-/tarkasastram.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>siddhantah (our conclusion): adhikaris are there but don&amp;rsquo;t say not there, see BG 7 / 3. Brahman is there because it is yourself. Many have attained moksha, therefore there is prayojanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sangatih (connection of this topic with the previous topic): not there. Only the later sutras will have.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purvapakshi - anybody opposed to us vedantins, e.g. sankhya philosopher.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-17--14833---2nd-sutra-janmadasya-yatah">Class 17 / 14833 - 2nd sutra: janmadasya yatah&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2nd sutra is the beginning of the sastram. Just like in Gita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd sutra is in the 2nd adhikaranam again with one sutra only. Janmadhi adhikaranam. Topic is brahma lakshanam - definition of brahman. Therefore this sutra is called &lt;strong>brahmalaksanasutram.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any object is established only through lakshanam and pramanam.&lt;/strong> Only if it is established, siddham, only then you can make further enquiry about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Analysis presupposes siddhi, the existence or the knowledge of the vastu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman is not unknown. It is known through veda pramana. The very word brahman indicates the existence of an entity. The very word tells me it is big - infinitely. Bhr-dhatu indicates expansion or bigness. Here it is not adjective but noun, thus it is the bigness it self. Since there is no other word to condition the &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; it is unconditionally big, infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In scriptures, adjectives are converted to noun to indicate absolute not relative.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yet I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced only limited, time and space bound objects thus to remove the doubt of its existence the sastra tells me it is &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doubting existence of Brahman is doubting self existence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Doubter cannot be doubted. Nobody says &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not there&amp;rdquo;. Therefore there is no doubt regarding self existence, which is the same brahman existence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purvapakshi: if brahman is already known, why make enquiry? Who am I is not clear&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear knowledge of myself, because different philosophers have different contentions.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Carvaka: I&amp;rsquo;m the body, mind is not a substance but electrical phenomenon of the brain. Fused brain means the fellow is dead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddhist: mind is atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Naiyayika: body and mind are not atma. There is a self beyond these. That atmas are many, each individual has one, so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have quarrel. Example: soccer match. 22 people fighting for a ball. Just give a ball to everybody and there is no fight. Each atma is infinite atma, karta and bhokta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sankhya and Yoga philosopher: many atmas, all are all-pervading. But atmas are not karta, only bhokta. Body and mind do action, the atma enjoys.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta: &lt;strong>atma ekah, sarvagatah, akarta, abhokta. Regarding atma there are so many confusions thus enquiry is required. Because brahman is neither completely known nor unknown, but vaguely/unclearly known.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lakshanam (definition) is of two types:&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>svarupa&lt;/strong> - object is defined through its intrinsic feature. Examples: Awareness. Moon&amp;rsquo;s brightness is always experienced when you see it thus it is its intrinsic feature. &lt;strong>It is that intrinsic feature which reveals or define an object.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tatastha&lt;/strong> (that which remains on the bank of the river; aloof; away) - object defined through its incidental, temporary feature not intrinsic to the object. Examples: Jagat karanam brahman. The house with a crow sitting on it among several same looking ones. &lt;strong>vyavartakam - that which specifies, pinpoints.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tatah - bank of a river&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sthaha - remaining&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>2nd sutra is presenting the tatastha lakshanam of brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Context helps in adhyahara (inference). Here: &lt;strong>janmadasya yatah&lt;/strong> (tat brahma bavati) - brahman is that from which the origin, sustenance, resolution of the world takes place. In simple sanskrit: jagat sristhi sthiti laya karanam brahma.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-18--14834">Class 18 / 14834&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>janmadhi - sristhi stithi layah (bangam)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>asya - of this&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yatah - cosmos / universe / world&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Final meaning: &amp;ldquo;brahman is that cause from which cause the origin etc. of the universe takes place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we prove the existence of brahman through lakshanam thereafter we can talk about enquiry into brahman. Brahma vicara (1st sutra talks about) is impossible without brahma siddhi (2nd sutra talks about).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In BS no idea is Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s, he&amp;rsquo;s only analysing upanishads&amp;rsquo; sutras. Here he&amp;rsquo;s got Taittriya 3 - 1 - 3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>janmadhi = janma (birth) + adhi (etc.)&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Objection 1: Every objects in the creation goes through janmadi shatkam (in book called nirukta by Yaska). Therefore purva puskhi suggests it should be interpreted as janmadi shatkam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Niruktam - science of etymology. See mundaka 1 - 1 - 5. &lt;strong>Yaska cannot talk about the origin of akasha, vayu &amp;hellip; because he himself came later. Therefore his discussion is confined to bhautika prapanca, i.e. objects within the creation like a tree, wall etc.&lt;/strong> Therefore since the context is bhutabautika prapanca his discussion is irrelevant in the discussion of jagat karanam brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Answer 1: All smrti grantas are purusheya grantas but enjoying apaurusheya status because they are based on shruti paranam. Thus Shankara&amp;rsquo;s comment based on sruti vakyam has original validity, Yaska&amp;rsquo;s vakyam has borrowed validity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Answer 2: Purpose of BS is analysis of vedanta vakyani. Thus the very name indicates the stated purpose. Yaska&amp;rsquo;s statement is from nirukta, not vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Objection 2: You say that sristhi stithi laya are a cyclic process. Thus you cannot say which one is the beginning. But the word adhi in Sanskrit literally means &amp;ldquo;beginning with&amp;rdquo;. Etcetera is only secondary meaning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Answer 1: Talking about any object in creation presupposes the destruction. Only existing thing can have destruction. Existence presupposes the origin of a thing. &lt;strong>Born (sristi) is (stiti) gone (laya)&lt;/strong> Thus you&amp;rsquo;d only say janma adhi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Answer 2: Vyasa is writing a sutra keeping sruti vyakyam in the mind. When using these three words, shruti starts with janma. So does Gita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>asya - &amp;ldquo;of this&amp;rdquo;. Vyasa has not specified any specific noun so you should include all the existing nouns. He uses &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo;. According to grammar &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; is for something that is accessible in front. Final meaning &lt;strong>asya - of this&lt;/strong> pratyaksha prapanca.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>yatah - yasmAt karanat - from which all these take place.&lt;/strong> Karanam is two fold: nimitta and upadana. The maker and the material. Both are required for any karyam to take place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since we&amp;rsquo;re referring to sristhi sthiti and laya the word karanam must refer to upadana karanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-19--14835">Class 19 / 14835&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Normally nimitta karana is responsible only for creation, nor for maintenance and destruction. Therefore intelligent cause is defined as sristhi matra karanam. Material cause is defined as sristhi, sthithi, laya karanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>janmadhi refers to sristhi, sthithi, laya, therefore yatah refers to sristhi, sthiti, laya karanam and therefore primarily it conveys upadana karanam, since there is no separate nimitta karanam we have to include nimitta karana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we are talking about the cause which is beyond desha kala, that karanam should be ekam eva advitiyam. If it has to be one, then we can say it should itself serve as upadana karanam and as there is no second thing also as nimitta karanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Final meaning of the word &lt;strong>yatah:&lt;/strong> from which material and intelligent cause the world has sristhi sthitit layam, that abinna &lt;strong>nimita upadana karanam&lt;/strong> is brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ananda is svarupam lakshanam of brahman, jagat karanatvam is tatastha of brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>yatah&amp;rdquo; further means &amp;ldquo;ananda svarupam&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> It reveals both, tatastha and svarupa lakshanam of brahman. Primarily tatastha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We supplied two more words: tat brahman. Shankara adds one more feature: &lt;strong>once we know the intelligent cause the amount of intelligence can be inferred from the nature of the product.&lt;/strong> As the product is so must be the producer or his intelligence. &lt;strong>If you see the nature of the world, its greatness, wonders, vibhuti then you can definitively conclude that Isvara is sarvajnah and sarvashaktiman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When brahman is seen as the karanam he gets the name Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adjectives describing Ishvara&amp;rsquo;s glory:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>intelligent creator: &lt;strong>Well designed universe, not accidental one. It can&amp;rsquo;t be explained as simple evolution by accident.&lt;/strong> If you have to design a simple clock, so much intelligence is required. How can you say the universe is accidental? &lt;strong>Chetana karta - intelligent being is required.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>jivabinna: This universe consists of countless jivas who are kartas and bhotkas, having countless experiences&lt;/strong>, imagine the amount of knowledge required to run this master show. Infinite intelligence - sarvajnatvam - is required. &lt;strong>By this Shankara indicates that jivas themselves fall within the creation as products and therefore the creator must be a non-jiva. He must be omniscient. Ghatasya karta ghatajnahah. Sarvasyakarta sarvajnah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>wonderful universe: &lt;strong>We find there is no accidents in the creation. Every event is an incident cause by specific time (kala), place (desha) and reason (nimitta). That&amp;rsquo;s why the world is a cosmos, not a chaos.&lt;/strong> There are certain events that need to be designed so that one and the same event gives punya phalam of one jiva and a papa phalam of another jiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>omnipotence: A scientist can know how the brain functions, but he cannot create a brain. We might have the knowledge of function, but not the power to create it. **Ishvara has omnipotence to implement the knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What we call accident is an incident for which we do not know the reason.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhagavan implements many things which are inconceivable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Full definition of brahman: yasmat abinna nimitta upadana karanat ananda svarupat sarvajnat sarvashaktat prapancasya sristhi sthiti laya sambhavanti tat brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nayayika: 2nd sutra gives pramanam for brahman also. It defines brahman or Isvara as jagat karanam -&amp;gt; world is karyam of Isvara. Invisible Isvara can be inferred from the visible karya prapanca. Like the invisible father can be inferred from the visible solid son who&amp;rsquo;s in front of me. Thus anumanam is the pramanam for Isvara, popularly known in tarka sastra as karya lingaka anumanam. Thus nayayika&amp;rsquo;s conclusion is sastra is not required for proving Isvara, logic itself will do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantin: no. &lt;strong>Isvara cannot be established through pure logic, without the help of sastra.&lt;/strong> Sastra is primary, tarka or anumanam is secondary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-20--14836">Class 20 / 14836&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Without a specifying definition and without a revealing pramanam a thing cannot be established.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: if the 2nd sutra is providing anumana pramanam for Isvara, these BS cannot be called vedanta sutras at all. Shankara doesn&amp;rsquo;t propound a philosophy by using his reasoning power. He is using reasoning to understand the vedic teaching and derive a systematic philosophy out of the vedanta. If you say 2nd sutra is providing anumana pramanam for Isvara, then the importance will go to anumanam and it will not be a sastra based system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>BS - garland of vedanta darshanam. Flowers are vedanta vakyas. Tarka just as the invisible thread, is only hiding behind the flowers just to keep them in orderly form.&lt;/strong> Thus 2nd sutram is not independent anumanam, but to analyze vedanta vakyas. Lakshana sutra, not pramana sutra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sub-commentators: Nayayikas believe that Isvara can be logically established. Vedantins: &lt;strong>Isvara can be established through shastra alone, not through logic. Isvara can be assimilated through logic.&lt;/strong> Logic serves as the funnel for the Isvara which is coming from the sastra bottle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nayayika arrives at Isvara through three logical statements:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>jagat sakartrkam karyatvat ghatavat - world must have a creator, because it is a product. Just like a pot. Vyapti (generalization): yat yat karyam tat tat sakatrkam - whatever is product must have a creator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jagat karta isvarah jivabinnatvethih cetanatvat. Example: vyatirekena kulalavat (unlike a pot-maker). The creator must be Isvara alone, because I know there is a creator and I also know that no jiva has created this world. Whatever is conscious being other than jiva, it must be Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>isvarah sarvajnah sarvakarttvat vyatirekena kulavat. Ishvara has to be omniscient who is creator of everything unlike a pot maker who is only gatajnah (alpajnah). Yatra sarvakarttvam tatra sarvajnatvam abibhavati yoyat karta tatajnah.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So we don&amp;rsquo;t need veda but pure logic to establish Isvara. Which makes modern day scientists happy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantins: all three reasons are faulty. You can sell this reasons to not logical people but not to vedantin, he&amp;rsquo;s more logical than nayayaika. Counter argumentation:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Anumanam requires vyaptijnanam. Vyapti is gathered from pratyaksham (observation) alone. &lt;strong>A vyapti arrived at through observation will be acceptable if there is no vyabicara (exception)&lt;/strong>. Wherever there is smoke, there is fire is accepted because there is no exception. Turned around the statement will not hold true. &lt;strong>Only in the case of artificial product you&amp;rsquo;re able to prove a creator through perception.&lt;/strong> For any natural product, e.g. tree (product) in amazon jungle, you cannot prove a creator through perception.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vyapti: wherever a conscious being is involved other than jiva, it must be Isvara only. Thus in your vyapti you&amp;rsquo;re talking about a conscious being other than jiva. &lt;strong>Vyapti has to be always proved through perception - how can talk about a conscious being other than jiva proved through perception?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara is creator because he&amp;rsquo;s creator of everything. &lt;strong>Nayayika&amp;rsquo;s axiom, as he depends on perception and inference heavily: every knowledge is born out of mind&lt;/strong> - yat jnanam tat manojanyam. This contradicts &lt;strong>another statement he&amp;rsquo;s made is Isvara doesn&amp;rsquo;t have mind&lt;/strong>, as he&amp;rsquo;s asamsari.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If sastram is not there, every system of philosophy will have wonderful statements when it is taken in an isolated matter. All logically will have a very big problem if you want to tie all the statements together and consistent.&lt;/strong> Even modern science will be full of fallacies if you try to tie up the matter, the consciousness, the creation. Science is wonderful because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to analyse consciousness. &lt;strong>Science is allergic to consciousness.&lt;/strong> Therefore each system of science is trying to take away from itself. Psychologist are not able to explain so they give it on to neurologist. Neuroscientist are not able to explain therefore they give it to quantum physics.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-21--14837">Class 21 / 14837&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Isvara cannot be established by anumanam. &lt;strong>Isvara established purely by anumanam can be negated by anumanam.&lt;/strong> This is what the sub-commentators have done (in purnanandiya vyakyanam), to prove that Isvara cannot be logically established.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once the topic of truth, once the topic of God comes, never rely on logic.&lt;/strong> Yet tarka is very important for understanding Vedanta. Use tarka as a subservient means in understanding Vedanta. &lt;strong>Use it as a funnel to pour vedantic teaching.&lt;/strong> Logic blessed by shruti alone is accepted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dustarka - independent tarka without the support of sruti. Never do that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In karma khandam tarka is not very important. It has got a limited role alone.&lt;/strong> In karma khanda performance or procedures of doing are important. In karmakhanda knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t produce the result.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Misconception of many people: I learn the procedure and thereafter I have to follow the procedure and one day moksha will be produced. Shankara: Vedanta doesn&amp;rsquo;t deal with a future event to be created or processed. &lt;strong>We are not learning any procedure, technique, method through Vedanta&lt;/strong>. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to implement anything after Vedantic study. Vedanta is dealing with the accomplished fact of moksha. &lt;strong>Whole vedantic sadhana is a process of understanding, there is nothing to implement after understanding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In Vedanta understanding is an end in itself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever obstructs understanding should be knocked off and one of the main obstructions comes from intellect in the form of samshaya (doubt). Therefore &lt;strong>tarka or mananam is very important, to remove the intellectual obstacles.&lt;/strong> Tarka serves as a broomsticks when the vedantic teaching is entering the head.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The whole vedantic struggle is the clear vision of the teaching. Sruti, yukti and anubhava are all important. Our samsara is in the form of mental anubhava: lack of peace, inadequacy, smallness&amp;hellip; Therefore &lt;strong>the understanding is complete, when the samsara bhava goes away.&lt;/strong> Therefore the benefit, as opposed to karma khanda, is here and now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two extremes. One is nayayika, he gives too much importance to tarka and sruti is not given its place. In purva mimamsaka sruti is important tarka is rejected. In vedanta surti is given importance, yukti also is given importance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conclusion of 2nd sutra:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>adhikaranam: janmadhi adhikaranam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>viSaya: brahma lakshanam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vizayah: Asti va nasti va? Purva pakshi: no definition. Definition is given through the unique feature of the object. How can featureless brahman have an unique feature? Even though brahman is really featureless we can define brahman trhough superimposed features, through mithya features. Through the superimposed feature of snake I can define rope as the adhisthanam. Similarly, &lt;strong>through the superimposed jagat brahman can defined as jagat karanam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>siddhanta: asti&lt;/li>
&lt;li>connection (akshepa sangatih): we prove the existence of brahman by giving the lakshanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-22--14838">Class 22 / 14838&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2nd sutra is the foundation sutra of the entire vedanta sastram.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Svarupa lakshanam: defining through intrinsic, innate features. satyam jananam anantam brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tatastha lakshanam: indirect definition through some extraneous feature which is not internal part. Jagat karanam brahman. Jagat adhisthanam brahman. Brahman is revealed through jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why did Vyasa choose tatastha do define brahman? &lt;strong>In the case of brahman, at least initially, tatastha lakshanam is easier to understand than svarupa lakshanam.&lt;/strong> In tatastha we&amp;rsquo;re taking the external features which are clearly visible. &lt;strong>Through the known to the unknown&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Satyam is not visible, jnanam is not experiencable, anantam is not known to me.&lt;/strong> Therefore svarupa lakshanam will be useful after using tatasta lakshanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the upanishad sometimes brahman is presented as the material cause of the universe. But sometimes maya or prakrti is the material cause (e.g. svetaasvatara upanishad 4 / 5, 10). BG 13 says: prakrti and purusha are two beginningless principles and creation has come out of prakrti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cetana brahma karanatvam uktam na tu acetana prakrti karanatvam. Why did Vyasa choose cetana brahman as material cause?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vyasa wants to clearly differentiate vedantic teaching from sankhya philosophy.&lt;/strong> In most of BS Vyasa wants to separate himself from Sankhya - main opponent. Sankhya is very close to Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Purusha and Prakrti are commons word in both but definition is different.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The very word Sankhya is used to indicate vedantic teaching. BG Chapter 2 - title is &amp;ldquo;Sankhya yoga&amp;rdquo;. They might appear to be the same but Vyasa wants to show they are different. &lt;strong>Sankhya says prakrti is the material cause of the universe. Vyasa to differentiate says brahman is the material cause.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>In all of the systems of philosophy one of the &lt;strong>basic questions is about the material origin of the universe.&lt;/strong> Even in science: unified theory - TOE - theory of everything. They want to arrive at one basic stuff for matter. Even energy they are not able to accept because the energies are many. &lt;strong>Most of the philosophies arrive at a basic material cause and you find all of them are acetana material cause.&lt;/strong> Material cause is the matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For Sankhya and Yoga it is the acetana prakrtih. Consciousness is a parallel reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nyaya and Vaysheshika: basic material cause is atom - paramanu vada. Very close to our science. And paramanu is acetanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Skandas in Buddhism, astikaya in Jainism &amp;hellip; acetana karana vada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modern science assumes matter alone as fundamental. According to Big Bang theory life, thus consciousness, is of very recent origin. And consciousness has originated from matter. &lt;strong>Acetana karana vada.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Nyaya Vaisheshika: 9 types of matter - like elements and one of these is atma. Consciousness comes and goes in the atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Uniqueness of Vedanta teaching is cetana karana vada, where the spirit excels matter. Consciousness is&lt;/strong> not equal to matter, not subservient to matter, but &lt;strong>superior to matter. The fundamental substance, basic stuff, basic content.&lt;/strong> If you crush the universe (stone, mike, taperecorder) in a mixie, the sarah will be caitanyam, in other philosophies matter. &lt;strong>Matter crushed is caitanyam, caitanyam diluted is matter.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>In the upanishads brahman alone is predominantly shown as the material cause, only in few places prakrti is presented as the material cause.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Both cetana brahman and acetana prakrti as presented as material cause. Is this not contradictory? If one is correct, the other must be wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Both statements are correct. Purusha is upadana karanam is correct. Prakrti is upadana karanam is also correct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to the upanishads &lt;strong>prarkti does not exist independent of purusha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Since maya is nonseparate from brahman, whatever is attributed to maya, can be attributed to brahman also. Saying prakrti is the karanam is as good as saying brahman is the karanam.&lt;/strong> Prakrti is based on brahman. Prakrti borrows the very existence from brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Vedanta prakrti is parinami upadana karanam, brahman is vivarta upadana karanam - that which lends existence to parinami upadana karanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In Sankhya philosophy prakrti is independent of purusha.&lt;/strong> This is the basic difference between Sankhya and Vedanta. Therefore prakrti&amp;rsquo;s actions cannot be attributed to purusha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman lends existence to prakrti and through prakrti it lends existence to whole creation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>eka vijnaneya sarva vijnanam - by knowing one, one can know everything else&lt;/strong>. See Mundaka I - I - 3. Upadana karanena vijnanena sarva karya vijnanam bhavati - by knowing one material cause, all products are known. Because products do not exists separate from the material cause.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-23--14839---3rd-sutra-sastrayonitvat">Class 23 / 14839 - 3rd sutra: sastrayonitvat&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Uniqueness of Vedanta is that it presents consciousness as the very material cause of the universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Sankhya prakrti and purusha are totally different. You cannot interchange them. &lt;strong>In Vedanta prakrti and purusha can be interchanged because ultimately there is no prakrti separate from purusha.&lt;/strong> Thus prakrti karana vada is as good as brahman karana vada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ekajnah sarvajnah bhavati is impossible in Sankhya because prakrti is the karanam and prapanca is the karyam. In Sankhya philosphy eka karana prakrti vijnanena karya prapanca vijnanam bhavati brahma vijnanam naiva bhavati, because purusha is neither karanam nor karyam in Sankhya philosphy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3rd sutra: &lt;strong>sastrayonitvat&lt;/strong>. Also happens to be one adhikaranam: satra yoni.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This sutra is an example for visvatomukatvam - having many faces / facets / interpretations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This sutra confirms the omniscience of brahman&lt;/strong> which is indirectly revealed in the 2nd sutra. brahma sarvajnatvam drdhayati.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd sutra - brahman is sarva karanam. From this direct meaning we can derive an indirect meaning. Ghatasya karta, gatajnah -&amp;gt; sarvasya karta, sarvajnah. &lt;strong>Karta means one with jnanam.&lt;/strong> Brahman is nimitta karanam of verything - omniscient. &lt;strong>Knowledge always belongs to the nimitta karanam, karta&lt;/strong>. This indirectly expressed omniscient is confirmed in the 3rd sutra by pointing out that brahman is the creator of vedas also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sastrayoni = vedakarta&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd sutra - brahman is nimitta karanam of artha prapancha (objective universe), in 3rd sutra of shabda prapanca (veda shabdanam abhikarta).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya: Veda contains all knowledge. There is no branch of science which is not in the Veda. Veda consists of para vidya as well as apara vidya. &lt;strong>Veda itself is considered sarvajnah&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedas which are available now are only an insignificant portion. Much of the Vedas is lost in time. &lt;strong>Samaveda had 1000 branches. Now only 2 or 3 are left.&lt;/strong> Even since Shankaracarya lived (~ 1200 years ago) many of his quotations we can&amp;rsquo;t find in the current Vedas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vypati: &lt;strong>The author of a work always know more than is content of the work.&lt;/strong> You can never express everything that you know in verbal form. Expressed portion &amp;lt; known portion - yah yasya grantasya karta sah tatah adhikajnanavan. Brahma sarvajnam veda karttvat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is accepted Vedas are anadi, apaurusheyam. Not created by anyone. So how can you say brahman has created them? &lt;strong>It does not mean brahman intellectually invented the Vedas. Vedah is creation of no intellect. This vedic teaching was already there in potential form. Brahman only brought this teaching to manifestation.&lt;/strong> Exactly like the creation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Job of brahman is not producing the world, but only manifesting.&lt;/strong> Same for veda sastram. It was not created by him, it is anadi, in him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nyaya: bhagavan creates vedas. Vedanta: bhagavan manifested already existent Vedas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3d sutra is based on Brhadaranyaka 2 - 4 - 10 (maitreyi brahmanam). Examples:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>sristhi: agni (smoke coming out of fire w. wet fuel)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sthiti: dundubi (drum beat)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>laya: samudra (all rivers merge into ocean)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In all others sristhi statements in upanishads the brahman is said to be creator of the world. Here also of the vedas. &lt;strong>Creation (manifestation) of the universe and the Vedas is like breathing for brahman. Effortless, not even aware.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Word analysis: sastram + yoni. Sastra means entire Vedah (purva and anta bhaga). &lt;strong>shatanat (commandment, teaching) trayate (protects) iti sastram.&lt;/strong> In purva bhaga we get commandments and punishments. In veda antah bhaga there are no commandments, only revelation of the fact - &lt;strong>you&amp;rsquo;re already free, brahman. You need not work for one thing. Moksha. For all other things you need to work.&lt;/strong> Through commanding and teaching Vedah protects from samsara. yoni (in this context): nimitta karanam, karta, author.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 factors:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>viSaya: brahman&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samshaya: brahman vedasya karta va na va?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>purva paksha: na vedasya karta. Why? vedasya anaditvat, vedasya nityatvat, it need not be created at all. What is created is anityam. If veda is nityam, how can it be said to be created?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>siddhanta: Veda is anadi, yet &lt;strong>we talk about the beginning because it has got a state of manifestation and unmanifestation exactly like the world.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s why say the &lt;strong>whole Veda in unmanifested state is omkara&lt;/strong>. Taitriya 1 - 4 - 1: by churning the vedas brahjami took the butter, the essence - omkara. &lt;strong>Shabda is akasha guna (property), veda was in akasha and that akaksha was in brahman. akasha is brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sangatih: akshepa sangatih - this adhikaranam answers an object raised based on the previous adhikaranam. In the previous adhikaranam brahman is said to be sarvakaranam. Based on that objection is raised: sarvakaranam but the vedas.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saram: brahman&amp;rsquo;s omniscience is reinforced by way of negating the objection raised by purva mimamsaka.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-24--14840">Class 24 / 14840&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>brahman is omniscient because he&amp;rsquo;s the author of the vedas. Veda deals with all the topics under the sun, thus is as good as sarvajnam. And the author must know even much more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vyasa doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept anumanam as pramanam for brahman. Veda clearly says brahman cannot be known through tarka (Kathopanishad 1 - 2 - 9), i.e. logic, inference. Veda sastram alone is pramanam for brahman. This is conveyed through the 3d sutra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sastrayonitvat means sastravishayatvat. &lt;strong>Brahman cannot be the subject matter of logic, it is the subject matter of Vedanta alone.&lt;/strong> It is beyond logic. Like punya. Punya is also subject matter of sastra alone. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is called adrstha vishayah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1st interpretation. Sastrayoni - author of the vedas. Vishaya vakyam - sruti statement, based on which this topic is discussed: Brhandaranyaka 2 - 4 - 10.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd interpretation. Sastrayoni - subject matter of the vedas. Vishaya vakyam: Brhadaranyaka 3 - 9 - 26: tam tu aupanishadam purusham priccami. Part of the debate between Yagnavalkya and Shakalya. Yagnavalkya asks about nirguna brahman (purusha). He uses the adjective &lt;strong>aupanishadam - upanishadam eka vedyam&lt;/strong> - that which can be known only through upanishads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shakala lost his head. It burst - his ego was deflated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd meaning of yoni - pramanam, 1st was karta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grammatical difference: Poet and king example (lokanatah). Master of the world vs. one for whom the world is the master.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1st interpretation is tatpurusha samasa: sastrasya karta&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd interpretation is bahuvrihi samasa: sastram yonih pramanam yasya (sastra is the means of knowledge). Brahman is that for which sastram is the pramanam. Therefore it is not available for anumanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 factor presentation of adhikaranam:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>viSaya: cetana jagat karanam brahman&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samshaya: doubt &lt;strong>(always remember pendulum). It will always have two or more opinions.&lt;/strong> anumana vedyam va na va. Is brahman knowable through anumanam or not? Logic means science. Thus &lt;strong>can consciousness be studied by any material science?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>purva pakshi: brahman is within the scope of science because it is the cause of the universe, just like clay which is the cause of pot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>siddanta (always Vyasa): brahman can be known through sastra alone. Like dharma. Definition of Veda by Sayanacarya: Veda is that which gives the knowledge of such a subject matter, which is not available for any other means of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sangatih: connection between 2nd and 3rd sutra. eka palatatva sangatih. Both adhikaranam have a common goal, phalam, which is brahma siddhi. First Vaysa has to establish brahman (brahma siddhi), only then one can enquire into that brahman - 1st sutra (one should enquire into brahman).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If one has not the definition of moon, he will not be able to say what whether there is moon or not even if he sees the moon. He&amp;rsquo;s got the pramanam but not laskaham. If lakshanam is there but not pramanam (blind person), you also cannot talk about the moon. Brahma siddhi: lakshanam (2nd sutra) + pramanam (3rd sutra)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman has to be enquired into, that brahman is the cause of the universe and brahman can be enquired into through vedanta pramana alone. Therefore do vedanta vicara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shantimantra: Because brahman is not available for science let me not reject brahman, let me accept the sastra and through it let me know brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-25--14841---4th-sutra-tattu-samanvayat">Class 25 / 14841 - 4th sutra: tattu samanvayat&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>brahman is nimitta + upadana karanam knowable through shastra pramanam not available for any other means of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4th sutra, which is also the entire 4th adhikaranam: &lt;strong>tattu samanvayat&lt;/strong>. Name of the adhikaranam: samanvayadhikaranam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>General analysis: this is the &lt;strong>key sutra based on which entire 1st chapter&lt;/strong> (134 sutras in total) of BS is developed. The following 130 sutras are elaboration of this sutra alone. Based on this sutra 1st chapter is called samanvayAdhyAya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>2nd sutra is the foundation of entire BS&lt;/strong> (Chapters 1 -4).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the two meanings of 3rd sutra: sastra vishayatvat - brahman is the central theme of vedanta shastram. How do we know this is the central theme?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sastram can have only one central theme. If there are more it is a defect - vakya bheda dosha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Author is not around to clarify what is the central theme, hence contradiction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>samanvaya - condition to prove what is the central teaching, consistency&lt;/strong>, importance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whichever team has six factors of proof - shad lingyani, that team enjoys importance, thus becomes the central theme. Vyasa: brahman is the central theme of vedanta sastram, because it enjoys importance, consistency, harmony. &lt;strong>brahman is vedanta sastra vishaya (central theme) because it enjoys importance just like dharma in purva bhaga of the veda.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Previous three sutras had concrete upanishad vakyani as vishaya vakyani. 4th sutra has the entire vedanta sastram as vishaya vakyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Word analysis: tat - tu - samvayat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tat - that. It stands for the noun which has been discussed in the previous three sutras: brahman. Thus tat stands for: vicaryam jagat karanam veda kartr sarvajnam sarvashakti brahman sastra vishayah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>anuvrtti method - pulling words from previous sentences to save words. Example: Rama went to temple. Krishna also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samanvayat - because brahman enjoys consistency, importance. It is proved by six lingas:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>upakrama upasamharau - identity, oneness of the beginning and the end.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>abhyasa - repetition.&lt;/strong> Whatever is repeated, is the central theme. You repeat something for stress or emphasis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>apUrvata - whatever enjoys &amp;ldquo;newness&amp;rdquo;, is a new topic.&lt;/strong> Whatever is newly thought must be important, not what is already known.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>pahlam - fruitfulness, benefit&lt;/strong>. Nobody gives importance to what is fruitless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>arhtavAda - stuttih, stotram. Glorification.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>upapatti - reason, logic.&lt;/strong> Whatever is not logical, reasonable, rational cannot be the central theme.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shad lingaih tatparya niryayah mimamsa (analysis). &lt;strong>From sutra 5 to 134 Vyasa uses shad lingas to prove that brahman alone is the central theme.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lingam - indicator, mark, clue, proof, sign.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Standard example for study is 6th chapter of chandogya: tat tvam asi prakaranam:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>upakrama upasamharau: confirmed, beginning and end speak about brahman. Example: TV news having highlights in the beginning and main points in the end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>abhyasa: over the 6th chapter 9 times &amp;ldquo;tat tvam asi&amp;rdquo; gets repeated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>apUrvata: new is pramanantara avedyam - not known through any other pramanam, instrument of knowledge. &lt;strong>Even karma khandam does not reveal brahman, it reveals karma&lt;/strong> (surprise suprise).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-26--14842">Class 26 / 14842&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>continuing:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>apUrvata: I need not come and teach you what you already know. Chandogya example: salt in water. It is pervaded by something other than water which is not perceptible. The extra something makes the water salty, the extra something makes the body alive and sentient. &lt;strong>Brahman is the salt of life.&lt;/strong> Further:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Brahman is the unique prameyam for vedanta. Vedanta is the unique pramanam for brahman. Therefore they are made for each other. 4th sutra established the 3rd sutra.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>phalam: we find &amp;ldquo;brahmavit apnoti param&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>arthavAdah: glorification by &amp;ldquo;eka vijnanena sarva vijnanam bhavati&amp;rdquo;. Kathopanishad: one who is in duality will travel from death to death. One who dies without getting brahmajnanam is an unfortunate person. Whereas one who dies after brahmajnanam he alone is brahmanah. &lt;strong>Brahmastutti is also arthavAda, anyaninda is also arthavada&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>upapatti: Upanishad wants to show that it is not illogical, not dogmatic, not blind belief. It has got the support of the logic also. &lt;strong>Upanishad: brahma satyam jagat mithya. Entire prapancha is a product and no product has an independent existence.&lt;/strong> For mandah students: vacarambhanam vikaro nama dheyam mrtikA eva satyam. For a pot clay alone is satyam. Pot is mere nama rupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore, Vedanta is pramanam for brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Analysis of the most important word of the sutra: &lt;strong>tu - alone&lt;/strong> (in this context).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avadhAranam - emphasis. &lt;strong>Any time you emphasize you are indirectly negating.&lt;/strong> Every emphasis involves negation - vyAvRttiA. &lt;strong>Shankaracarya: by using the word &amp;ldquo;tu&amp;rdquo; Vyasa is negating all other interpretations, all other purvapakshis, who claim that the subject matter is not brahman but something else.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are six astika darshanam. Thus there are five purva paksas, we reduce them to three:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>sankhya - yoga:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>have common philosophy, are practically the same&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yoga concentrates on practice: discipline of ashtanga yoga&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sankhya concentrates on theory&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nyaya - vaysheshika: again, are essentially the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>purva mimamsa:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>analysed by Jaimini maharshi who was disciple of Vyasa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rituals, useful for material benefit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Useful for gaining chitta-suddhi. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s called dharma sastram. Thus not really a purva paksha. But we emphasize that purva mimamsa cannot give moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Famous commentary by Shabara - Shabara bashyam - where he admits it cannot give moksha. Later commentaries changed this into only purva mimamsa can give moksha. Then later to &amp;ldquo;vedanta is useless&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vyasa looks at sankhya yoga as the most powerful purvapaksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rest of 1st chapter, sutra no. 5 to 134 is a commentary on &amp;ldquo;tu&amp;rdquo;. Even in the 2nd chapter he goes on refuting sankhya. Vyasya look at nyaya - vaisheshika as weak opponent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-27--14843">Class 27 / 14843&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>4th word need to be supplied for completion of 4th sutra: sastrayoni. Full reading: &lt;strong>tat tu sastrayonit samanvayat&lt;/strong> - that brahman is subject matter of vedanta because it has got importance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vishistaadvaitam and dvaitam are two commentaries on BS, they cannot become purva paksha&lt;/strong>. Vishishtaadvaita, dvaita and advaita are &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rdquo; of Vyasa. All three are one and the same Vedanta darshanam only, all three are Vedantins. Dispute among these three is an internal dispute - yAdavIya kalaham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya deals with nyaya - vaisheshika reasonable elaborately in 2nd chapter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Main source of purva mimamsa sastram are the sutras of Jamini. Famous Shaabara bashyam is accepted and quoted by Shankara. Both are seen as complimentary to Vedanta, because dharma alone gives sadhana catustaya sampatti.&lt;/strong> Purva mimamsa became purva paksha only with commentaries to Shaabara bashyam by Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhakarah. Thus we&amp;rsquo;ve got two types of purva mimamsa bhAtta mimamsa and prAbhatara mimamsa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BS classes are not compulsory for all. Those who want to know more about the purva paksha and those who want to know how vedanta refutes they alone need to come to BS. Otherwise Gita and Upanishads are more than sufficient.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Common views to both bhAtta matam and prabhatara matam:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All the vedic statements can be broadly classified into two: a) siddha bodhaka vakyani - statements of facts. b) karya bodhaka vakyani - statements of commandments. Statements of facts will give knowledge alone. Statements of action (commandments) will lead to action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>siddha bhodaka vakyani do not give any benefit to us. Jnanam does not help us to accomplish anything. &lt;strong>Knowing itself is not an accomplishment, thus jnanam is useless&lt;/strong>. If I know there is a heaven, I only feel more miserable. Purusharta is either sukha prapti or dukha nivrtti, jnanam does not give any benefit. Karya bodhana vakyani gets you to do something and only by that we get some purusharta or the other. &lt;strong>Let any amount of vedantic study take place, students always ask the question: Swamiji what should I do hereafter? Swamiji give me a practical lifestyle, so that I can do. Give me a daily routine. Every student asks for doing something because he feels he&amp;rsquo;s not benefited from the study.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM (purva mimamsaka) agree that Veda is a pramanam. If bauddhas are driven out of India, the credit goes to PM. &lt;strong>pramanam - anadhigata (unrevealed) abhAdita (unnegated) artha bhodakam (revelear)&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If Veda reveals whatever is revealed by science then Veda becomes apramanam. &lt;strong>To enjoy the status of pramanam it has to reveal something which is beyond the scope of science, logic and all the sense organs.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>abhAditam: something not contradicted by other pramanam. It should not contradict logic neither. It should be something &lt;strong>beyond logic, yet not illogical. It should not contradict science, senses, anything.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>PM adds one more condition, which is not used but is accepted by Vedantis: phalavat - useful.&lt;/strong> Thus for PM siddha bodhaka vakyani are not pramanams for PM because they don&amp;rsquo;t fulfill the 3rd condition (utility). This idea based on a jaimini sutra: AmnAyasya (vedah) kriyArthatvad (statements of injunctions being important) Anarthakyam (invalid) atadarthAnAm (siddha bhodkAnam).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-28--14844">Class 28 / 14844&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Brahman is the subject matter of Vedanta. Anybody against this view is &amp;ldquo;purva pakshi&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the siddha bodhaka vakyani give us knowledge of facts. Purva pakshi: Any knowledge of facts does not give me any benefit - kevala jnanam nishprayojanam. Knowing that there is a ritual will not get me anywhere, the performance of the ritual will take me anywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purva pakshi: pramanam is a pramanam only when it reveals something useful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What benefit do I get by knowing brahman is satyam jnanam anantam? That the five elements where created? That there are panca koshas in me? &lt;strong>Purva pakshi: vedosharah vedanta - it is like a barren land in a country. Entire veda (karma khanda and upasana khanda) is a greenery.&lt;/strong> usharah - desert.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purva pakshi: all siddha bodhaka vakyani are termed artha vada (eulogy -&amp;gt; useless)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We accept God as the revealer of Vedas whereas PM does not. For PM Vedah enjoys the status of God. How came Veda? It is anadi. Therefore he accepts it as pramanam. For him siddha bodhaka part of Vedah has become apramanam. If you are accepting whole vedah as pramanam, how can you reject a part of it as apramanam? PM&amp;rsquo;s answer: they are directly not useful. All the siddha bodhaka vakyams will help in the implementation of karya bodhaka vakyams:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vayu devata is a great devata because he does everything quickly - siddha bodhaka vakyam (sheshi). One should do the ritual offering oblations to the vayu devata - karya bodhaka vakyam (sheshi).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shesha-sheshi sambadhah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore any vedantic statement will be independently useless, we should link it to karya bodhaka vakyam. Therefore vedanta should be put into practice - applied vedanta (PMs idea).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM: there is no such thing called brahman at all, it is only a bhrama. Therefore according to PM brahma nasti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upanishad very clearly says brahman is not attainable nor knowable&lt;/strong> - adreshyam (not perceivable, not known), agrAhyam (cannot be grasped). PM: therefore brahman is not directly a purusharta because it is not attainable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can I use Brahman as instrument? No, brahman is avyavaharyam - not available for any TX. It is neither means nor end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since I&amp;rsquo;m already known, why should veda reveal something that is already evident? Whenever atma is talked about in vedanta, you should take it as encouraging statement. Glorification of yajamana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Up to here the two PM mattams agree.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baastha matam: all the jnana khandam vakyams should be connected to karma khanda ritual vakyams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prabhakarah: there are so many siddha vakyas and so many karya vakyas. You cannot just connect any. Any siddha vakyam should be connected to the nearest karya vakyam. In the jnanakandha itself there are many upasana vakyams. Upasana are also karya bodhaka vakyams - manasa karma. Thus rather connect the siddha vakyams of the jnanakandha to upasana vakyams existing within jnana kandha itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore &amp;ldquo;aham brahman asmi&amp;rdquo; you have to repeat all over, practice as auto-suggestion, conditioning - as upasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-29--14845">Class 29 / 14845&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>PM: brahman is nonexistent because it is utterly useless. It is neither a goal nor a means. All Vedanta vakyams are siddha bodhaka vakyams, statement of facts with no benefit, and are to be converted into karya bodhaka vakyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM: After studying Vedanta one feels very nice, one feels light. With that light mood one should do karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM: Aham brahma asmi is not a fact because brahman does not exist. Upasana is defined as seeing something upon something else. Final result: no use in jnanam, you have to do something. Either you have to do karma or upasana, action is the result of the Vedah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: what you say is perfectly valid, but there are many exceptions to the rule. Normally we find that knowledge does not give me any benefit. Yogaasana knowledge will not give me any benefit, I should implement that knowledge. Yet there are several cases where kevala jnanam gives benefit:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wherever there is a problem caused by ignorance in that case mere knowledge alone can solve the problem&lt;/strong>. Yatra yatra ajnanat dukham va karyam va bhavati tatra tatra janat prayojanam bhavati.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore siddha bodhaka vakyams produce knowledge which will give purusharta often. Where they don&amp;rsquo;t give prayojanam, in all such cases you have to join them karya bodhaka vakyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All Vedanta vakyams come under this exceptional case.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta itself makes it very clear. &lt;strong>jnana matrena moksha bhavati.&lt;/strong> Example Isavasya: yasmin sarvani bhutami atmaiva-bhud vijanatah, tatra ko mohah kah shoka ekatva-manu-pasyatah - when, to the knower, all beings have become one in his own self, how shall he feel deluded thereafter? What grief can there be to him who sees oneness everywhere? Chandogya: tarati shokam atmavid.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM: after studying vedanta we have to use that knowledge to perform action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedanta jnanam cannot be connected to karma/upasana khanda.&lt;/strong> Previous point: need not be connected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedanta jnanam eliminates duality which is the basis for karma and upasana.&lt;/strong> All vaidika karmas require two basic qualifications: aham karta and varna ashrama status (king, brahmana, etc.) and duality. Vedanta negates these, so how can it be combined with karma and upasana?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedanta positively condemns karma and upasana as bandha hetuh.&lt;/strong> After vedanta jnanam a person will lose purushartatva buddhi in karma/upasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If brahman is neither sadhyam nor sadhanam,&lt;/strong> it means brahman is something different from your goal and your means. &lt;strong>It is the very sadhaka. By negating the sadhyam/sadhanam status the upanishad says you the sadhaka are brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>John: In my family, there are three persons. One is my wife, another is my child. Who is the third one? PM: Father? John: I&amp;rsquo;m the third one! PM: OK, this is important. PM repeats the same question to Shankara. Shankara: you are the third person. PM: no, it is John!&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya: &lt;strong>Atma is well known as jivatma but not clearly understood as paramatma. Thus Vedah has to reveal atma as paramatma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-30--14846">Class 30 / 14846&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Karma sambandha is not required, not intended, not possible. Three reasons:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Vedanta is capable of giving the benefit by itself. Knowledge gives us the benefit even without connecting to any action. Sruti very clearly says the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If Vedanta expects us to do some karma for usefulness of jnanam, Vedanta would glorify karma. But throughout Vedanta karma is criticised and condemned. There is no intention of karma sambandha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta negates all the conditions for karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM: brahman is non-existent as it is neither means nor end. Vedantin: No doubt, neither means nor end - it is the sadhaka - you / I myself. &lt;strong>To say &amp;ldquo;brahman is nonexistent&amp;rdquo; is to say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m nonexistent&amp;rdquo; which is a contradiction because I have to be existent to say it.&lt;/strong> Nobody can negate the existence brahman because it is the very negator itself. &lt;strong>Not only that he&amp;rsquo;s existent he&amp;rsquo;s useful also, because when I know I&amp;rsquo;m brahman that brahmajnanam negates my jivatvam status.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM: if brahman is self-evident why should Vedanta come and comment on what is already evident to me? Pramanam is meant to reveal something not known. Vedantin: even though atma is evident, it is not fully known - misunderstood as jivaatma. I know my sat chit rupam, I don&amp;rsquo;t know ananda svarupam. Vedanta is not required to give samanya (normal) jnanam, is is required to give vishesha (special) jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantin: final offensive argument. It is the other way around. &lt;strong>In fact, karma kandam is apramanam&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does it reveal something new? Punyam, papam, svarga loka &amp;hellip; yes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is it saprayojanam? Yes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is it not negated by any other pramanam? &lt;strong>Karma kandham is negated by jnana kandam.&lt;/strong> There is no plurality at all. &lt;strong>What you call plurality is nothing but brahman&lt;/strong>. ajnana kale dvaitam, jnana kale advaitam. &lt;strong>Karma kandha reveals invalid duality, which obtains at the time of ignorance, therefore it is apramanam.&lt;/strong> Thus jnana kandha is flower, karma kandha is thread and has to be associated with jnanakandam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a means to come to jnana kandham karma kandham is useful. Sadhana catustaya sampatti pradhanena.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedantin: karma kandha is not meant for dharma artha kama purusharta. We don&amp;rsquo;t consider them as purushartas at all. They are only exalted samsara.&lt;/strong> Example: A-class prison. We only tempt other people by saying it is purusharta. &lt;strong>Karma kandha incl. upasana kandha is only to get vairagyam.&lt;/strong> Having got enough kicks in life one will get vairagyam. &lt;strong>Sugarcoating for the very bitter vairagyam pill.&lt;/strong> The idea is go there, get whipped left and right so you feel like running away. If you do, it has worked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore the first sutra is atah. Vairagya siddhi anantaram, atah brahma jijnasa. Mundaka: pariksya lokan karmacitan &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Everything other than moksha is maha-samsara.&lt;/strong> If you don&amp;rsquo;t have vairagyam, tablet dosage is not enough. Therefore increase the dosage of karma kandha and continue the medicine. Brhadaranyaka 4 - 4 - 22: entire karma kandha is to get interest in Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Interest in Vedanta is directly proportionate to vayragyam towards samsara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnana kandha is impossible without karma kandha, karma kandha is incomplete without jnana kandha.&lt;/strong> Ritualist will easily understand Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttikara matam is very close to PM. Vrttih - small commentary, like notes. Vrttikara - commentator. Vrttikara matam - the philosophy of one of the brahmasutra commentators. Shankara was not first commentator of BS.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-31--14847">Class 31 / 14847&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Word &amp;ldquo;tu&amp;rdquo; - negation of all purva pakshas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttihkara (real name is unknown) differs from PM by saying that brahman is existent. He says, brahman is revealed by the upanishad. Yet he joins PM and says that mere brahma jnanam cannot give moksha. He says that after gaining brahma jnana one has to do brahma upasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: after learning we have to meditate upon that Brahman and through constant meditation we acquire enormous punyam and as a result of this one will attain moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every word indicating jnanam has the meaning of upasanam also. The word Vedah has got two meanings. One is jnanam, another is upasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantin: exception - problem of ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: wherever the word jnanam comes, you&amp;rsquo;ve to translate as upasanam. Don&amp;rsquo;t take brahmajnanam under the category of exception, it comes under the regular rule kevala jnanena prajoyanam nasti. Look at all the vedantins who are academics but not muktas. From all these experiences it is very clear that brahmajnanam does not transform. Srutabrahmanah yatha purvam samsaritva darshat - samsara continues in those people who have learned Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, if brahmajnanam gives moksha upanishad should stop with shrotavyah and mantavyah. Yet we find that upanishad clearly prescribes niddidhiasanam (repeated dhyanam) thereafter. And what is repeated dhyanam other than upasanam?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sanskrit grammar: tavya suffix indicates a compulsory action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gaudapada: &lt;strong>every upasaka is an unfortunate one&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re not criticising upasana totally. We&amp;rsquo;re criticising upasana presented as a means of moksa, which comes after brahma jnanam. Yet we glorify upasanam before brahma jnanam as a means of mental refinement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ashariratahi moksah - &lt;strong>moksha is freedom from sharira sambandah&lt;/strong>. Samsara is sashariratahi samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as sharira sambadah is there, sukha dukha opposites cannot be avoided.&lt;/strong> Even when priyam comes, we will not be very happy, because we have to worry that the priyam will go away. &lt;strong>When apriyam comes, we&amp;rsquo;re worried. When priyam comes we&amp;rsquo;re worried about drsthi&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upasana - manasa karma. Where ever action is there, there will be tAratamyam - gradation. Qualitative and quantitative difference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Punya can only give different types of body depending on the type of punya. &lt;strong>Punya can only improve your sashariratvam, it can never make you asharira.&lt;/strong> It can give exalted or inferior shariram. &lt;strong>Therefore any amount of karma and upasana will keep you only in sashariratvam, where gradation, priya/apriya cannot be avoided. Four things are synonymous: karma, punyam, sashariratvam and samsarah&lt;/strong>. If you define moksha as upasana phalam then moksha will also involve punyam, sashariratvam -&amp;gt; will be within samsara only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>na tu karmana na tu upasanena jnana matrena moskah&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: why can&amp;rsquo;t you say ashariratvam comes because of brahma upasana? Shankara: no.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-32--14848">Class 32 / 14848&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: other upasanas will give you better sashariratvam, brahma upasana will give you ashariratvam. Shankara: &lt;strong>ashariratvam cannot be the result of any karma / upasana. ashariratvam is the very nature of atma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nature: whatever is the nature of a thing is always there.&lt;/strong> Whatever is intrinsic in a thing is always there. If heat is the nature of fire fire is eternally hot. &lt;strong>Any karma/upasana phalam is not available now but only later after the practice.&lt;/strong> Karmaphalam = sadhyam = something to be acquired in future. Asharita = nithya siddham. How can they be equated? &lt;strong>Ashariratvam is not a goal to be accomplished but a fact to be recognised.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kAjam - shariram.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purva pakshi: if advaitin defines ashariratvam as moksha he can never have jivanmukti because in jivanmukti he is sasharira.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: jivanmukti is possible when we say moksha is ashariratvam. Jivanmukta is asharira. If others think he&amp;rsquo;s sasharira, it is others&amp;rsquo; problem, not his.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no time when atma is sashariram. It is ashariram all the time:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is the very nature of myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmanah asangatvat. It cannot have any relationship with anything. Akashavat - like &lt;strong>space, which is along with every object but not connected to any.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmanah nitya akartrtvat. Sharira sambandah comes because of karmaphala. Karmaphala comes for a karta. Atma is nitya akarta.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma cannot become sasharirah, but it is mistaken as sasharirah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnani never claims the pleasures and pains as his.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2nd definition of moksha: brahma bavah hi mokshah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From scriptures we come to know &lt;strong>there is only one nitya vastu - brahman. Moksha is nityah, brahman is nityah.&lt;/strong> There is only one nitya thing -&amp;gt; mokshah prapti = brahman prapti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any karma or upasana can produce only four types of karmaphalam:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Apti - reaching (travel). Impossible for brahman: sarvagatatvA. All-pervasiveness and travel are contradiction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>utpatih - production. Brahman is nitya -&amp;gt; no question of production.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vikara - change, conversion, modification. Can jivatma gradually modify into brahman? Brahman is not the end product of a process because brahmanah avikaryatvat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samskarah - purification. Brahmanah nitya suddhatvAt - there is no question of removal of impurities (shuddha - pure, absolute).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-33--14849">Class 33 / 14849&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If moksah is the result of any action, it will certainly have a beginning. Because any result has a beginning, because the result is accomplished by following a sadhana. And whatever has a beginning will certainly have an end. Therefore upasana phala rupa moksha will be anitya moksah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All philosophers commonly agree that moksah has to be nitya.&lt;/strong> The very purpose of moksha shastra is to go out of samsara represented by mortality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chandogya 8 - 2 - 1: whatever is acquired through karma is destroyed here, whatever is acquired through punya in the other loka, that is also anitya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nitya moksha upasana phalam bhavitum na arhati. Upasana phalasya anityatvat. &lt;strong>Phalam - phalgutaya lIyate - that which becomes rotten and gets destroyed in time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upasana cannot be the theme of Vedanta. Analysis of shad lingani proved that &lt;strong>Vedanta talks about owning up a moksha which is here and now. Vedanta doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk about accomplishing something new in future.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahavakya &amp;ldquo;tat tvam asi&amp;rdquo; clearly shows by using present tense that moksha is here and now. If it is not here and now, it can never be anywhere at any time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brhadaranyaka: by putra get manushya loka again, by karma get pitru loka (svargA), by upasana get deva loka. Sanyasi doesn&amp;rsquo;t want neither. He seeks moksha. Having renounced upasana phalam and going in search of moksha, moksha cannot commander upasana phalam. Therefore vedanta doesn&amp;rsquo;t deal with karma phalam, does not deal with upasana phalam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: All the karmas and upasanas should be analyzed in the veda purva or veda anta? All karmas and upasanas should be analyzed in the veda purva, because both produce dharma or punyam and therefore everything connected with dharma should be analysed in the purva bhaga. If vedanta deals also with upasana it should be part of purva bhaga, not a separate shastram.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedanta has nothing to do with dharma. Vedata deals with an atma which is anyatra dharmAt, anyatra adharmAt, anyatra asmAt krtAkrtAt.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahma upasana itself is not possible. &lt;strong>Brahma is not available for upasana. Upanishad clearly says you yourself is brahman, which means brahman is not an object at all. It is the very nature of the upasaka.&lt;/strong> How can the upasaka brahman become upasya brahman? &lt;strong>Subject can never be the object. Subject is eternally the subject. Object is eternally the object. They cannot be interchanged.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is illogical to talk of upasana of brahman. Student asks for brahman, the teacher very clearly says: &lt;strong>whatever you meditate upon is not brahman&lt;/strong> (Kena 1 - 4, 7).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: if brahma upasanam is not possible because brahman is not an object then brahma jnanam is also not possible because it would make brahman an object of knowledge. Thus sastram cannot be pramanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: yes, &lt;strong>brahma jnanam is not possible. In fact brahma jnanam is not required.&lt;/strong> In the form of consciousness brahman is all the time evident. Nothing need reveal consciousness because consciousness reveals everything else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So why to go to guru if I&amp;rsquo;m is self-evident? &lt;strong>Our problem is not knowing brahman or atman, our problem is the misconception of atman which requires a correction.&lt;/strong> The self-evident I is mistaken.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two things are evident when I say I: I the self-evident consciousness and then the body mind complex evident because of the consciousness. When two things are shining very intimately, the properties of the body I&amp;rsquo;m throwing upon the consciousnesses out of sheer ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sastram is required not to reveal brahman, it is required to remove the superimposed limitations. This is in the form of a vrtti (thought) in the mind: aham brahma asmi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dropping the limitations is an intellectual process which is called atmajnanam&lt;/strong>. I&amp;rsquo;m not seeing, experiencing anything new, &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m only dropping something. I&amp;rsquo;m not acquiring anything now.&lt;/strong> Such an atmajnanam can come only through sastram, therefore sastram is pramanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-34--14850">Class 34 / 14850&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: jnanam should be followed by action to be useful. Shankara: Nisheda (dont&amp;rsquo;s) vakyams are as valid vidhi (do&amp;rsquo;s) vakyam. What action is involved in nisheda vakyams?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: if brahma jnanam gives moksha, all students should be mukti purushas. But when we ask them, they always start with &amp;ldquo;but, if, &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. Therefore sravanam is important, but thereafter upasana has to be done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: &lt;strong>I never says a listener of Vedanta will be free. We say &amp;ldquo;a knower of Vedanta is definitively free&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> One who has understood Vedanta:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m free: eternal fact vs. information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birthless, ashariri, ajaha vs. upanishad saying I&amp;rsquo;m birthless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Point blank answers vs. doubt. If I know I&amp;rsquo;m atma and atma is always free where is the question of doubt?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listeners are many, knowers are few. &lt;strong>Knower is one for whom &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m free&amp;rdquo; is a fact. Listener is one for whom &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m free&amp;rdquo; is information contained in the upanishad.&lt;/strong> Samsaris can be listeners but they cannot be knowers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnanam and bandha (samsara) never go together&lt;/strong>. Therefore after jnanam no upasana is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PM: Why should Vedanta presribe niddidhiasanam after study?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: &lt;strong>sravana, manana, niddidhiasanam are not practiced after jnanam. They are practiced for jnanam.&lt;/strong> Sravanam is the main sadhana which gives jnanam. As long as there are obstacles obstructing the jnanam for giving moksha, jnanam won&amp;rsquo;t do its job. Obstacle 1) doubt to jnanam giving moksha phalam 2) viparita bhavana - habitual notion that atma is something else inside me and I&amp;rsquo;m somebody else. Saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m brahman&amp;rdquo; and complaining about problems at anatma level.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Saprathibandhaka jnanam is as &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; as ajnanam. It is not ajnanam, but as bad as ajnanam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mananam removes the doubt. Nididhyasanam removes the habitual notion.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doubt-free knowledge means four things:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>what is right I should know as right&lt;/li>
&lt;li>what is wrong I should know as wrong&lt;/li>
&lt;li>why right is right (logically establish that)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>why wrong is wrong&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Respecting a person is one thing. It is the duty of a gentleman. Accepting everything is the sign of a confused man.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nididhyasanam: Changing the thought-process. Reorientation of the way of thinking. Nididhyasanam does not give jnanam, does not give moksha, it removes the obstacle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Light can remove the darkness all the time. If there are obstacles, you&amp;rsquo;ve to remove them as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After knowledge what should you do? Nothing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-35--14851">Class 35 / 14851&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nididhyasanam is not an upasanam after jnanam. Nididhyasanam is also part of the process of jnanam only.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For Vrttikara upasana is a karma that comes after jnanam. Whereas in Vedanta niddidhyasanam is not a karma after jnanam, it is also a process of jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upasana being karma produces punyam. Nididhyasanam doesn&amp;rsquo;t produce punyam, which is adrstham, it only removes our habbitual dehatma buddhi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In upasana (in vrttikara matam) one expects moksha to happen in future. In Vedanta nididhyasanam is knocking of the expectation of moksha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sravanam, mananam, nididhyasanam all put together give knowledge. Sravanam has a positive role of producing knowledge, mananam has negative role of removing doubt. Nididhyasa have negative role of removing samsaric habits.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma belongs to veda purva. In jnana kanda there is no question of karma. Upasana comes under mental karma only. Vedanta sastra only gives jnanam, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an iota of karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vrttikara: isn&amp;rsquo;t jnanam also only a type of karma? It is in the form of mental vrtti just like upasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: jnanam does not come under karma. Upasana comes under karma. &lt;strong>Jnanam depends on the object of knowledge, vastu tantram. Karma depends on the subject of action, it is kartr tantram.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The moment you become hearer, what you hear is not under your control. It depends on the object of hearer. Vrtti depends on what the speaker says. The moment you become a writer what you write depends on the subject.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnanam is dependent on the type of pramanam you use. It is pramana tantram. Whereas karma, esp. sastric karma, is dependent codana tantram karma. As a pramata what type of world I should experience will depend upon the type of pramanam that I operate. Whereas karma is codana tantram. The sastra will determine the type of karma/upasana I do. Chandogya panca agni vidya: I choose to see female and male as agni. When I see man as man is it because of sastra vidhi? It is not codana tantram. Seeing man as fire is codana tantram. Seeing man as man is knowledge, seeing man as fire is upasana. Seeing stone as vishnu is upasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma can produce four types of result: reaching, production, modification or purification. Whereas &lt;strong>jnanam does not produce any one of the four results. It only reveals a thing as it is.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you come back after one month. You get the knowledge of dirty room. Knowledge will never purify the room. Jnanam cannot do any kind of purification, if you want to purify the mind - you need to do karma. Self-knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t produce anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnanam doesn&amp;rsquo;t produce moksha, does not modify, purify nor reach anything. Jnanam reveals a fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve been always free.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before jnanam karma and upasana are required. They are not useful during nor after jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technical format sutra no. 4:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>viSayah: vedanta sastram&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vizayah: whether it is karma param or brahma param. Whether is it with some action to be done or just revealing brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>siddhanta: vedanta sastram brahma param. &lt;strong>Vedanta doesn&amp;rsquo;t enjoin any action, it wants you to understand something.&lt;/strong> It is just a matter of recognition, clear understanding. If you have purification and concentration &lt;strong>once you come to Vedanta you have nothing to do, you have something to know.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sangatih: akshepa (objection) sangatih - 4th adhikaranam is an answers to the objection given for the 3rd adhikaranam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="snl-01---introduction">Snl-01 = Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Work which deals with Siva-bhakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Devotion is nothing but love devoted to something higher, nobler, sacred. E.g. lord, guru, parents, desha (janma bhumi). Love towards a child is called vAtsalya (affection).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have got three stages from the standpoint of devata:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ekarupa bhakti. When the Lord is presented as a person, devotee can have a relationship. Good for maturity. Every person requires a trustworthy, reliable, stable and permanent relationship. Emotion dominated personality - thinking won&amp;rsquo;t be there. Dvaita approach - I&amp;rsquo;m away from the Lord physically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visvarupa/virat/anekarupa bhakti. As maturity comes, the intellect also begins to take part in the process of devotion. Lord is no more a finite person. If you attribute a form to Lord, he&amp;rsquo;ll be limited. Lord should include all the forms. In this stage I will never stand away from Lord, because Lord includes my form also. &lt;strong>No more spacial division.&lt;/strong> Vishistadvaita approach.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arupa bhakti. Lord as the universe is immature concept. As it is subject to arrival during sristi and departure during pralayam. And subject to modification and a mixture of pleasure and pain etc. Thus Lord has to be beyond time also - absolute form. &lt;strong>No more time-wise division.&lt;/strong> Shantam sivam advaitam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three stages from the standpoint of motive:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Person, whose job is &lt;strong>fulfilling my desires.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m willing to have a contract with lord. &lt;strong>Clean commercial, conditional bhakti.&lt;/strong> Lord as a means for accomplishing worldly ends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the understanding matures, Isvara is no more a means to me. &lt;strong>Lord becomes a himself a goal. I want security, peace, fulfillment all of which are possible only from limitlessness.&lt;/strong> Even brahmaloka falls under the net of Yamadharmaraja. Dayananda: &lt;strong>when the one end is missed, the ends are endless.&lt;/strong> It has to be one because limitless has to be one. Every other goals (ends) will be only temporary goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord is neither the means nor the end. If he&amp;rsquo;s the means it means he&amp;rsquo;s different from me. Same for the end. As long as Lord is seen as means or end, there is bheda. Lord is myself, which need not be accomplished in time.. &lt;strong>I understand the lord as myself.&lt;/strong> Upanishad: &lt;strong>As long as a person looks at Lord as different from himself, he&amp;rsquo;s like an animal&lt;/strong>, whose job is giving offerings to some devata.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three divisions of bhakti from the standpoint of sadhana that it brings out of me:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>karma. Actions, rituals, service. For the devotee Lord is more real than any other person. &lt;strong>Initially we&amp;rsquo;re all embodiments of laziness. Tamoguna will be only broken by rituals. Rituals are best way of burning intellectual and physical cholesterol.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>upasana. Even the most sacred action will make the mind extroverted. &lt;strong>The bigger the ritual the more restless will be the mind. One has to turn the bahirmukha mind into antarmukha.&lt;/strong> Mental instead of physical activity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jnana. &lt;strong>Mind is ready to enquire, to study the scriptures.&lt;/strong> Vedantavicara - sravana, manana, niddidhiasanam. Highest form of bhakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Sivananda lahari Shankaracarya deals with eka- and anekarupa bhakti of Siva. Lord is looked here upon as the end to be accomplished, advaitam is not given.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="snl-02---1--and--2">Snl-02 = 1 and 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Commandments of Lord - dharma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Being an advaiti does not mean losing dvaita bhakti. Advaita bhakti is not opposed, does not replace dvaita bhakti. Dvaita bhakti is an ornamentation to advaita bhakti. Dvaitam is a cause of delusion and samsara only before advaita jnanam. After advaita when consciously come down to dvaita bhakti it seems even more beautiful than advaitam.&lt;/strong> Like watching a movie knowing it is a movie. Dvaita and advaita are like two channels you can change at will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lahari - taranga (wave); a torrential, fast flowing, powerful stream&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shivananda - the ananda I get through the worship of Lord Shiva; auspicious happiness - sattvic ananda out of isvara sambandha&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When ananda arises out of worldly contact that ananda is limited because the objects are limited. Therefore the ananda is enjoyable in the beginning but when it withdraws, the withdrawal symptoms from vishaya ananda is terrible.&lt;/strong> Therefore amangala anandah. Isvara is nitya and that&amp;rsquo;s why isvara sambandha ananda is mangalam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the ahamkara I&amp;rsquo;m full of limitations. Since from vyavaharika drsti I&amp;rsquo;m an individual &lt;strong>I need the grace of the Lord for every work I undertake. That&amp;rsquo;s why even in advaita class we start with seeking the grace of Lord.&lt;/strong> Therefore Shankaracarya starts with namaskara and asks to share Shivananda with Shiva bhaktas and asks for big audience for his work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord Shiva&amp;rsquo;s dance is called tandavah, Lord Parvati dance is called lasyam. Both of them are great in fine art and in all forms of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord with the moon on the head - for him time is an ornament. He&amp;rsquo;s not beautified by the candrakala, it is the candrakala that is beautified because of the association with the Lord, as Lord is infinitely beautiful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shiva tells - because of tapas and punya I&amp;rsquo;ve got a wonderful wife like you. Parvati tells the same. Both are happily married. Both of them are because of the mutual punyam of the other. They are responsible for prakatanam (manifestation) of other peoples&amp;rsquo; karma phala.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Consciousness represents Shiva. Parvati represents thought.&lt;/strong> Every jnanam that arises in our minds is a combination of both. Shiva and Parvati appear in our hearts and shine for the devotee in the form of infinite ananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sloka 2: &amp;ldquo;may the sattvic shivananda reign supreme in my mind&amp;rdquo;. My my dry mind be soaked in the syrup of shivananda like a Rasagula.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shambhuhu - generator of mangalam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Istadevata bhakti is generated only by one method. By listening to the stories of the lord and to the stories of the devotees.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kathA -story.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="snl-03---2-6--and--9">Snl-03 = 2, 6 and 9&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>shivaanda lahari - artificial stream of shivananda tapped by Shankaracarya from the natural river of always flowing shiva vibhuties, from stories of shiva avatara. Connection to our mind through this work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This stream of shivananda destroys all the papam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mind has always the capacity to take the form of, or the character of, an object which it thinks of. &lt;strong>As a person thinks so he becomes.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s why dushsanga will make the mind dustha and satsanga will make it sat. Lord is embodiment of all the virtues so when my mind is listening to the kathas of the Lord it is attuned to these and in due course I also attain these virtues - called sympathetic vibration in physics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Satsanga method is a method in which I need not do anything unknowingly I adopt the character of the one I&amp;rsquo;m associated with.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The thoughts themselves are the pipelines which carry the shivananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The flowing stream of shivananda thoughts serves as cooling agent for the torment of samsara. &lt;strong>Sorrow of samsara - moving from one problem to another, because the power of freewill is too small in front of the power of prarabdha. Each generates some heat which accumulates.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every time I listen, In the heart bed, which is none other than my mind, the stream of water get stored.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hrada - lake&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhuvi - bed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What memory and when comes is not under control. The activation of vasanas is not under our control. How to tackle? Keep good vasanas in the mind. So even when I&amp;rsquo;m not in my senses, when I blabber, is only shiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Memory = subconscious mind = deep heart.&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appayya_Dikshita">One guru&lt;/a> wanted to know what is in his deep heart, so he took juice of a plant that knocked him off -&amp;gt; he started blabbering on Lord Shiva producing &lt;a href="https://templesinindiainfo.com/atmarpana-stuti-lyrics-in-english-with-meaning/">atmarpana&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The ultimate goal of a human being according to the scriptures is isvara svarupa jnanam (in religious language) - only this can give is security, peace, security. brahmajnanam in philosophical language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara is the subject matter of both, veda purva (focuses on ekarupa, anekarupa) and vedanta (arupa).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three tools/keys to open the veda box: vyakarana (padasastram), mimamsa (vakyasastram), tarka (pramanasastra).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Trap of tarka sastra: a person analyzes so many things.&lt;/strong> You can analyze a life long. Shankaracarya: what do you get out of these things? Your throat only will get tired. Therefore surrender to the lotus feet of Lord Shiva and may you get infinite happiness and peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shamanah - destroyer, name for Yama&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What we reject is unnatural. Mortality is unnatural since we resist it. That&amp;rsquo;s why we call Yama ghora shamanah. The only one who can destroy yama is kalakalah - Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmasutra: tarkasastra is least needed for vedanta jnanam. If we use logic it is to logically prove the redundancy of logic.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya: how long will you be obsessed with material offerings to the Lord? &lt;strong>Your mind, individuality, ego must be surrendered to the Lord. That is one flower, one lotus - the lotus heart/mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Critique of mechanical worship. The problem is when we do, the person drops even that. No worship &amp;lt; mechanical worship &amp;lt; committed worship.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="snl-04---9-12-22--and--27">Snl-04 = 9, 12, 22 and 27&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Anything you regularly do it becomes a mechanical exercise. Thus one has to remember that physical offerings are only symbolic. Through these we only want to offer one flower - the lotus of the mind. It is offered only once. Thus &lt;strong>collect the pieces of your mind that has been shared with near and dear and offer it as a whole to the Lord.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once the mind is offered to the Lord there is no more problems.&lt;/strong> All relationships but this are struck with expectations. &lt;strong>Lord does not have any expectations on us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lord makes the note - this person has already offered the one available mind to me. &lt;strong>If we mean it, offering of the mind is only done once.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human mind has two roles to play. Karta and bhokta. In each my individuality is expressed. Thus surrendering the mind is the surrender of karta and bhokta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dharma represents God&amp;rsquo;s will or God&amp;rsquo;s teaching. As a karta I have two options. &lt;strong>I can live my life in keeping with dharma which is the alignment of my individuality, my individual will with the will of Lord. This is surrender.&lt;/strong> This will be difficult because my personal raga dvesha will always challenge and suggest what is convenient and profitable. If I go by raga dvesha I&amp;rsquo;m away from the Lord.
w* Second occasion where my individuality becomes prominent is as a bhokta. &lt;strong>As a bhotka when I receive a result I judge the phala according to my expectations.&lt;/strong> There is resistance, irritation, frustration, anger for the resutl, directed towards the Lord. &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Why me!?!&amp;rdquo; psychology. Thus I should willingly accept any phala of the Lord looking at is as something I deserve.&lt;/strong> &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Oh Lord, you can never be unjust. I might not be able to know why I have this difficulty, but even without me knowing the cause, without a cause I cannot receive this result&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>Therefore I never question the justice, the compassion, the fairness of the Lord.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is resistance, mind is disturbed. When there is acceptance, there is samatvam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Thus surrender is leading a life in keeping with dharma and accepting all the experiences without resistance - karmayoga.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Place of our living doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It can never determine spiritual progress. Way of life (brahmacarya, grhasta, vanaprasta, sanyasi) has nothing to do with that. What matters is the type of attitude you have.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The fish lives in pure water still it consumes the dirt that falls inside.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fixing the mind at the feet of the Lord is called yogah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even when the conscious mind is caught up in vyavahara the subconscious mind should not lose sight of the ultimate.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Artha kama are instinctive purushartas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Interestingly the sense of insecurity increases with possessions because I have to protect not only myself, but the possessions. &lt;strong>(In)security is a feeling, it has nothing to do with external possessions.&lt;/strong> But we have a moha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kama is exactly the same. A person can never fulfill the desires and be complete.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pralobhanam - temptation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life requires artha and kama. Even a sanyasi needs food, clothes and shelther. We look upon money as lakshmi devi, not a daemon. But whole life cannot be spend on artha and kama alone. There should be ample time for dharma and moksha. Even when you spend 60y in artha kama, you&amp;rsquo;d come.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mayI krpam kuru - show mercy upon me. And take charge of this terrible mind.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Gift exchange is a common practice. Upon exploration I find that the only thing you don&amp;rsquo;t have Lord, is this mind. Please take it from me.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Biggest problem of any person is handling the mind. Just like a vehicle, as long as it runs, it is very good. ashantasya manah bharah - mind is the greatest problem of a person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have shanti. And there is no escape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Often what we don&amp;rsquo;t want we want to gift to other people. Justification: I give what the other person doesn&amp;rsquo;t have. Gift is not supposed to be handed back.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>svarbhuja - svarga bhumau jatah - parijata vrkshah - celestial tree.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Advaitam: where there is gradation jealousy is bound to come.&lt;/strong> Jealousy leads to inferiority or superiority complex.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If an actor constantly plays female roles after some time outside also his walking, talking etc. will become feminine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Differences between gods are only in the beginning level of ekarupabhakti. Immaturity is the cause of all fights between bhaktas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If God is incapable of doing one thing than it is rejecting me.&lt;/strong> He&amp;rsquo;s everywhere. We always want to belong to someone. Whether I belong to other people or not I always belong to Lord.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Important advaita verse: Lord please provide me with a proper guru. If there is none around, please you yourself do teach.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Never study the scriptures independently.&lt;/strong> One needs somebody who knows the correct meaning of the scriptures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I can never choose the guru.&lt;/strong> To know if he understands the scriptures I would need to understand the scriptures&amp;hellip; It should click and if it should click &lt;strong>I require the grace of the Lord.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devas are also samsaris. But their jail is first class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Final stage of spiritual sadhana is consistent, systematic teaching for a length of time under the guidance of a competent teacher. You can postpone it, but cannot escape.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Mind - receptacle for the knowledge. Balance of mind - shama, tranquility of the mind is only possible when values are there. Without values, a person cannot get an appropriate mind and without an appropriate mind knowledge cannot be received. Even it is received it cannot be retained and even if it is retained, it cannot be absorbed. Like oil on top of the water. There will be a gap between my life and what I know - I will be a hypocrite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedanta is relatively easier. A little bit sharp intellect is enough to understand. The bigger problem is tackling the mind.&lt;/strong> Vedantic benefit I&amp;rsquo;m seeking is at the emotional level.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vasana based emotions are one thing, ignorance based emotions are something else. There are many emotional experiences from the past very well stored in the mind. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what comes when. These cannot be handled just by mere understanding. I know I should not react like that but I find it just happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Through this prayer he&amp;rsquo;s inviting the Lord to come and handle these unhealthy, unpredictable often responses or thoughts. Shankaracarya&amp;rsquo;s carrot: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Oh Lord, you&amp;rsquo;re a great hunter. The first hunter. You need not go anywhere. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a dense dark forest here - it is my mind - with countless wild animals. Inexhaustible. Pitch a tent and stay permanently. We both get what we want&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> If mind has to be handled, mere individual effort is not enough, grace of the Lord is also required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kirAta - hunter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>moha (delusion, wrong ideas) like taking security from outside, taking fullness from outside.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>What fear do I have? What anxiety do I have? I have a lion (lord Shiva) behind me to move around in the forest of the world.&lt;/strong> &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Let the whole world go away from me. That no human being can blackmail me. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve got the greatest support behind&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lion requires, occupies a cave. Lord Shiva needs a cave too - the mind. In all the upanishads &lt;strong>mind is compared to a cave.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mukha - face, mouth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>mRgadhara - Shiva holding a deer in one hand. Deer is symbolic of the restless mind of the devotee&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>zArdUla - tiger. Lord Shiva destroyed vyagrasura. Also an elephant demon, therefore he&amp;rsquo;s also gajasurasamhara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sign of real devotion is fearlessness.&lt;/strong> As long as we have fear, our devotion is verbal, fake devotion. A frightened devotee is a like a square round.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>bhakti is defined as that, in which devotees mind is spontaneously fixed upon the Lord&lt;/strong> - the mind naturally gravitates towards the Lord. First it is practiced deliberately, then it becomes natural. Lord is not seen as the means for the world but the world is seen as the means for the end, the Lord. Finally Lord is discovered as I myself the absolute I which is behind all the transaction then the love for the Lord will become equal to love for myself. &lt;strong>The greatest love for everyone is self-love.&lt;/strong> Example: like a river flows naturally towards its real origin, home the ocean.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>sakama bhakti requires the observations of all the rules and regulations. In nishkama bhakti, where it is meant for the purification of the mind and attainment of Isvara and knowledge, even violations of the rules don&amp;rsquo;t matter. Not that we should willingly violate, but if they happen, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When bhakti is intense, rules become secondary.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m a stone hearted fellow and I&amp;rsquo;m asking you Lord to come and occupy my heart. And I know you&amp;rsquo;re a great dancer (nataraja). Therefore you&amp;rsquo;ve to regularly practice dance. If you come to my heart, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a hard time. My heart being very tough, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a lot of pain in your feet. In your biography I found you enjoy dancing on rocky mountains. Then I understood the purpose is you want to come and dance in my heart. What other reason could you have to choose rugged rock if you have so wonderful places to dance. Therefore &lt;strong>I have all the hope even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have the qualifications&lt;/strong> that you will come down and bless me.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>In the 7th year of blood, Achilles the god amongst man, was slain. Our hope was lost. Troy had taken the best of us and still remained locked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mighty Priam, give me life and I&amp;rsquo;ll be your slave.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You see, you gods of sea and sky. I conquered Troy. Me, Odysseus! A mortal man of flesh and blood and bone and mind. I do not need you now. I can anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was my serpent who silenced Lacoon, or your horse was doomed. Yet you refuse to give thanks. You will suffer for this offence. You suffer for this offence. For your arrogance, you will drift on my sea for eternity. Never again you&amp;rsquo;ll reach the shores of Ithaca. You will suffer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No one will stop me from seeing Ithaca.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He&amp;rsquo;s just a boy. He&amp;rsquo;s not ready for man&amp;rsquo;s work. A: Because you will not let him grow. P: It is my son, not yours. A: My son was ready for all things. P: Yes, your son had his father.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You must live for your son. You must raise a king.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The wine. We&amp;rsquo;ll trade it for water.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m the youngest, Polyphemes. What did you bring?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take me next. Of course, if you do, you&amp;rsquo;ll eat all your magic inside my head.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My name is nobody.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your hear Poseidon? Odysseus is alive and you cannot stop me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>O: Why are you helping me? A: because you&amp;rsquo;re the first mortal ever to use his mind. And you understand that there is always something to learn!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Polites: I don&amp;rsquo;t care. I want my share.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You betrayed me. You fools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She offered food and wine in her honeyed voice. The witch waved her hands and each one of our brothers was turned into an animal before our eyes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Careful, you&amp;rsquo;re about to lose your sword and you need it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Please cake care of my sword. H: I&amp;rsquo;m not allowed to touch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot refuse a goddess. Only then she will surrender your men.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The only way I will turn your soldier into man is if you take me into bed. Brave Odysseus. Are you still a man?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But it is mine. If I&amp;rsquo;m old enough to keep my father&amp;rsquo;s flocks and kill his game, then I am old enough to use his bow. P: If you can string it. If you cannot, you&amp;rsquo;ll place it into your father&amp;rsquo;s treasury until I give it to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>P-&amp;gt;A: You&amp;rsquo;re my mother. You&amp;rsquo;re my father. You&amp;rsquo;re my strength.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve given me much Circe, but no bare enough flesh could make me forget Penelope.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>O: No! You, open your eyes and you see who I am!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you still wish to go home, you must first enter the underworld. Only there you will find the answers you seek.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You must cross a river of fire and sacrifice a ram. And you must enter the fire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And what of my son? He&amp;rsquo;d be 15 by now and still without his father.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mother, men are in the hall. They say they&amp;rsquo;re here for you. Men who say my father is dead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I will receive these men and that is all. They will have nothing that belongs to Odysseus. Not his fortunes, and not his wife.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The river of fire. Let me come with you. O: No. I must cross it myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>P: Your soul will burn away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is I, am lost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stay back, this ram is not for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>T (blind prophet): You&amp;rsquo;re a clever man, Odysseus of Ithaca, but not a very wise one. You keep your eyes only on your home. Blinded, you do not see that it is the journey itself that makes up your life. Only when you understand this you will understand the meaning of wisdom. O: No, the wisdom, I will find alone. Help me find my way! T: &lt;strong>The answer has been before your eyes, every night at sea.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A (in the underworld): You must hurry. Men are trying to steal your world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Men would stop at nothing to steal my kingdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I hope my father died a hero. If he&amp;rsquo;s alive, he&amp;rsquo;s forgotten me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The day the gods gave you to us, they took your father from me. But he promised me, with you lying here in my arms, that he would return alive, as this tree around which we built our world, is alive. T: If he&amp;rsquo;s alive, why hasn&amp;rsquo;t he come? P: I know your father. He&amp;rsquo;s alive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guests leave when asked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alone, my men lost before my eyes. I float endlessly in Poseidon&amp;rsquo;s sea. Wondering when he&amp;rsquo;ll take my life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>C: It is only a dream. O: No, it is real. My men, my brothers, they&amp;rsquo;re all lost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Telemachus! What are you doing here in the dark (trying to string Odysseus&amp;rsquo; bow)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m mentor. Keeper of the staff.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give me a ship. I will sail from Ithaca and find my father.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From a wild boar. I was 15. And my mother cried tears of happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t you see? No one leaves my island. And all that lives here exist to serve me&amp;hellip; Forget Ithaca. You&amp;rsquo;re home now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not worry. The gods are watching you with favour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember. The gods will not do for man, what man must do for himself. You must make this journey.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For two more years, Calypso&amp;rsquo;s island was my prison. Forgotten by the outside world, abandoned by Athena. My hopes of reaching the Penelope began to fade.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I saw you on the day you were born. It was the proudest and most painful day of your father&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You Telemachus must return and fight for what is his, and yours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My goal is not to kill you. You must understand. That without gods, man is nothing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I was alive. Broken by Poseidon&amp;rsquo;s waves.&lt;/strong> But I was alive. I was led to the palace of their ruler, the powerful king, Alcinous.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I understood that I was only one man in the world. Nothing more and nothing less.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pontonous. Blend a sleeping potion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My cheese. My wine. My bread.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am alive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Please, look at me. Do you see yourself In my face.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I know what your head asks your heart. You&amp;rsquo;re afraid your Penelope has been untrue to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He went for his father and found a filthy beggar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I did not find him. But I know my father is alive.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He&amp;rsquo;s alive. He&amp;rsquo;s alive Odysseus. He knows your sorrow. Your pain. And he longs to touch your hand, hold you in his eyes, kiss your lips. He&amp;rsquo;ll come to defend you. He&amp;rsquo;ll come to defend you. You&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;ll take my world back.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I cannot do it, no man alive can. O: And what about a man who was dead?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your crime is that you tried to steal my world. The world I built with my hands and my sweat. The world I shared with a woman who bore me my son and no one will ever that that from me! Now you&amp;rsquo;ll die to a man in a river of blood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I will never leave you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s 20 years since you held me in your eyes. O: That was only one day. P: And in one day you&amp;rsquo;ve seen all the world? O: Yes. So much that is sacred and beautiful, but nothing as beautiful as a man&amp;rsquo;s own world. That he can take in his hands and always be his. You are my world.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dms-01---introduction">DMS-01 = Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dakshinamurti as an aspect of Lord Shiva as brahmavidya guru. Same as Hayagriva in vaishnava sampradaya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another name for Lord Shiva as Dakshinamurti is Sadashiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shiva is the laya karta, one who resolves the universe, the dvaita prapanca. That destruction is relative, not ultimate destruction, because during pralaya the duality goes only to unmanifested condition. Duality and samsara very much remain. &lt;strong>Ajnanam is not destroyed when pralaya takes place. Ajnanam destruction job, destroying dvaita permanently, is done by Lord Shiva as Dakshinamurti.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dakshinamurti (or anybody for that matter) destroys ignorance by providing knowledge. &lt;strong>Jnana dvara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is only one method for transmitting knowledge: vrtirupajnanam into shabdarupajnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sadhana catustaya sampati itself is only a training in converting the upadesha vakyam into brahma vidya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stotram = glorification. Acknowledge of our gratitude.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Word &amp;ldquo;dakshinamurti&amp;rdquo; has two meanings. murti = vigrahah, form, personality; dakshina (indeclinable) - facing southern direction; daskhina (declinable) - compensation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every direction has got deity assigned. East - Indra, south - Yama, west - Varuna, north - Soma. Yama represents one who controls everything including the population. Yama means mortality. Mortality means finitude. Finitude means bhayam, lack (dissatisfaction, desire). A finite person is always a wanting person. Therefore &lt;strong>Yama is equal to samsara. Dakshinamurti is the only one who is not afraid of facing south, not under the grip of Yama, not limited by but has conquered time&lt;/strong> (dakshinA-mUrti: meaning 1). Therefore he&amp;rsquo;s also called mrtyumjayah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dakshinamurti tells: &amp;ldquo;everyone who wants to conquer mortality, come to me&amp;rdquo;. E.g. story of Markandeya muni, who wrote candrashekara (means also mrtyunjayah) stotram, is about one who keeps moon as ornament. Moon represents time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meaning 2 (dakshina amUrti): &lt;strong>dakshina - expert, skilled person, samartha. Expert in communication, expert in everything. amUrti - the one who is really formless one, ni-rupah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worship requires altar. You&amp;rsquo;ve to offer flowers somewhere. Formless deity cannot be worshipped. Therefore for the sake of worship there is a version. In its nature Dakshinamurti is formless, nirgnuna brahma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We start with brahmavidya guru Dakshinamurti (saguna) and we end with nirguna brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya assumes that the student of Dakshinamurti stotram has studied upanishads reasonably well. This is a deep vedantic &amp;ldquo;PHD-level&amp;rdquo; text, not just plain glorification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Method of communication of brahmavidya is like for any other subject. Consistently, systematically for a length of time. Gradual buildup of knowledge. It&amp;rsquo;s just holier. Not a flashy experience that comes in a moment of meditation, but understanding that is built-up in our mind. Like any regular teaching: at regular intervals clarification of doubts, then next level of teaching, then next set of doubts &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prakatita para brahma tattvam. One who has given a brilliant exposition. &lt;strong>prakatanam - revelation.&lt;/strong> Revelation - knowing the unknown, of the reality which is infinite brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vyakyanam - exposition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Silence can be interpreted in any way. Therefore maunam here it not to be taken in literal sense. here: maunavyaka - indirect description. &lt;strong>Description is possible only in terms of attributes&lt;/strong>. Attributeless cannot be described directly, only by implication.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dms-02---dhyana-sloka---1">DMS-02 = Dhyana Sloka - 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ide - namas karomi (I offer namaskara)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any attribute is considered a limitation because any particular attribute excludes the opposite attribute.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman is an &lt;strong>existent thing which is different from all objects of experience.&lt;/strong> That is the experiencer, the observer, subject.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Neti-neti: Brahman is &lt;strong>what remains after the negation of everything. If the negator has to be negated you require another negator.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maunavyakyanena: upanishad doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about brahman so we can say upanishad is silent about brahman. At the same time it communicates what needs to be communicated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dakshinamurti is always pictured as young physically (meaning 1). Figuratively &lt;strong>youth stands for positive approach to anything. Freedom from cynicism, pessimism&lt;/strong>, which is general tendency that overcomes us when we grow old. We generally speak about the &amp;ldquo;good old days&amp;rdquo;. That &lt;strong>&lt;em>in our times everything was good, values where there and now are going&lt;/em>. Generally old age makes us pessimistic, cynical, critical. If you are able to avoid negativism, cynicism, criticism &amp;hellip; then you&amp;rsquo;re youth in your mind. Vedanta makes a person youthful in the mind (meaning 2). Always positive, appreciative, non-critical &amp;hellip; in any field.&lt;/strong> Vedanta makes you positive, makes you see the good things that are happening. Dakshinamurti&amp;rsquo;s mind is soaked in vedantic perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(meaning 3) Youthful spiritually: yuva means the one who is free from apakshaya. Ever youthful never aging. Not affected by kalatattvam. Like Markandeya who is supposed to be ever 16.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avrtam - ever surrounded by.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rshi - one who is a good thinker, informed, mature person. A viveki - one who knows ephimericality of everything. One who does not expect security from insecure, perishable things of the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vayragyam is required because only then vedanta will become priority. &lt;strong>Without viveka and vayragyam vedanta will not appeal. Even if it will, it will be a hobby, timepass, only. If vedanta should become my life&amp;rsquo;s mission, perhaps the only mission, it requires tremendous viveka and vayragyam&lt;/strong> and that is indicated by &amp;ldquo;rshi&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Committed seekers have left everything else and they have surrender to this guru. They don&amp;rsquo;t have any other agenda/program.&lt;/strong> Therefore they are antevasat (resident student in a guru kulam) rshigana, so they learn by non-verbal communication as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children learn more from parents through non-verbal communication than through verbal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>varsistha - very old (disciples). Generally three ashramas are required for ripening of a person. &lt;strong>You cannot enforce interest of vedanta. If at all we have to force, dharmasastra we have to emphasize&lt;/strong>. We allow people to grow into vedanta. Generally it takes years and decades.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmanistha - 1) jnani 2) those who are interested in becoming brahmanista. Who&amp;rsquo;s only agenda, deep interest, obsession is only in that. 3) &lt;strong>Deeply religious person established in commited to their istha devata. Established in saguna brahma coming to learn about nirguna brahma. In the name of philosophy they do not reject religion.&lt;/strong> Tradition says Vedanta goes always with religion, internal and external also. &lt;strong>Without bhakti jnanam will not shine.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The one who lives the teaching is brahmanistham. One who lives the teaching and does not teach is called kevala brahmanistha. One who lives the teaching and teaches is called shrotriya brahmanistha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dakshinamurti is the only acharya who never was a disciple. Adi guru. The second guru was not born wise, etc. Dakshinamurti is also called acharyaindra (-indra suffix means shrestha - the greatest one). Sampradaya (method of communication) initiator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>mudra&lt;/strong> - gesture, gesticulation, &lt;strong>a form of non-verbal communication&lt;/strong> (dance, painting, body-language, sculpture &amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cinmudra (cit-mudra) - jivatma paramatma bhodaka mudra. Index finger - ego, jiva. Thumb - size of free space in heart. Paramatma and/or flame is to be meditated upon as having size of a thumb. Other three fingers - sharira trayam. Index finger naturally &amp;ldquo;joins&amp;rdquo; the other three, not the thumb.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the four fingers are useful for us because of the thumb. &lt;strong>Thumb has got independent existence, other four fingers dependent existence. In sanskrit all the four fingers have feminine gender indicating prakrti. Thumb only has got masculine gender indicating purusha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Index finger cannot join paramatma without renouncing the other three (sharira abhimanam). You can never have both.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the index finger is away from the thumb it is mortal. When it joins the thumb making a circle&lt;/strong> - it has become &amp;ldquo;asatoma sat gamaya, mrtyor ma amrtam gamaya&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mere mudra cannot teach. &lt;strong>Cinmudra can communicate only if somebody explains the cinmudra.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One can derive ananda from guru status - another form emotional of dependence (samsara). &lt;strong>Dakshinamurti doesn&amp;rsquo;t derives ananda from anything, any being, any relationship. His ananda comes from himself (svatmaramam). If there are shishyas, he enjoys guru status (daksinamurti). If there are no shishyas he enjoys atma status (kevala - non dual - shiva).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Face is the index/mirror of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dms-03---dhyana-slokas--2-to-5">DMS-03 = Dhyana Slokas- 2 to 5&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>nishannam - seated&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vata - banayan, vitapi - tree. Fig tree (ficus benghalensis). Uniqueness of one type of the tree is that no birds will sit on the tree.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhumibhage - on the ground, at the foot of vatavrksha&lt;/li>
&lt;li>muni - thinking, mature people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jnana dataram - one who imparts jnana vidya&lt;/li>
&lt;li>arat - (meaning 1) one who gives the knowledge straight away at the time of teaching itself, &lt;strong>one who is capable of direct and instant communication, his communication never allows the students to objectify brahman&lt;/strong> but makes clear that he&amp;rsquo;s talking about the student himself which is evident here and now. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about your eternally available brahmanhood which is not a status to be acquired in future. Therefore there is nothing for postponement but for claiming up at the time of teaching itself; (meaning 2) &lt;strong>one who can give knowledge even from a distance&lt;/strong>. Because being the Lord he can bless even from distance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tribhuvana guru isham - omnipotent, powerful teacher, preceptor of all the three lokas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>guru is from root grnati - to teach. Or gu - darkness, ru - eliminator. Eliminator of darkness is light. Inner darkness is ignorance and inner light is knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Communication is the toughest task. It is very difficult to get a mind which is ready to listen for a length of time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>daksha - samartha. That Dakshinamurti who is capable of destroying the word with the sword of knowledge, which cuts the tree of samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>After gaining knowledge I continue to worship as a gesture of gratitude.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>citram - vicitram, something wonderful, abnormal, extraordinary. Generally teacher is elder and students are younger. Here it is the opposite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>old one an be by knowledge, experience or regular age. Here &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; represents maturity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Primary indication of the internal youth is a mind which is always optimistic and positively thinking. When dream are replaced by regrets it is an indication of our entering into old age.&lt;/strong> Vedantin is always yuva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cinnam (root: chid) - destroyed, free from&lt;/li>
&lt;li>niddih - abode, repository, treasure house&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Basic auxiliary sciences required for vedanta: &lt;strong>language&lt;/strong>: pada sastram (grammar). &lt;strong>logic&lt;/strong>: tarka shastra - proper thinking, pramana sastram (logic), &lt;strong>scriptural interpretation&lt;/strong> vaykya sastram or &lt;strong>nimamsa sastram, which is the special skill in interpreting the vedas.&lt;/strong> As there is many seemingly contradictory statements in the vedas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acharya who is skilled in all three basic sciences required for learning and communicating Vedanta is called pada vakya pramana paravarinah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhishak - doctor, vaidyah. Dakshinamurti is the greatest doctor. Specialised in the disease of samsara caused by the virus called ajnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhavah - janma. Bhava roga - disease called birth. Birth includes death. Therefore punarapi jananam punarapi maranam is called bhava roga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Primary impurity is ajnanam, next level is ahamkara, next level is punya papa karma, next is sukha dukha phalam. All the malams like manitvam, himsa, kama, krodha, lobha, moha &amp;hellip; are integrally connected to ahamkara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nirmalaya - one who is pure. Therefore prasantaya - tranquil, relaxed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dms-04---dhyana-slokas--5-and-6">DMS-04 = Dhyana Slokas- 5 and 6&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>pranavartaya - the one who is the meaning of the word pranavah (om). Dakshinamurti is said to be the meaning of the word pranavah both in saguna and nirguna svarupam. Pranavah has two part, one is the sound part (om) and the other is silence which is at the beginning and at the end. Sound corresponds to saguna and silence to nirguna Dakshinamurti. Silence part is called amatra. See mandukya upanishad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rudram</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-01-18-rudram/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2021-01-18-rudram/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.yogaliving.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Rudram-a-spiritual-translation-final110218.pdf">Summary&lt;/a>&lt;br>
&lt;a href="https://arshavidyacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Sri-Rudram-Text-Anuvakam-1-11-devanagari-transliteration-translation.pdf">SA/EN anuvAka 1 - 11&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="class-1httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcqlul3qkiyk-2021-01-16">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLul3QKIyk">Class 1&lt;/a> (2021-01-16)&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Primary aspect of Rg Veda is upasana. Mental worship. In Yajur Veda focus is karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Veda is divided into samhita (collection of mantras, hymns) and brahmana, which is dos and donts, rituals. Brahmana is subdivided into 1) brahmana 2) aranjaka 3) last portion is upanishad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re all devotes of supreme will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rshih - the one who sees the truth. In Vedic times the vedic seers worshiped the same supreme will in the form of natural forces. Antarjami - inner controller, that&amp;rsquo;s the Isvara which Vedic hymns worship. We&amp;rsquo;re worshiping Isvara as multiple extracosmic persons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For rshis the worship is born out of the wonder, glory of Isvara in the cosmos. For most devotees today wonder, glory of god, is replaces by desires and fears.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rshis looked at water as manifest form of God. How nicely it promotes and sustains life. It is so abundant. Name is vArunah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bhakti is wonder, not sentimentality. When you wonder, there is no me and mine. Sentimentality mostly is about me and mine.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever the rishi looks at the fire there is a wonder. It is the most powerful manifestation of universal power called God. Therefore fire became primary alter of worship for Vedic rshis. They worshiped wind, space which is grafity, sun, moon, stars, prthivi as mother, trees, plants. All their worship are born form the sense of wonder in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chandogya upanishad, Brhadaranyika upanishad, beginning of Yajur Veda give an idea about Rudra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upanishads are not continuation of karma and upasana. They are revolution of them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human life are divided into three savanas (section). First 24y pratah savana. All our troubles are taken care of by parents. Next 48y up to 72y we&amp;rsquo;re independent people. We need some kind of propitiation -&amp;gt; Chandogya advises to worship Rudras.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Indriyas are called Rudras because they make us cry. And they themselves cry. Rudanti, rodayanti. &lt;strong>Rudra is malevolent aspect of supreme will&lt;/strong>. You cannot have only good aspect in the creation. Best example for Rudra nowadays is Covid.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re always praying to the supreme will. Now you call it (address the aspect) Rudra, later something else, it is still one supreme will.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t react to anger (of the other). Act. First do namaskara to anger. Prostrate if not welcome. Attitude like &amp;ldquo;Oh, Covid devata, my prostrations to you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anybody carrying a weapon is Rudra. Don&amp;rsquo;t look at him as villain, criminal. Rudra has taken him over at the moment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A mantra having a specific meter, i.e. a verse, is called Rg Matra. Prose mantra, meaning it has no specific meter, is yajuh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Everything happens because of the higher power (Isvara). This recognition is called bhakti.&lt;/strong> Scientists say the same thing with a different terminology. A small thing is the way it is because the entire universe is the way it is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Name of the unfavorable expression of the supreme will is Rudra.&lt;/strong> Rudra is the one who strikes, presented as a personification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Verses are pointing towards seeing Rudra as virus/bacterial infection. They are asking not to be subjected to these as favour from Rudra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reason for putting a temple on the summit of a mountain. 1) Beauty 2) to reach the summit of a mountain you have to leave worldly life behind. You&amp;rsquo;re one with nature, with beauty. 3) It also requires earnestness in the heart. It requires effort, tapas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In artificial beauty, jiva expresses. In natural beauty, Shiva expresses.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Giri is megha, rain bearing cloud. Agriculture depends on rains. Rain is considered blessing from above. &lt;strong>The one who abides in that giri as the most pious life giving water is Shiva, called &amp;ldquo;girishanta&amp;rdquo;. Or the one who abides in (behind) the sacred words of upanishads.&lt;/strong> Puranic meaning - god abiding in the mountain of Kailash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Giritra&amp;rdquo; one who abides in the rain bearing cloud or in the words of upanishads and protects as.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Agrarian society means &amp;ldquo;purusham (people) jagat (living beings moving around)&amp;rdquo;. In modern times for city dwellers it&amp;rsquo;s only about purusham. Veda mantras begin with cattle, because for agrarian people cattle is their life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generally people don&amp;rsquo;t pray to gain God. This prayer is to gain Rudra, using the most auspicious words - shivena vacasa. &lt;strong>Prayer or no, whatever you say must be Shiva. Why speak inauspicious, harsh words at all?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you work under a boss you want a favourable disposition of your boss. Here authors are asking Rudra to think of them favourably.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>These prayers say &amp;ldquo;naha&amp;rdquo; (us, all of us - family, community, cattle), not &amp;ldquo;mama&amp;rdquo; (mine)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If Covid-19 is Rudra&amp;rsquo;s weapon then the vaccine is Rudra&amp;rsquo;s blessing only. Both are his blessings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="class-3httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvt01jezjswki-2021-01-30">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t01jezJsWkI">Class 3&lt;/a> (2021-01-30)&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prayer: may the Isvara (Rudra) think nice about us and say nice things about us. May he bless us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blessing can be in the form of thought or speech. Generally it is thought of as speech.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pratamah - foremost. Who was there as the time of creation. The cosmic person. Hiranyagarbha. That is Rudra only.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Who am I?&amp;rdquo; Better question is &amp;ldquo;What am I&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students of Vedanta should pay attention to the word &amp;ldquo;deva&amp;rdquo;. Isvarah cinmayavapuhuh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhiSak - physician&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Innocence is divinity.&lt;/strong> You find it with village folk (India), side by side which ignorance, which has no value. The innocent people look at the physician as a god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dhanvantari - physician of the gods&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should not say english medicine, telugu medicine. &lt;strong>Knowledge has no boundaries&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The faith you have into the doctor helps you to get out of the illness, recover quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In fact you surrender to the physician. Illness cured by the physician is limited to the body. But there is &lt;strong>psychological illness - seeking more. The sense of more.&lt;/strong> We&amp;rsquo;ve countless desires and then fears. &lt;strong>This kind of illness is treated by surrendering to the higher power called Izvara&lt;/strong>. Immediate disease: sukhaduka cycle. Long range: birth and death cycle. Only Izvara (supreme will/prime mover) can treat that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Agrarian society. Everywhere there are serpents. Serpent is in the psyche of vedic people. Serpent is anything which crawls. A crawling creature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two kinds of evil spirits: rakshasa - cruel, violent, they carry a weapon on their body. asura - people given unbridled pleasure-seeking 24/7. They are evil people because everything is looked at through pleasure seeking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weather has big impact on psyche. The way a person speaks and acts you can figure out the weather in which he was born and brought up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sun worshipers worship sun excluding everything else. We worship Isvara (in the form of sun) including everything else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In India midday sun is very harsh, so it is the morning and evening sun that is worshipped.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there is no thought, inner silence, spaciousness - there are no boundaries. When you abide in that, that itself is considered supreme worship of Isvara.&lt;/strong> If you want to make it saguna you can visualise in your heart the prime mover - upasana. If you want to come down further and need an image, look at the rising sun.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedic rishis did not worship God in man-made images. They worshipped god in god-made images.&lt;/strong> Waters, sun, candra, prthivi &amp;hellip; They did not have the need to build a brick-and-mortar temple and install a image to worship God. To such an extend they looked at the rising sun as the supreme alter of God that they never missed a rising sun. They made it a rule.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>asau - &amp;ldquo;rising sun&amp;rdquo; in vedic sanskrit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tAmrah (copper-brown) -&amp;gt; arunah (ochre, reddish) -&amp;gt; babhru (white). In the heart of a vedic seer there cannot be anything more auspicious than that. They have a very special bond to the sun, which they feel in the heart. Seeing Sun as the most glorious aspect of the higher power.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to worship? Say it with feeling, mechanical mumbling words has no value. And now you&amp;rsquo;re in direct communion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Newtonian physics the distance between the eyes and the sun is millions of miles. In Einsteinian physics the distance is zero.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You can see your position in the cosmic game of Isvara when you are praying to the rising sun&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h1 id="class-1-introduction">Class 1: Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>niddhhai - deep meditation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An informed seeker rejects moksha, artha, kama and goes for the only permanent goal - moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is permanent (nityam) must be available in all three periods in time. If it is available in present, it must be already accomplished (siddhah). &lt;strong>Moksha is always already accomplished fact - it can never be a goal to be accomplished in the future&lt;/strong> (sadhyah). Sadhyah moksha is a logical contradiction, an unholy combination.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sadhya mokshaha never exists, siddhah mokshah always exist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta starts with thinking. We are working for clear understanding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross-ventilation: entering through one ear and existing through the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guru might compromise and give some (compromised) sadhya mokshah to the student. Like giving something to do for the children to keep them busy. This is the two-step moksha called 1. jivan-mukti and 2. videha-mukti.&lt;/strong> Escapist future moksha provided by shastra itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adhyaropa - anything provided provisionally meant for the consumption of the junior student. Should be withdrawn later by a serious student.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thus a Vedanta course through sravanam (prasthana trayam), mananam, niddidhiasanam is served. To get the cream of Vedanta through sravanam: &lt;em>brahma satyam, jagan mithya, jivo brahmaiva na parahah&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Information I cannot apply unless I&amp;rsquo;m convinced. Therefore mananam becomes important. Brahmasutra is primary a mananam granta (nayya prasthanam). Bhagavad Gita is called smrti prasthanam. Upanishads are called shruti prasthanam. If I have too many question I will have to go through nyaya prasthanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mental preoccupation indicates which anatma is occupying our mind - attachment to what.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Until the student can say &lt;em>aham brahmaiva na paraha&lt;/em> the sravanam, mananam should continue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m the superwaker the consciousness principle and I have two shaktis. With my mayashakti I create vyavaharika dream called jagratprapancha. With nidrashakti I project the pratibhatika dream called svapna prapancha. I project both, I lend existence to both and I make them appear real. But they are mithya. I cannot be located in time and space because they themselves are maya/nidra projection.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation cannot produce any knowledge, neither worldly nor spiritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the convinced student is niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Candidate: student keeping sadhya moksha package in mind. He got the message loud and clear and is convinced he&amp;rsquo;s the candidate for niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose: internalising this message. To get it in the subconsciousness mind so that even in dream or any provoking situation I remember that I&amp;rsquo;m brahman. &lt;strong>I don&amp;rsquo;t learn new things in niddidhiasanam, I repeat for internalisation. Anatma that is disturbing us: body, mind, family, possessions, profession should be also brought to the scene and jaganmithya should be clearly registered. Atma being asangaha is incapable of relationship. Satyam can never have relationship with mithya.&lt;/strong> Reducing jivabhava and increasing brahmabhava - emotional reactions will come down.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Apavada - removal of what has been introduced (like bandage or scaffolding). Now as a senior student I have to drop the idea of sadhya moksha. Moksha is not a goal. It is my intrinsic nature. &lt;strong>If somebody comes and ask &amp;ldquo;are you jivanmutka&amp;rdquo; I will only smile.&lt;/strong> Jivanmukta is initially an inspiring word but can cause vedantic samsara later. Foget jivanmukti and videhamukti and replace by nithyamukti. &lt;strong>Aham nityamukti asmi. And in me the drama is going on.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-2-verse-1">Class 2: Verse 1&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Candidate: Primarily senior students. For senior students &lt;em>aham brahma asmi&lt;/em> is a fact, for junior students an imagination. Vidyaranya says go imagine - junior students can perform niddidhiasanam as well. If one can&amp;rsquo;t imagine, even recitation of the niddidhiasanam-shlokas will work and spiritually elevate a person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose 1). &lt;strong>Jnana nistha: internalization, so that I naturally confront all the situations in live as brahman not as jiva.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose 2) &lt;strong>reduction of me/mine misconceptions. FIR reduction.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose 3) &lt;strong>vedantic samsara: moksha (as a) goal misconception must go away.&lt;/strong> Moksha goal is presented to a junior student, before mahavakya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Post mahavakyam every student should go to the guru and declare how he looks upon himself now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Object: of meditation is not thoughtlessness but content of the three shlokas: braha satyam jiva mithya jivobrahmaiva na paraha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Method: the only condition is that the mind should be totally occupied with the threefold conclusion. No other rules. Then you are in niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If one is too busy with vyavahara it is better though to have regular times, proper &lt;strong>slow breathing (breathing and thoughts are interconnected)&lt;/strong>, proper asanam, pratyahara (withdrawing mind and sense organs from panca-anatma), meditation-friendly place. And then dharana, undistributed absorption in vedantic thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only when a thought is entertained deliberately for a time it will go into subconsciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Progress is measured by getting by checking if one gets closer to the purposes. CLASP rejection. I&amp;rsquo;m ready for anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Learn to claim all Brahman&amp;rsquo;s glories as yours. I&amp;rsquo;m not a miserable jiva. That should be wiped out from our subconscious life. It is a vesham, dream, drama. I&amp;rsquo;m a super-waker.&lt;/strong> Replace the word Brahman by the word I.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m nithya mutkam brahma. I will never look forward to moksha. That is injustice to mahavakyam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sacred thread - voluntary bondage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jati - birth, niti - commandments, kula - family, gotra - tribe, lineage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dUragam - far away from this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>namarupa - world of names and forms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>guna - virtues&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dosha - flaws&lt;/li>
&lt;li>varjitam - excluded, avoided, without&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hinduism: marriage is based not on compatibility but on karma yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-3-verse-1---4">Class 3: Verse 1 - 4&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The entire aim of coming to Vedanta is receiving this message alone (mahavakya). Hereafter this message is going to be the anchor of my life. Basis to develop a new outward outlook, basis for relating to the world as Brahman. Triangular -&amp;gt; binary format.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In public life, in worldly life, I have to use the triangular format otherwise I&amp;rsquo;ll be sent to mental hospital. The format change has to happen in private life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It will take some time to get used to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Even the name Brahman is vyavaharika world. No names whatsoever can be applied in paramarthika&lt;/strong>. Brahman transcends name, time, space, objectiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Empirically real means unreal.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have existence apart of Brahman. Saying &amp;ldquo;unreal&amp;rdquo; would disturb so we use &amp;ldquo;empirically real&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If names and forms are dismantled I cannot experience anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Mike is&amp;rdquo;. I appreciate two words: &amp;ldquo;Mikeness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Isness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vimalabodha - clear knowledge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gocaram - available for claiming in the knowledge &amp;ldquo;aham brahma asmi&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vastu - reality&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot experience that (Brahman) because you are it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Non-binding expectation of the guru: student claiming aham nitya-mutka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Urmi - huge wave&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anatma will have its own problems. Transcend anatma by panca kosha viveka and allow it to go through its lot. It is unstoppable.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No body can escape old age and death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manomaya problems: conflict -&amp;gt; worry, sorrow. &lt;strong>Conflict in the buddhi because humans want to make perfect decisions and escape failure.&lt;/strong> We have no way to knowing if the decision was good or not until the result comes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yogihrd - in the hearts of the senior vedantic students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhAvitam - meditated upon without objectification. Meditation on the meditator (= niddidhiasanam)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>buddhiavedyam - not objectificable to the intellect also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>anavadyam - nirdosham; free of all the drawbacks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This entire world is a vyavaharika dream. Now we&amp;rsquo;re not looking at it from this perspective because we&amp;rsquo;re spiritually asleep. After becoming a super-waker the only difference from waking up is that I continue to have this experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhRanti - maya&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The entire dream world does not occupy even the complete mind. In the mind infinite vasanas are there and only some vasanas get converted into dream.&lt;/strong> Dream occupies only a part of the mind and that mind is in the waker. &lt;strong>Similarly whole cosmos occupies only a part of maya and that maya belongs to brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>svAsrayam - self supported, unsupported, independent&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sadasadvilaksana - different from karyam and karanam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nishkalam - partless&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>mithya is both available for inclusion and exclusion. Just like dream or shadow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nirupama - matchless, incomparable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For paramarthika there is really no example. akasha and prakasha come closest to it. Look for similarities, not dissimilarities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-4-verse-4---7">Class 4: Verse 4 - 7&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In niddidhiasanam only conclusions are used. Steps (explanations) were covered during years of sravanam and mananam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A dreamer in dream will never accept that the dream is his projection. Here the niddidhiasanam is assuming that we have understood that this world is a dream. I&amp;rsquo;m neither the projected world nor the projected body/mind, I&amp;rsquo;m the consciousness principle behind them which is before, now, after.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t reduce the pain but it reduces the impact of the pain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedantic meditations one cannot enter without years of study.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Six modifications of the body: birth, growth, transformation that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve growth or decline, decline, degeneration, death. Consciousness is free of them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>apaksaya - declension&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vyadhi - degeneration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Degeneration is natural. Everybody would like to skip this phase. Yet &lt;strong>Vedanta doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer to cure the diseases (of old age). It offers wisdom to give us healthy attitude when the diseases come.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nashanam - death&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vihinam - free from&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avyayam - undecaying&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Isness&amp;rdquo; is not separate, yet another expression of all-pervading consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ava (avanam) - preservation, existence, protection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vighata - cessation, pralayam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because of intimate bodily sensations one makes the conclusion &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the body&amp;rdquo;. Vedanta revises this conclusion. Example: experience of sunset and sunrise vs. sun not orbiting the earth. &lt;strong>Conclusion and attitude don&amp;rsquo;t change the experience&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Matter is an appearance in the consciousness without existing on its own. By observing the matter you lend existence to it. Matter cannot be counted as second entity.&lt;/strong> Just like you cannot say clay and pot. &lt;strong>Pot is clay.&lt;/strong> There is no world other than me. It is like a dream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>aapastam - not negated(-able)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>niscalam - undisturbed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jalaraashi - ocean&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nistaranga - without waves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avibhaktamurta - indivisible nature&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vyavaharic/mithya/&lt;strong>anatma centric goals can be there&lt;/strong>. Otherwise mind and body will rest (get sick). &lt;strong>Moksha is nityamutka, it as goal is oxymoron. Jnani: as a free bird I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the hobby of having various goals for the body/mind/sense organs/family/surroundings etc.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world was there in visible or invisible form in Brahman all the time. But being appearance, it cannot be counted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to &lt;strong>escape from the world - escapist moksha.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m the adhisthanam into which the world comes, appears and dissolves.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-5-verse-7---10">Class 5: Verse 7 - 10&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Karanam status of Brahman is adhyaropa - temporary. Once brahman satyam jaganmithya is given, the student is ready for the next stage - apavada, i.e. negation of the karanam status.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then the question comes what is the world? Not a product of Brahman but an appearance in Brahman. Mithya. Of a lower order of reality. Just like a dream. Always in either manifested or unmanifested form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advaita doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother about another mithya vastu. It&amp;rsquo;s only the real that is one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Final mind boggling message - you are that reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no second other real universe other than me the real consciousness. &lt;strong>There is only unreal universe which is appearing projected.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In our common experience always the causal factor is never one. Many are involved in any creation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any theory of creation will have logical loopholes. Therefore you&amp;rsquo;d never accept a creation. World is a mysterious appearance without an beginning or an end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even if science discovers a god-particle it has nothing to do with Vedanta. That particle will be also part of creation. They can only hover about the unreal. &lt;strong>We have no means to identify the reality.&lt;/strong> Upanishads alone talk about that - consciousness. Which is not in time and space, which it pervades.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Niddidhisanam - going to the green room. Go there every once in a while. Self-knowledge demagnifies problems. Recite &lt;strong>mātrā-sparśhās tu kaunteya śhītoṣhṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ āgamāpāyino ’nityās tans-titikṣhasva bhārata&lt;/strong> and smile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nirvikalpakam - divisionless&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sankhya comes very close to Vedanta. Yet that say that every jivaatma is an all-pervading consciousness. There are so many all-pervading consciousnesses -&amp;gt; division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m always nirvikalpaka, not only in niddidhiasanam, in which I entertain thoughts regarding Brahman exclusively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>analpam - not small, not finite&lt;/li>
&lt;li>aksaram - imperishable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yatksaraksaravilaksanam - different from both manifested and unmanifested (Maya) universe; different from material principle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avyayam - inexhaustible&lt;/li>
&lt;li>namarupagunavikriya - the world is not a substance in itself, one Brahman presents itself in the form of name, form, configuration, attributes, changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you put maya-glasses the Brahman will appear as universe. If you remove maya-glasses universe will be Brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hemavat - like the gold&lt;/li>
&lt;li>svayamavirkiyam - be itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t undergo a change&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cakasti - all the time shining&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every perception proves the availability of the medium of light, even though we ignore the medium of light. We focus on what is in light forgetting the medium of light&lt;/strong>. Vedanta extends this to consciousness - the ultimate light. And (this) light doesn&amp;rsquo;t require another light to &amp;ldquo;illuminate&amp;rdquo; it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-6-verse-10---12">Class 6: Verse 10 - 12&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do niddidhiasanam until: whenever I think of me, I spontaneously think of brahman.&lt;/strong> This is brahmanishta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;There is nothing&amp;rdquo; (in the vessel). There is also known-ness. Thus there is no time when there is absence of is-ness and known-ness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>anaparam - without a karyam (product); not a karyam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>parAtparam - superior to maya; transcending maya&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is-ness of moonlight doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the moonlight. Similarly, Maya depends on Brahman for its existence. Independent existence is the superiority of Brahman. In vyavaharika both are required and respected. Brahman depends on Maya to get Iswara status in the empirical world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pratyag - the inner most principle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>eka - non dual&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rasah - without substance attribute dichotomy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmalakshanam - referred to as atma - I&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman is not 2nd person, not 3rd person, it is 1st person singular always. Aparokshajnanam: when thinking of Brahman, I think of myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Ness&amp;rdquo; limitation (table-ness; a table can&amp;rsquo;t be a chair) - vastuparichedah. Brahman is free from time, space and vastuparichedah as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In karma- and upasanayoga the most important word is Bhagavan. Niddidhisanam involves transcending religion. We respect people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to. In niddidhiasanam, in spiritually, the most important day is I. &lt;strong>Vedanta asks to start the day with aham.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dhanyo&amp;rsquo;ham - I&amp;rsquo;m the most fortunate one&lt;/li>
&lt;li>krtakrto&amp;rsquo;ham - I&amp;rsquo;ve total fulfillment (because I&amp;rsquo;ve got purnatvam)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vimukto&amp;rsquo;ham - I&amp;rsquo;m free of jIvabhava (the intellectual samsara of ahamkara and mamakara and thus of emotional samsara)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bhava - samsara&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nityAnandasvarUpo&amp;rsquo;ham - &lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m of the nature of happiness. If anybody is smiling is anywhere, I&amp;rsquo;m reflecting his his mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pUrno&amp;rsquo;ham - &lt;strong>I don&amp;rsquo;t lack anything. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to compare with my neighbour. I&amp;rsquo;m so happy for him. I&amp;rsquo;m never unhappy with myself&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tvadanugrahAt - from your grace&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Grace of guru is his teaching. As far as we are concerned, we require transformation through words. Initiation or dIksha is consistent systematic teaching.&lt;/strong> There might be extraordinary ways of transferring teaching, but they are all for jivas with extraordinary upadhis. Human beings require sravanam&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I appear a jiva for all others but in my vision I&amp;rsquo;m not a jiva. I get jivabhava because of my association with the three bodies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>anango&amp;rsquo;ham - I&amp;rsquo;m without this physical body; (= I&amp;rsquo;m with mithya physical body)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>alingo&amp;rsquo;ham - I&amp;rsquo;m without sukshma shariram&lt;/li>
&lt;li>amalo&amp;rsquo;ham - I&amp;rsquo;m without impurity; I&amp;rsquo;m without karana shariram (in this context)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>abhangurah - imperishable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sthuhla shariram perishes at the time of death, sukshma shariram at pralayam, karana shariram at videhamukti.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-7-verse-12---15">Class 7: Verse 12 - 15&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>asangoham - three bodies are mithya, as good as absent; I&amp;rsquo;ve no relationship with the physical body - I don&amp;rsquo;t call it mine. It is an essential part of the macro-anatma. Satyam cannot have relationship with mithya&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preciso Me Encontrar</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-11-07-preciso_me_encontrar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-11-07-preciso_me_encontrar/</guid><description>&lt;p>by &lt;em>Cartola&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Recently its Author has passed away and he&amp;rsquo;s offered his position including the ownership of OASIS to anybody who masters his three challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Win an unwinnable race. The key to this challenge is to drive backwards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask the Lady of the Author to dance. Easy, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Well, the Lady is trapped in the &amp;ldquo;Overlook Hotel&amp;rdquo; from the horror movie &amp;ldquo;The Shinning&amp;rdquo; (sa:deva) and she&amp;rsquo;s dancing with dead people. On the way to the Lady, one has to go through all the zombies. Lady is source of life itself, in the form of a woman. And key to it is through suffering. Hint from the 2nd challenge: &amp;ldquo;Ultimate answer will be found in the Fortress Tragic&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The final challenge takes place on the planet Doom. But this is not the challenge. It is to win an unknown game while playing it! How to do? Just like life, really. &amp;ldquo;The key is to play without going for the win. Everyone who wins loses. Keys are invisible and hidden in a dark room that&amp;rsquo;s the center of the maze. Found by wandering about until you get to the invisible dot - it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy if you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; And the name of the first game? &amp;ldquo;Adventure&amp;rdquo;. And the prize obtained is the first easter egg ever - the name of the Author of the game.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>After mastering the three challenges the winner - Parzival - is presented with a huge golden &amp;ldquo;easter egg&amp;rdquo;. And what does the winner gain? Well, the usual - the world with the princess and his new identity as the ruler of it - of course.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pancadasi - Chapter 2</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-10-12-pancadasi_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-10-12-pancadasi_2/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;h1 id="class-1-1-2">Class 1: 1, 2&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2nd chapter - Mahabhuta viveka. Between elements, elementals and Atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This world, before it was created, was sat alone. &lt;strong>sat eva somya idam agra asit ekam eva advitiyam&lt;/strong> (Chandogya).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is difficult to see the all-pervasivnes of consciousness and ananda because it gets not manifested everywhere. That&amp;rsquo;s why here sat that is obvious everywhere is discussed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Consciousness is the invariable factor in all the experiences of all the three states&lt;/strong> and therefore consciousness is sat and beyond time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consciousness is independent because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any means of knowledge to reveal itself. &lt;strong>Self-effulgent, svayam prakahsa&lt;/strong>. Sense organs &amp;ldquo;shine&amp;rdquo; because of I. Shine = reveal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chronological time - involved in the motion. Subjective time - which is created subjectively by our own mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Observer is there before and after the event.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Truth of the time = present. That present is nothing but consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sat being the cause of the creation is really all-pervasive. Space is not.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-2-345">Class 2: 3,4,5&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If by going into sleep you&amp;rsquo;d become non-existent, you&amp;rsquo;d never go to sleep.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The person in deep sleep, sanmatra (sat matra) - just are in the form of sat, pure existence. Same condition as before the creation. No time, no space, no objects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything that has come from the Brahman called sat, has only borrowed existence. Five elements, their gunas and the products therefrom. Through Maya the sat appears in all. Names and forms cannot add anything to the substance. Just like bangles and gold.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Akasha, sabda (etc.) - &lt;strong>name and form is Maya. Existence is Brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What cannot add anything is appearance&lt;/strong> (bangle to gold).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cause is what pervades. Sat pervades entire creation like gold pervades bangle. Therefore &lt;strong>by knowing sat everything will be known&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take away the form and nothing remains (name is given by humans).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Akasha is allpervasive thus shabda, its property, is allpervasive. But it is avyakta. Thus rishis had to do special tapas to extract the mantras and put them in words - manifest them. They made their mind so refined they could do it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sound gets normally manifested by two methods: sanyoga - things are brought together. Viyoga - two things are brought apart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Third method. Enclose akasha in a container and sound gets manifested as echo. E.g. talking. By talking I&amp;rsquo;m not producing sound. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing into manifestation the words which are unmanifested in space. Example: like white light has seven colors and a prism can manifest them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vayu has also sabda guna borrowed from akasha. If the wind is cold, there is water in it. If it is hot, fire. By itself it has no such attributes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sound of wind: bee-see, fire: bugu-bugu, water: bulu-bulu, earth: kada-kala.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Only water has the property of taste, unmanifested. The object helps to manifest a particular taste. Same with objects. They have no color, the light has all colors and objects absorb some and reflect others that are then seen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a black hole the gravitation is much then even light won&amp;rsquo;t reflect and gets totally absorbed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-3--6-7-8">Class 3: 6, 7, 8&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fragrance and foul smell are the two types of smell that belong to earth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taste of pure water is madurhyam - combination of all possible tastes. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean sweetness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Color of the earth - all type of colors. Borrowed from agni.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Skin pervades entire body. Outside and inside. Where skin is there is tvak-indriya. Two places where it is not: nail and hair.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sense organs have the power to sense external objects by sensing the guna of them, under the condition that they remain in the respective golakams&lt;/strong> (part of sthula shariram). That&amp;rsquo;s why when Jiva is travelling and there is no sthula sharira no perception is possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sukshma sharira travels, not reflected consciousness because it is all the time there. &lt;strong>Any reflection you cannot separate from the reflected medium.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the ears are covered, one can hear internal sounds clearly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Pancadasi - Chapter 1</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-08-02-pancadasi_1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-08-02-pancadasi_1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzPObzMRrhDzeMKLPyUBkHxqxe7pldLER">source&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="01-introduction">01: Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Like nobody can take your medicine, nobody but you can help you with moksha. Artha, kama, dharma one cat get through a proxy. Not moksha. First three can be attained by karma. Moksha only through jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything in the three periods of time but you exists conditionally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three obstacles: 1) lack of preparedness 2) obstacle pertaining to the interpretation of the sastra itself (different schools) 3) logical problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ad 1) If I give less value to the attainment of moskha, then I am deficient in qualification. The greater the spiritual hunger the greater sadhana chatustaya sampati. No worry, listening to scriptures sadhana chatustaya sampati grows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ad 3) Vedanta: What is never experience and still there is the reality and what is experienced all the time is not the reality. How come?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conviction: knowledge free from doubts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prasthana traya (basic texts): Gita (smruti), Upanishads (shruti), Brahma Sutra (yukti or nyaya).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Texts to remove interpretional and logical doubts are called Prakarana grantas. One of the popular is Pancadasi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pancadasi because 15 chapters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="02-chapter-1-1---2">02: Chapter 1: 1 - 2&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subject matter of the scriptures: jiva brahma aikyam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What I love is my nature. Existence, happiness, survival, knowledge. Independence. What I don&amp;rsquo;t love is not my nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pada comes from padayati/pAdayati - makes us reach the destination. Feet cause us to reach the destination. Shankaracharya is called Bhagavatpada.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sastra wants to make you free from the notions regarding you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Distance between me and brahman is in terms of ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahamoha - ignorance of the limitless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Being free from the hold of raga-dvesha is all that is required. You can keep them. You cannot be free from them completely.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To acquire qualification there is thousands of way. Karmayoga. Once qualified, there is one to get the knowledge. Jnanayoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnanam itself is moksha.&lt;/strong> There is no time involved between jnanam and moksha &amp;ldquo;happening&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="03-chapter-1-3---4">03: Chapter 1: 3 - 4&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tatvajnanam: jiva brahma aikyam. Essence of the teaching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plurality of external objects is proven through internal plurality of experiences. Each experience, even though is seems like one, consists of thought and consciousness. Thought appears, gets associated with consciousness and becomes perception. Both are needed for experience, like electricity and bulb for it to shine. Thus diversity of perception is due to diversity of thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waking state experiences, cognitions, are called vishesha jnanam. Consciousness common in all existent at all times is called samanya jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thoughts arrive and go. Consciousness is all the time there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In sushupti (deep sleep) two things are experienced: anandavrti (sukham - I slept well) and ajnanavrti (ignorance).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I love myself unconditionally. I love every other thing in the creation conditionally. Anything which you love conditionally is not your nature - because there is a condition.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Object of the unconditional love (myself) is a source of joy. Cit = Ananda. Unconditional means all the time there. Cit = Existence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to separate consciousness from thoughts in experiences? Through discriminative analysis. There is no question of physical separation - nothing is basically separated from consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>consciousness is not part, product nor a property of a thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>consciousness is an independent principle which pervades every thought and turns in into experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>consciousness is not limited by the boundaries of the thought. Thought is located, consciousness is not.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>consciousness continues to exist even when all thoughts resolve. Absence of the thoughts is revealed by the consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>consciousness is not available for transaction in absence of thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In waking state objects are long-lasting (due to outside objects made of pancha bhutas), in swapna objects are momentary because they are made of thoughts only.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="04-chapter-1-5-6-7">04: Chapter 1: 5, 6, 7&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There are for things in every avasta: object of perception, thought, perception, consciousness.&lt;/strong> In dream state the objects are made just of thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If perception doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, make use of inference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Perception (=experience) is made up of thought and consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If memory is there, I must have undergone an experience. Based on memory of the deep sleep state, I can say that in sushupti I experience tamaha (ignorance) or ananda. As subtle body is absent, this vrti takes place in the karana sharira.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever is unmanifested you take as absent. Whatever is unmanifested you&amp;rsquo;ll not be able to experience. Like butter in yogurt. &lt;strong>Only after you wake up (during waking state) the experience of ignorance gets realised in the form of thought.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Object of memory is identical with the object of past experience. Anubhava gives rise to smrti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every perception has name and form. Remove intellectually and what remains is the one consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Names and forms are called upadi(s).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conscious is used as adjective (depending on a substantive) in the language - corresponds to the view of the science that consciousness is attribute of the brain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Electricity needs a bulb for expression. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a bulb for existence. It&amp;rsquo;s independent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is unmanifested you&amp;rsquo;ll not be able to experience, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it is not there. Like butter in the jogurt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For expression in the form of life the consciousness needs a body and a mind. But not for its existence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything else needs consciousness to be proven, consciousness does not - it is self proven.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is self-revealing is self-existent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Existence is always proved by knowability and to know you require consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anavasta dosha - infinite regression - would happen if consciousness would need something else to prove it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t need nobody else to know that you are and that you know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If consciousness can prove itself there would be a problem. The prover and the proven must be different.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="05-chapter-1-5-6-7">05: Chapter 1: 5, 6, 7&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Thoughts are innert in nature. They need consciousness in order to be converted into experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because of mulaavidya (upadi of brahman, maya, shakti, avyaktrtam, avyaktam) alone brahman is called jiva. It is the cause and therefore not available for direct experience, only the product is experiencable. What you experience in the waking state is called tulaavidia. That&amp;rsquo;s ignorance pertaining to the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the sleep the object of the thought is tamaha (=mulaavidya).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Innert things cannot experience anything. Because you have experience in deep sleep (of ignorance and bliss) it proves consciousness is there.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shunyam (nothingness, zero) of Buddhists - total nothingness. Vedantic nothingness (mulaavidya) is infinite and is the cause of entire creation. Cause of everything in potential state.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In potential form you cannot find any differences and therefore it is called avyakrtam. All names and forms come to unmanifested and therefore it is called avyaktam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scientist are attempting to study consciousness as matter (as part, property or product), not as a distinct principle. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is not available for scientific study, which can examine only energy (abstract form) or (concrete form) of matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I use the same &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; as adult and as child even though the bodies are totally different. That proves that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; is something different from the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To say &amp;ldquo;time begins&amp;rdquo; you need already some time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Universe will be always made of five elements in every srsti. So the objects of experience will match the karmas from previous srsti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If the medium of reflection is absent you will not be able to say if light is there or not. Same for consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life has to do with prana. Life has nothing to do with consciousness. It is a product of maya and mithya. Consciousness is just present all the time. &lt;strong>Arrival of life is not arrival of consciousness but an expression of it (which requires a conducive medium of a subtly body for manifestation).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consciousness is one. Plurality belongs to the forms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is self-revealing is self-existent and requires no proof of its existence. Like sun.&lt;/strong> Like you not needing anybody to tell you whether you are in the class or not. To prove your existence you should already be existent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Light of lights. Ear of ears, eye of eyes, prana of prana &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once anything becomes becomes an objects of consciousness it becomes/is automatically inert. If a consciousness needs another consciousness to be revealed the first one becomes (is) inert.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="06-chapter-1-verse-8">06: Chapter 1 Verse 8&lt;/h1>

&lt;li>What is temporary, is not my nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Recognition is connecting of past and now/future. You need to remove the incidental features. Same for body and atma.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m the consciousness with incidental body, sense organs, mind, prana, intellect, karma&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who you are should be your understanding. For transactional purposes use the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; you had before the knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wherever there is object of love it is the source of the joy. &lt;strong>Atma is the object of love for everyone, thus it is the source of ananda. Shown in everyone taking care of himself/herself very much.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love for the self is instinctive and universal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your whole activity is centered around the care of yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suicide: his intention is not to end his life, his desire is to end the suffering. And she/he sees no hope.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma is the only source of joy.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A changing thing cannot be the intrinsic nature of a thing.&lt;/strong> What is incidental comes and goes. Heat in water vs. heat in fire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Body/mind is not intrinsic to the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. That we see in the analysis of the three states.&lt;/strong> Jiva is intrinsically satchitananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Logic means inference.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quality of love towards an object is of different quality than the love to the self. &lt;strong>Love towards an object is based on conditions. No one loves any person nor any objects nor god unconditionally. Only the love of self is unconditional. It is instinctive (we&amp;rsquo;re born with this, animals as well - manifestation: resistance slaughterhouse). It is universal.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One never want to get rid of the self, only of problems/suffering.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Conditional love is as good as no love. You don&amp;rsquo;t love the person (or object), you love the condition.&lt;/strong> Atma is the source of greatest joy as there is no condition involved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta: You should be able to arrive logically at what the shruti says. Sanhyas, Vayshyeshikas, Nayayikas give up shurti when their logical conclusions (tarka) contradict shruti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Puja Swami: Whatever has parts will fall apart. It is anitya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta: Akasha has also parts, because shruti says so. You will not be able to arrive at the nature of yourself using logic only. By yukti (reasoning) you arrive at the conclusion that jivatma is paramatma. To know that Isvara is paramatma you need shruti. So basically they are one and the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Charasteristic of samsara: attachment (ragah), sorrow (shokah), delusion (mohah). That is the suffering caused due to ignorance. Life itself becomes a kind of prison due to ignorance. That&amp;rsquo;s why Upanishads teach us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both total ignorance and total knowledge are a bliss and no problem. Partial knowledge about oneself is a problem. Example: rope-snake.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Samsara: sense of individuality&lt;/strong>, sense of limitation, sense of discomfort. See oneself as karta, bhokta, victim of prarabda, etc. Leads to hurt and guilt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Habitual looking into shining surfaces to see oneself demonstrates self-love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Daily I go and search for objects that give me happiness - that shows my ignorance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This knowledge you gain in the buddhi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Partial knowledge is a problem. Many voices in the chorus prevent the father from recognising his son&amp;rsquo;s chanting (&lt;strong>partial knowledge prevents discrimination&lt;/strong>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A wise man loves the world for the sake of the world. He loves unconditionally - knowing that everything is me. A samsari loves the world for the sake of himself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnani identifies with everyone. He sees himself everywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evident = experienced (= known).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Light is the one which enables to see the hand. But you are taking notice only of the hand - it as though covers the light, even though the light is more pervasive. &lt;strong>Experiencing the light most people miss the light, because they focus only on the hand.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The very cloud &amp;ldquo;covering&amp;rdquo; the sun is seen doe to the sun. It cannot cover the sun, yet it can cover out vision of the sun. It brings it out of your focus. Like in cinema we are so engrossed in the movie that we miss the screen and scream. (&amp;ldquo;En-grossed&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s why missing the &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mulaavidiya is called karanaavidya. Tulaavidia is called karyaavidya.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If atma is totally unknown to you, there will not be self-love. If it is totally known to you that atma alone is source of joy why should you have logging for a sense object?&lt;/strong> Attachment towards the world indicates that you are not fully aware that you are the source of joy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>An inert object is one which is incapable of revealing itself. It always needs a conscious being for that. It is not self-existent (because not self-revealing), thus it is mithya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When did ignorance join the ever-blissful atma? Anadi. This is the one answer meaning &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t ask&amp;rdquo;. If somebody asks further - we say anirvachaniya - it cannot be categorised (as sat/asat), mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishistadvaiti book: Satadushani - 100 defects of Vedanta. Vedantins say those are 100 ornaments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The only job of avidya: damage the person. It joins you in each life and creates samsara. Karta -&amp;gt; actions -&amp;gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Words are meant to reveal the objects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before creation there is Purusha (Brahman) and Prakrti (Maya). Brahman has no desire, no power, no knowledge to create. Prakrti is mithya thus cannot be counted. Example: There is me and my reflection, how many are there? Thus advaita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brahman associated with sattvapradanaprakti (=Maya) becomes nimittakaranam. Associated with tamahpradanaprakrti becomes upadanakaranam. Brahman becomes creator through association. Satya-mithya sambandha. No relationship, as relationship needs two equals.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t have any relation with anybody. Neither with the body, neither with my senses, neither with my mind. Neither with the world, neither with any person, neither with any object.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Brahman associated with rajapradanaprakrti becomes jiva.&lt;/strong> Total sattva or total ignorance - no problem. Intermediate thing - Brahman associated with avidya saying I&amp;rsquo;m jiva = samsara. &lt;strong>There are many shades of rajapradanaprakrti therefore there are many jivas.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman associated with sattvapradanaprakti becomes jnani. That&amp;rsquo;s why they tell you to increase your sattva and decrease rajas and tamas. More sattva means more knowledge, more clarity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rajoguna - action function. Sattva - knowledge function. Tamas - suppression of both action and knowledge function.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="10-chapter-1-verse-16---19-creation">10: Chapter 1 Verse 16 - 19: Creation&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prakrti doesn&amp;rsquo;t poses the three gunas. They are not its attributes. They are Prakrti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishudha sattva is Maya. With Brahman reflected in that it is called Isvara. Malina sattva is rajapradanaprakrti is avidya. Brahman reflected here is called Jivah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara is swami, Jiva a dasa. Iswara is a master of Maya, Jiva is a slave of avidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Iswara: Brahman + reflected consciousness (pratibimba) + Maya (sattvapradanaprakti) + tamahpradanaprakrti. Jiva: Brahman + avidya + reflection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vicitram = variated. Many kinds of karanashariras thus jivas are there. Jiva = pragnaha. We are prepared for creation now (creator and creature is there). Ishvara will provide another two bodies and objects to experience sukham/dukham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tamahpradanaprakrti means predominance of tamas, not exclusivity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maya is not a product of Brahman. Both are anadi. Brahman reflected in the Maya or avidya is also anadi. All (Maya, ajnanam, Iswara, Jiva) except for Brahman have an end, thus are mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Iswara is the adiguru and he initiates the brahmavidya. He&amp;rsquo;s got no ignorance. Jiva has partial knowledge (he knows only that I&amp;rsquo;m) but this leads to misconception which in turn to samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara is like the spider of Mundakaupanishad. Both nimittakaranam and upadanakaranam for the whole creation. From upadanakaranam he creates five elements &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>By the will of god (depending on jivas&amp;rsquo; karma), not by the fancy - that would mean raga and dvesha.&lt;/strong> Otherwise there would be no order (action -&amp;gt; result experiences the same one).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Srshti is cyclic, not linear. There is no beginning and no end. Moksha is going out of the srshti cycle, once the merry-go-round becomes sorry-go-round.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="11-chapter-1-verse-20---26">11: Chapter 1 Verse 20 - 26&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>One antahkarana has two names based on the function: mind and intellect. Mind decides something (=sankalpa) and then immediately a question/doubt arises (=vikalpa). Mind decides and there is no doubt against it - buddhi.&lt;/strong> Like one person is called manager and householder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intelligent creation: if you see a pot, it is intelligent creation. A conscious being must be involved - nimittakarana. Without the blessing of Isvara the creation will not be intelligent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depending on the function prana is considered fivefold.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once prarabda is exhausted and jiva (karanasharira, sukshmasharira with chitabhasa) wants to go udana shakti gets ready. All other pranas become weak so udana can &amp;ldquo;take off&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Satvaamsha of five subtle elements gives rise to antahkaranam and sense organs. Rajasamsha of the five subtle elements gives rise to prana and organs of action.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="12-chapter-1-verse-26---28">12: Chapter 1 Verse 26 - 28&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Jiva identifies with one subtle body. Ishvara as Hiranyagarbha is identified with all subtle bodies created out of the five subtle elements. He has all sense organs. All organs of action. All minds. Identified with all still he&amp;rsquo;s not a samsari.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sukshma shariram requires a sthula shriram for sukha/dukha anubhava. Without it it cannot function in the world to experience sense objects. There is no communication/TX/experience to/with jivas without a body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose for creation of jivas is experience of pleasure and pain (exhaustion of karma).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raw material for creation: sthula mahabhutas - grossified subtle elements. These can be experienced and are used to create the world (bodies and objects).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without identification with the karana shariram there cannot be identification with the subtle body. &lt;strong>Jiva = identification with karana shariram.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>From the gross elements brahmANDa (cosmig egg) is created first. Then in it the fourteen lokas. In the various lokas then a variety of sense objects and sthula sharirams. Isvara identifies with all sukshma shariras and becomes Hiranyagarbha. Then Hiranyagarbha identifies with all sthula stharirams and becomes Vaishnavara and all the gross bodies gain the status of Visva.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lok - to experience. What is experienced is called loka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vaishnavara - vishvesham naranam nayanat. Identified with all the physcal bodies. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; in his mind will mean all gross bodies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you don&amp;rsquo;t identify with the gross body, you cannot experience pleasure and pain.&lt;/strong> You cannot get pleasure through sense objects - vishayaananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishva - jiva identified with the gross body (and the two others). Jiva although expanded. Got a full manifestation (in regards to his possibilities of experience).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is punyam predominance, the taijasa gets a celestial body (deva). Devas are eternally young.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is predominance of papam, they get a tiryam shariram (animal body).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If punam papam are almost equal - deva tiryam shariram (nara, human body).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara, Hiranyagarbha, Vaisvanara &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Prajna, Taijasa, Visva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara and Prajna have a joint venture. One contributes creating power through maya, the other karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ajnana is cause of sukha/dukham and of samsara. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to Isvara, only to Jiva.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subtle elements are born from the tamahpradanaprakrti of Iswara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karana shariram means sanchita. Jiva has got a specific subtle body born of his sanchita karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Virat, Hiranyagarbha, Iswara - there is dehaabhimana. But Iswara etc. knows deha is mithya. This identification with the body is also mithya. Just like a jnani. Example: actor playing a beggar. He speaks everything as for the role. He has to identify, otherwise there will be no next role.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Iswara (Virat) is like prime minister speaking for the whole country. He identifies with all gross bodies and sense objects as well.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman identified with rajapradanaprakrti - I know myself and I don&amp;rsquo;t know myself. That is the misery. I&amp;rsquo;m bound because I consider myself a limited being. Dehaabhimana leans to sense of inadequacy -&amp;gt; desire to become adequate -&amp;gt; kartrtvama and bhoktrtvam -&amp;gt; karma -&amp;gt; punar janma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Momentary happiness proves the misery.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avidya -&amp;gt; kama -&amp;gt; karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parag darshinaha - becoming extrovert. Objects are outside so you turn outside for happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ignorance leads to extrovertedness and extrovertedness supports ignorance. It is a self-sustaining cycle.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no time for self-inquiry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma - karma phala cycle. Addiction to activity. Never becoming free, never getting peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compassion without expectation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guru upadesha - rescue mission. Systematical consistent study for a length of time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sense of discomfort for everybody - uneasiness called samsara. &lt;strong>Nobody except jnani accepts himself.&lt;/strong> You cannot accept yourself as a limited being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should never go to a guru who was never a sishya (never go to a self-taught one).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Absolute peace - videha mukti and jivan mukti. By knowledge - no other solution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the guru doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the lifting method, thi jiva will make the guru a samsari.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Annamaya - anatomical personality. Born from sthula mahabhutas - gross eements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Koshas cannot cover Brahman physically, but by distracting attention. &amp;ldquo;Covering the vision&amp;rdquo;. Some people are obsessed with the weight, beauty, gender, food, emotions, knowledge (big egotrip - I show you how much I know)&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Know Brahman in the buddhi, where it manifests as sakshi, spreading to all the koshash.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sukshma shariram - lingam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pranamajakosha is nothing but pancha prana along with panca karmeindriyani. Born from rajasamsha of all subtle elements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manomaya is one which has nature of doubting (mind).&lt;/strong> Five jnaneindriyam + antarkaranam. Born out of sattvaguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vijnanamaya - faculty of determination, conclusion, decision.&lt;/strong> Five jnaneindriaym (common in manomaya and vijnanamaya) and decision faculty (buddhi).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subtle body is split into three koshas because of different functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anandamayakosha - karana shariram. Malina-sattvam (tamo misrita sattvam). Made out of priya, moda, pramoda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whenever (any) jnanam arises is because of sattva.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is mine cannot be I.&lt;/strong> E.g. My car. Yet for physical body, mind etc. we sometimes use I and sometimes my.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Viveka: separate what is inherent, intrinsic and what is incidental,&lt;/strong> what comes and goes. This method is called anvaya vyatireka, which establishes cause-effect relationship or anuvrti (continuity - of atma) vyavrti (variability - of kosha) also. Example: pot and clay.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>atma is invariably present like a thread.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Physically you cannot separate an object from an all-pervasive entity.&lt;/strong> Intellectually to cut mis-identification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no necessity for a thoughtless state (samadi). Just understand that a thought is mithya.&lt;/strong> And it cannot bother you. &lt;strong>Without a thought you can exist. A thought cannot exist without you.&lt;/strong> Presence of thoughts or they absence doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any difference to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m not related to them and they are not related to me. It is a mithya sambandha = no sambandha. Level of reality has to be the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga has a philosophy of sankhya. They consider a thought as real and therefore they want samadi. Because they consider both Purusha and Prakrti independent and satyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you don&amp;rsquo;t place the I in any of the limited koshas - you have no limitation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you have a pain and go to a dream you&amp;rsquo;re not experiencing the pain.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The gross body and whole sthula prapanca is not experienced in dream. You experience sukshma prapanca. In svapna there is a vyatireka of sthula shariram and I the consciousness is evident continuously (anvaya).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ahamkara is part of the subtle body, of the mind. Ego - I sense. Ahamkara - I thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Physical body is - I&amp;rsquo;m. Physical body is not - I&amp;rsquo;m. Sukshma shariram is - I&amp;rsquo;m. Sukshma shariram is not - I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;hellip; vyavrti - anuvrti.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="15-chapter-1-40---42">15: Chapter 1: 40 - 42&lt;/h1>

&lt;li>Guru and shastra are complementary. One is not valid without the backing of the other. &lt;strong>Ultimately guru imparts knowledge through atma-anatma viveka&lt;/strong>. Through this jivatvam is basically displaced.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The teaching is basically only one - you are the limitless Brahman&lt;/strong>, the association with three koshas is only incidental. They are not part of the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If I exist in the absence of gross body (etc.), then it proves I&amp;rsquo;m not the gross body.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>You need TX, because you were born. Why should I be born? Well that proves the problem of ajnanam is there.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sravanam and mananam gives one clear knowledge about oneself. It is a source of knowledge. Niddidhiasana is not. It is there to allow one the claim the status learned in sravanam and mananam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In one who&amp;rsquo;s done niddidhiasanam jnanam is active. He knows he&amp;rsquo;s free from all gunas, he&amp;rsquo;s all-pervasive. There is no sushupti (karana sharira, ignorance) for him. He knows those are not his nature, as he knows who he is all the time. Thus vyavrti (absence) of andamayakosha / karana shariram / ignorance takes place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you study svapna, sthula sharira vyavrti takes place. When you study sushupti, sukshma sharira vyvarti takes place. &lt;strong>In samadhi / niddidhiasana (having claimed the knowledge who I&amp;rsquo;m all the time) vyavrti of karana sharira takes place.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Chandogya upanishad 6. chapter towards the end: Gandhara desha drsthanta (~ Dante: Divine Comedy). A man was kidnapped and blindfolded and thrown into a forest. Blindfolding - ignorance and tying to samsara. Dumped into pancha kosha forest. Full of wild animals like raga, dvesha, etc. Ultimately he&amp;rsquo;s rescued by the guru and taken to his home, to Brahman.&lt;/strong> Home is one where you go after a lot of wandering (~ Odysseus).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I see myself as a body, there will be comparison to other bodies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddhist, Charvakas etc. - they have analyzed, not separated (ishika - sharp grass) properly and came to wrong conclusions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The very thought of shunyam proves consciousness. Something must be there which is not shunyam and talks about it. You&amp;rsquo;d be non-existent to prove shunyam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kathaupanishad: atma is known by such people who are having a very sharp intellect thus are able to segregate in the mind (the self from three bodies).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Logic based on shruti, not independent logic, does the three bodies separation. Apply your brain to understand shruti statements (not to create new theories).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinmudra. Three fingers have beginning an end. Index finger and thumb forming a circle are a cycle, no beginning, no end. Purnam. We do chinmudra when we like something.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Kartrtvam and bhoktrtvam belong to the mind, anatma, not consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ego is very ready to claim anything as its own. Associating it with I.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you don&amp;rsquo;t separate (analyze) properly, samsara continues.&lt;/strong> You will not get central piece - ishika, but keep hurting yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pure logician are most illogical -&amp;gt; take help of shruti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sambhavita yukti: logic used to establish that Vedanta is not irrational.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every meaning reveals its meaning by a particular method. This method is called vrtti - mode or matter. &lt;strong>Mukhyaartaha - direct, primary meaning&lt;/strong>, which is the immediate meaning which occurs in your mind. &lt;strong>Lakshiartam - secondary meaning.&lt;/strong> Lakshanavrti - method by which a word reveals secondary meaning. Gaunivrtti - a method by which a word reveals its meaning in a figurative way. &lt;strong>Gaunaartaha - figurative meaning&lt;/strong>. Example: calling a swami a lion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahavakya reveals oneness between Jiva and Paramatma through lakshanavrtti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jahati, ajahati, jahat-ajahat lakshana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jahati lakshanam (&lt;strong>-&lt;/strong>) - primary meaning is totally given up and connected meaning is taken. Example: I read Vivekananda a lot (give up &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;, understand &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo;). India plays against Russia. He drank a bottle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ajahati lakshanam (&lt;strong>+&lt;/strong>) - primary meaning is retained and extra meaning is added. Example: Car is coming -&amp;gt; Car + driver. I ordered a pizza -&amp;gt; pizza + plate + cutlery is brought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jahatajahat lakshanam (&lt;strong>-/+&lt;/strong>) - &lt;strong>bhaga (portion) tyaga (giving up)&lt;/strong>. From the primary meaning a part is given up. I ate three bananas (without the skin). He visited India.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aham - primary meaning: physical, subtle, causal body and consciousness.&lt;/strong> Normally we use only partial meaning from all this. I&amp;rsquo;m lean. I&amp;rsquo;m emotional person&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you use &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; only for the consciousness?&lt;/strong> -&amp;gt; aikyam.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Unless you work on a word, it might not reveal its meaning. You&amp;rsquo;ve to do laksanah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara - creator. Jiva - created. There never can be oneness. Unless you give up part of the primary meaning -&amp;gt; do laksanah.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Praktrti is threefold. Sattvapradanaparkti is one not contaminated by the other two. Brahman reflected in sattvapradanaparkti is called nimittakarana, sarvagnaha, sarvashaktiman. Efficient cause of creating the universe, knowledge how to create and creative power. Associated in tamahpradanaprakti he becomes material cause of creation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say reflected you need a consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Direct meaning of tat = Iswara = Brahman + reflected consciousness + sattvapradanaparkti + tamahpradanaprakti. Karanabrahman - creator. Swami.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Direct meaning of tvam = Jiva = Brahman + reflected consciousness + malina sattva (i.e. rajapradanaprakrti - kama, karma, karmaphala etc.). Karyambrahman - creature. Dasa.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advaita Vedantis vs. Vishistaadvaitins: soham -&amp;gt; dasoham -&amp;gt; sadasoham&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any reflection (chitabhasa) is non-separate from the original (chaytanyam). You cannot separate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you remove the (reflective) medium, the reflection is gone too. Example: sun in the bucket of water.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>tat tvam asi&lt;/em> works only after bhaga tyaga laksana and keeping only Brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mithya - once you understand that a given thing is not there even though are experiencing it. Like sunrise. Only cognitively you are negating. Jiva, Jagat, Iswara will will not go. If it would go perceptually as well, it is asat - sunyam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sakshi moves in all the three states and does not carry anything from one into other. Therefore it is asangah. Consciousness stands independent of everything. Prakrti needs Brahman to proves its existence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Division is mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Example: recognizing a person after many years. The attributes (hair color, weight, status, height, health, ideas, knowledge&amp;hellip;) are different. You have to drop them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="18-chapter-1-47---49">18: Chapter 1: 47 - 49&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Recognition = memory (&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo;, smrti) + perception (&amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo;, pratyaksha)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This (ayam) devadatta is that (sah) devadatta, if you drop non-essential attributes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Working for moksha is a gross mistake. It will mean moksha it will come in future. Paramatma is free from attributes right now!&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Less attributes, more pervasive. No attributes = all-pervasive, limitless.&lt;/strong> If it is limitless, it covers the subject and object also. &lt;strong>It covers both and transcends them, because subject are object are limited.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once no attributes are there it cannot become object of your knowledge. You have to understand limitless in terms of subject. It cannot become an object.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nobody can gain limitlessness (moksha). Any gain is limited in time and space. You are moksha. What you are working on is removing ignorance.&lt;/strong> You are free at this very moment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any kind of TX is only possible when the subtle body enters sthula body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In a given life, you enter into several bodies. One gives up ID with the gross body and enters into a dream body. Therefore punar janma is possible. One cannot negate it.&lt;/strong> You can say I don&amp;rsquo;t care about it, but you cannot really say there is no punar janma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sravanam - systematic scriptural study for a length of time under an competent acharya. &lt;strong>One should study until one understands the aikyam and claims the brahmanhood.&lt;/strong> Until I can say I&amp;rsquo;m brahman the jagatkaranam. &lt;strong>Until I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself as a small speck in the creation but see the creation as a small speck in me.&lt;/strong> Kayvalya upanishad: Mayieva sakalam jatam. Mayi sarvam pratisthitam. Mayi sarvam layam jati. Tat brahmana advaya asmi aham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mananam is not over yet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every pramana has its field.&lt;/strong> Eyes - color and forms. Nose - smell. Ears - sounds&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Vedanta sastra - atma. What one source of knowledge gives you cannot be known through any other source of knowledge&lt;/strong> (anadigatatvam - uniqueness). It should not be contradicted by any other pramanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tatvamasi is reported nine times with different examples in Chandogya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Science says there is no sunrise. Eyes say there is sunrise. Thus there is illusion, but no contradiction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Job of &lt;strong>mananam: we have to find out if Vedanta sastra pramanam is contradicted by any other pramanam or not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="19-chapter-1-49-50-mananam">19: Chapter 1: 49, 50: mananam&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Your knowledge should be free of doubts. &lt;strong>Doubtful knowledge is as good as ignorance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What Vedanta gives you cannot be given to you by any other means of knowledge. Nor it can be doubted by any other means of knowledge.&lt;/strong> Example: can ears doubt what eyes reveal?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Subject cannot be revealed by the senses because senses are revealed by the subject.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without any features try to see and then describe an(y) object.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Activity, function of the word is to reveal the meaning.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nirguna brahman means totally free from features. There is no activity for words.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishesha = features in an object. Words can reveal only savishesha vastu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman is not revealed by the words Upanishads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you say Brahman is sagunaha, then he is mithya. Nirgunah Brahman one cannot speak about (and thus is not revealed) because there are no attributes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever and whatever you are experiencing, it is an object with features.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I want to negate your philosophy then there must not be any logical fallacy in mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>An attribute (guna) always resides in a substance (dravyam). It is never independent.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="20-chapter-1-50-51">20: Chapter 1: 50, 51&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sastram: &lt;strong>an individual has basically oneness with Isvara. There are two names, but not two entities.&lt;/strong> Mananam: now we&amp;rsquo;re checking if there are doubts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nirvishesha vastu cannot be there in the creation.&lt;/strong> How can anyone know and experience that? No attributes reside in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge is knowledge only when it is free from doubts.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Substance and attributes becomes savishesha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attributesless substance cannot be supporter of attributes - &lt;strong>vadato vyagataha (contradiction)&lt;/strong>. Nirguna supporting guna &amp;hellip; Like telling a person I&amp;rsquo;m observing silence since 10 years. Also this would admit the existence nirguna substance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atmaasraya (self-dependence)&lt;/strong> is a dosha. A cannot be supporter of A. I cannot sit in my own lap. In any relationship there need to be two things. Supporting must be different from supporter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mutual dependence (anyonya ashraya)&lt;/strong> is a dosha. Person A cannot borrow from person B who is also about to ask to borrow from him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cyclicity (cakraatmakaha)&lt;/strong>, e.g.: A -&amp;gt; B -&amp;gt; C -&amp;gt; A, is also a dosha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infinite regression (anavasta dosha)&lt;/strong>: you keep on doing and doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and still not arrive at what is savishesham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any dvaita sastra which is not accepting nirvishesha vastu will have these five doshas. Because it has to accept attributes and substance independently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trying to understand saguna. &lt;strong>If both, attributes and substance are real, you will have to come up with a relationship between them but you will only find the five doshas. The only explanation that makes sense is &amp;ldquo;mithya&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="21-chapter-1-repetition">21: Chapter 1: (repetition)&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Basically Pancadasi is meant for mananam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What I&amp;rsquo;m conscious of is changing that I&amp;rsquo;m conscious is not. The consciousness is the invariable factor in all experiences.&lt;/strong> (cit-sat)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Satyam - what is all the time there, what doesn&amp;rsquo;t come and go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What I love is always changing. But &lt;strong>there is one thing that I love all the time - I - the subject.&lt;/strong>
&lt;strong>If I love myself unconditionally, then I must be the source of happiness.&lt;/strong> (ananda). Source - all the time supplying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the deep sleep state (total ignorance) we don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem. In the waking state jnani doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem (total knowledge - no wrong notion pertaining to the self).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Samsara: having a natural desire to transform myself. I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with what I&amp;rsquo;m now. This is the product of avidya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trigunaatmika prakrti: 1) sattvagunaprakrti - maya 2) tamahpradanaprakti - prakrti 3) rajapradanaprakrti - avidya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rajapradanaprakrti is anadi. Thus Jiva (rajapradanaprakrti + Brahman) is anadi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birth is give for one purpose only: to get fulfillment. Easiest way is to study Pancadasi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a knower, doer, enjoyer you are limited. Thus you want more and more. And you look at yourself as an incomplete person. Until the time for this body is over, then Isvara gives punar janma and so on, until one is lucky (punyam) and comes to this teaching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>three things possible only through grace of Isvara: manusyatvam, mumuksutvam, association with a good teacher.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Effective sravanam means one has to study consistently for a long time under the guidance of a teacher. Giving up the identification with body and mind. Drg-drsya viveka through the method of anvaya-vyatireka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To know yourself you have to go to somebody else. It is like to see your face.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wrong notions are due toe avidya, thus anadi. Therefore to drop false notion which create a sense of limitation takes time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="22-chapter-1-50">22: Chapter 1: 50&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the doubts are not resolved, I cannot go further to niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two kinds: &lt;strong>interpretational doubts happen to people who are not learning from traditional teachers.&lt;/strong> These are more serious. The other are logical doubts. These can go away with repeated sravanam and approaching the teacher for clarification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Logicians: there is no such thing as nirgunam. If Vedanta reveals Brahman, it must be saguna. It hast at least one attribute, that&amp;rsquo;s difference from what reveals it (Vedanta).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to make myself free from the process of becoming, because any becoming involves limitation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attributes always reside in substance. Therefore every substance is all the time saguna only. Thus you will never find a nirguna substance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saguna fallacy: &lt;strong>What nature is the substance on which the guna (attribute) rests?&lt;/strong> See class # 20 for possible answers and their illogicality. -&amp;gt; mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Anyonya asraya (mutual dependence) for peace, happiness, security never works.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantins: &lt;strong>since the creation is mithya, any model is good for me.&lt;/strong> Prasna Upanishad: no element. Chandogya: three elements. Taittriya: five elements. Upanishads themselves have no consistency. Ultimately the creation is not there at all, but a person entering into Vedanta will not understand this. He needs a lot of preparation before this can be assimilated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="23-chapter-1-50-51">23: Chapter 1: 50, 51&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If an object has attributes, it becomes an object of knowledge. If atma has attributes, it can never be the subject. Anything that has attributes, will be subject to change, is born and will go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mananam deals with logical doubts. Doubtful knowledge can never be assimilated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Difference between two things allows to distinguish between them. Difference is a properly (guna).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsaris have all the time complains, agony, suffering because what they want from the world they cannot derive. &lt;strong>We are basically interested in peace, security and happiness. In nothing else, not in other people, charity, Isvara &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nirguna brahman cannot be experienced nor logically derived, because logic requires words.&lt;/strong> If it could be revealed this revelation would automatically produce bheda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Any substance with a property, any object can never be explained what it is. That&amp;rsquo;s why we call it mithya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Movie cannot be separated from the screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plurality has no independent reality. Trying to find relationships between appearances is full of logical fallacies. Give up the idea of saguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="24-chapter-1-52-53">24: Chapter 1: 52, 53&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Substance (dravyam) is that which supports attributes (guna). Analysis of their &amp;ldquo;relationship&amp;rdquo; leads to the five fallacies. They are not really two different things. You are seeing plurality because of Maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you give reality to this dvaita prapancha it becomes cause of samsara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no way out of samsara, plurality but to wake up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once prapancha has been negated, then where is the question of using the word &amp;ldquo;nirguna&amp;rdquo;. Like &amp;ldquo;adhisthanam&amp;rdquo;. Once you stop giving reality to the mithya, then there is no adhisthanam.&lt;/strong> Same for &amp;ldquo;sakshi&amp;rdquo;, it is introduced because people consider the three states as real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For relationship you require at least one thing different than you. Where is the question of holding on to words like &amp;ldquo;asanga&amp;rdquo; once you understand there is nothing but &amp;ldquo;One&amp;rdquo; thing. &lt;strong>Advaia, asanga &amp;hellip; all words belong to the world, to vyavahara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mithya example: 17 elephants. 1/2 to elder son. 1/3 to second son. 1/9 to last son.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma is unconnected, not associated at all with either saguna nor nirguna. Since we perceive and give reality to the gunas, we say atma is nirguna so that you can withdraw reality given to the word (world).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teaching itself is mithya. Brahmavidya is mithya. Teacher is mithya. Student is mithya. &lt;em>Na sasta na sastram na sishyo na siksha&lt;/em> All this is in the realm of vyavahara. Brahman itself is not mithya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve understood that I&amp;rsquo;m Brahman no word is necessary and no word can reveal it also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Cit&amp;rdquo; is also vyavahara. Any word is. Why should I say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m consciousness?&amp;rdquo; All words pertaining to Brahman are parts of the teaching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not a karta yet you are working as a karta. You&amp;rsquo;re not a bhokta yet you become a bokta at 12:00am. Every triputi is mithya (karta, karma, karanam &amp;hellip;) You like singing singing &amp;ldquo;Citananda shivovham&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. No worry, keep on singing. &lt;strong>All vyavara is mithya.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;re not obliged to answer to anybody. We&amp;rsquo;re not going to lose anything if we don&amp;rsquo;t reply. Whatever the other says is mithya.&lt;/strong> Our intellect should be free from doubts. &lt;strong>We should convince ourselves, we might not convince others.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mananam: &lt;strong>One should go through one cycle: few Upanishads, Gita and if possible the four sutras of Brahmasutra. Then one should see if doubts are there.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mananam addresses intellectual issues. It will not help with emotional issues. These are addressed by niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="25-chapter-1-54-niddidhiasanam">25: Chapter 1: 54 Niddidhiasanam&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Meditation (niddidhiasanam) cannot give Moksha. Moksha is already my nature. Anything produced can give only what I don&amp;rsquo;t have yet and is finite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation cannot give Atmajnanam. It is not a pramana. Sravanam alone gives you aparoksha jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation is not meant to give you (a mumukshu) a new experience. Any experience falls into the objective field, which is different than the subject. Moksha has to do with subject.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vayragya: drop anything that is bound by time and space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re not denying extraordinary experiences. We&amp;rsquo;re just questioning their utility for Moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedanta analyses experiences but is not in search of new and extraordinary ones.&lt;/strong> The three states of experience are enough for us to arrive at the knowledge of the self and gain moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Niddidhiasanam: (vedantic) meditation is meant to assimilate teaching received through sravanam. Goal: emotional issues gone&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All emotional issues are habitual.&lt;/strong> So consciously remove the subconscious notions through niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moksha = emotional soundness. Samsara: emotional issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re ready for niddidhiasanam when you&amp;rsquo;re convinced that you&amp;rsquo;ve doubtless knowledge&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Niddidhiasanam is of two types: &lt;strong>1) constant alertness to every situation during waking state so that the response is based in keeping with the teaching,&lt;/strong> (BG 5.8-9: &lt;em>pasyan srvnam sprsan &amp;hellip; naiva kincit karomiti yukto manyete tattva-vit&lt;/em>) &lt;strong>2) BG 6: you sit and spend time exclusively with a specific deeper issue&lt;/strong> that makes you suffer a lot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vicikitsa = samshaya = doubt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mananam: deals with the &lt;strong>basic doubt &amp;ldquo;How can I be Brahman?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. Not some minor doubts like are there 17 or 19 parts of sukshma sharira etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re taking only the last three steps from Yogashastra. Dharanam - fixing the mind, letting the thought centered, on the Self, I. Ekathanatvam (dhyayam) - concentration. Having fixed, retain the flow of thoughts on the Self. Samadhi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mithya = non separate (from the real).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Just drop the notions about yourself and you&amp;rsquo;ll be left with what&amp;rsquo;s reality about you. Never think &amp;ldquo;my mind will illumine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> The mind will basically drop the notions.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="26-chapter-1-55">26: Chapter 1: 55&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vedantic meditation (niddidhiasanam) = fixing the mind on Brahman -&amp;gt; dropping the wrong notion pertaining to the self. Example: What &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; is it that fears? The body/mind one. The real &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; is fearless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep consciously dissimilar thoughts (=pertaining to anatma) away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not repetition &amp;ldquo;aham asangah&amp;rdquo; all over. &lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;re not particular about entertaining the same thought. But on similar thoughts pertaining to atma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pick a few words like ananda, nityam, suddham, buddham, muktam, asangam, advitiyam and write few lines about them and ponder about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t require to sit for more than 15 minutes. 2-3x a day is good.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Other various types of niddidhiasanam: keep listening again and again, discussion with someone else, sharing - teaching.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedantic samadhi is possible consequence of niddidhiasanam. It means absorption and is normal, natural faculty of every mind. Has nothing to do with mysticism.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you start thinking in a given line, mind can gradually absorb in that thing. &lt;strong>Generally we&amp;rsquo;re absorbed in our own worries. Here the object of absorption is the self.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samadhi = Total absorption (&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;being in flow&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>) with the object of meditation. Not the yogic &amp;ldquo;no thought&amp;rdquo; state, which is very similar to deep-sleep state.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If any kind of experience which removes self-ignorance (gives knowledge) is of benefit to us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Autobiografy - all notions regarding the person&amp;hellip; Remove notions to reveal the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Anything you gain in the life, you will not be free from suffering.&lt;/strong> You have to knock off the notion I&amp;rsquo;m not samsari. For reaching one&amp;rsquo;s own abode, one&amp;rsquo;s own home, comfort, there is no way. No marga.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogis - in the process of destroying the mind. Ashtanga yoga is ultimately to kill the mind. Vedanta says mind is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogic samadhi won&amp;rsquo;t give jnanam, nor will remove obstacles. Removing obstacles requires thinking. Resolving the mind is escapism from realism of life, not facing, resolving the problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogic samadhi - jada samadhi. Avidya vrtti is there. Experience is not knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vedantic samadhi is like paddling the cycle. Initially will (=effort) is required, but then those thoughts remain in the mind by sheer habit. Without will based effort.&lt;/strong> Will means ahamkara is involved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantic samadhi: I&amp;rsquo;m right now dwelling on that, that kind of awareness is not there. Just similar thoughts pertaining to the self - the teaching - remain. Very effort of retaining is not there.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="27-chapter-1-56---58">27: Chapter 1: 56 - 58&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Effort is always based on the will. And will is based on the meditator. Drop the will and only object of meditation in which you&amp;rsquo;re absorbed remains. That is vedantic nirvikalpa samadhi.&lt;/strong> Like reading a book you love. You don&amp;rsquo;t know you&amp;rsquo;re a reader reading a book.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even in nirvikalpaka samadhi vrttis are there. Yet their presence is not recognized because ahamkara does not function. &lt;strong>When ahamkara is dormant and a vrtti raises it is called sukshma vrtti.&lt;/strong> Knower is not present. If he is, it is sthula vrtti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In shusupti knowledge regarding to ignorance (tamovrtti, avidyavrtti) is there. You have memory of sleeping well, but not during the experience because the knower is sleeping.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every memory is born out of experience. It is the proof thereof.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In yogic samadhi avidyavrtti are there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Self-forgetfulness is the biggest problem of every seeker.&lt;/strong> Generally the problem is not absorption, but retention. Solution: just continue niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Our job is to drop all wrong notions pertaining to the self.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sandal = pair. Raga dvesha = pair. Once you wear sandals &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Teaching should go to subconscious.&lt;/strong> Then you need not worry, it is always with you. Because in conscious mind only few things remain (5 entries, a lot of input and traffic) and go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bashyakara: In every janma acquire more and more of these samskaras pertaining to atma. You require initially conscious effort (a lot of) and then it becomes samskara. At this stage &lt;strong>reduce worldly activity&lt;/strong>. Don&amp;rsquo;t engage too much in the world. This is why Jagnyavalkya has retired - to assimilate what he already knew.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is a serious affair, yet nothing to be worried about. It is very time consuming. Every day until death, until you go to sleep entertain thoughts regarding to the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Constantly generate punyam. Pancha maha yagnyas. Have religious life. And constantly form vedantic habits through niddidhiasanam.&lt;/strong> Be like a flame in a breezeless room, let not the mind go into anatma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Job and phalam of niddidhiasanam: bring everything out of subconscious mind. Certain thoughts might arise because of old habits, but you will be in charge of those because of niddidhiasanam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samadhi is a possible consequence but not a must. Like reading a book. You dn&amp;rsquo;t understand it only when you are totally absorbed in that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A true character of a person can be only known by studying him in a provocative situation. Then subconscious personality comes into play, conscious one is overpowered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t give importance to formal meditation. But to being emerged in the teaching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is contrary to experience (anubhava), logic (yukti), sastra (sruti) we have to negate.&lt;/strong> Be careful around yogic sastras. For them samadhi is the pinacle, sravanam least important. Vedanta gives most importance to sravanam, mananam and niddidhiasanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>glorification of samadhi by yoga sastra:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>samadhi destroys all sanchita karmas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samadhi increases shudha punya karma. Any karma will cause punya and some papam as well. Even puja as we might not do it flawlessly. By samadhi punyam only will increase by huge amount, no papam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samadhi dissolves all viparita bhavana - all emotional issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samadhi uprootes the tree of karma. Destroys the ignorance (root) and all sanchita karmas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mahavakya becomes free of all obstacles and becomes capable of doing its job - giving aparoksha jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t accept. Knowledge, not samadhi destroys sanchita karmas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t accept. Punyam is result of karma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Totally acceptably. &lt;strong>Emotional freedom is the main benefit of samadhi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and 5. Not acceptable. Only jnanam destroys punya papam. This is beautifully said in Mundakopanishad. Samadhi is state where no new knowledge is generated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>immediate knowledge - &lt;strong>aparoksha jnanam = that brahman is myself -&amp;gt; mukti&lt;/strong>. Only mahavakya gives that. That&amp;rsquo;s the tatparyam of all upanishads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When aparoksha jnanam is there in the intellect along with obstacles (emotional, intellectual) then we call it paroksha jnanam. Paroksha jnanam doesn&amp;rsquo;t give mukti.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sravanam gives knowledge, mananam removes intellectual obstacles, niddidhiasanam emotional ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Getting angry, jealous etc. in a situation is a habit. &lt;strong>All emotional issues are habitual errors that have the basis in taking the body mind as oneself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pratibhandas don&amp;rsquo;t go in one day. If you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for some kind of incident that resolves all obstacles - that day will never come. &lt;strong>Removing obstacles is growing clarity. It&amp;rsquo;s a process, not a momentary event.&lt;/strong> Otherwise we&amp;rsquo;ll wait for something special to happen. This is a gradual process like braking the day. Or just like studying at the college - clarity grows slowly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create more and more space in understanding that I&amp;rsquo;m not the body/mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="29-chapter-1-63---65">29: Chapter 1: 63 - 65&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Paroksha jnanam will eliminate all the papa karmas of the sishya. Student&amp;rsquo;s ahamkara and mamakara are greatly reduces because he knows these are false identification with the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Interpretional obstacles give birth to new philosophies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is a relationship between pot and clay? Mirage water and desert? Body and self? &lt;strong>Sathya-mithya relationship is no relationship.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Paroksha jnanam will eliminate agami papam. You will not not do deliberately do any papa-karma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Until you get some maturity in your niddidhiasanam follow your sadhana chatustaya champati. So it will be your second nature and you are spontaneously dharmic. Deliberate papa karma is impossible. For what? There is no kama in his heart that compels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a person sees everything as himself where is the desire? You don&amp;rsquo;t have a desire for what you are but for something other than you&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma reveals its own existence. Light of lights - jotisham joti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What is not self-evident and self-existent is mithya. And it should not be counted. Therefore there is one entity in the creation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Apratibandhaka aparoksha jnanam&lt;/strong> (claming &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m free here and now&amp;rdquo;). It &lt;strong>gives you jivan-mukti.&lt;/strong> Thus one will not have punar janma. Subtle body was given to you to learn what you are, once you know, there will be no purpose.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="qa">Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>in vyavahara the reflected consciousness is involved but your nature is witness consciousness.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m not waker - reflected consciousness, I&amp;rsquo;m witness of the waker. Waker is the direct meaning of the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; - vachyarta. Lakshyarta is witness consciousness. Let the citabhasa do the vyavahara, but know (think) that your real nature, the real &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; is the witness consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m conscious of the body, the body is not conscious of myself. The two are distinct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jiva - individual - includes the body in the word &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>Step 1: understanding I&amp;rsquo;m consciousness (through bhaga tyaga; atma anatma viveka). Step 2: understanding that that consciousness is limitless through mahavakya&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience is always in the form of the vrtti, impression of the mind. Depending on the presence of the knower (ahamkara), it will be a sukshma or sthula vrtti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sarvam kalvidam brahman. All names and forms (creation) are brahman. But brahman is not names and forms (creation).&lt;/strong> Water can exist without being a wave, but wave cannot exist without water. Beggar is actor, actor is not beggar at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both deep sleep and yogic samadhi give experience of non-dual state. But samadhi-one can be described afterwards. &lt;strong>Experience of non-duality is not knowledge of non-duality&lt;/strong>. People coming out of samadhi don&amp;rsquo;t know after it that whatever they experience is mithya. Their ajnanam continues. &lt;strong>Experience of non-duality is not a good teacher thereof&lt;/strong>. What is needed is the understanding.&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="class-14-31-32--what-is-anatma">Class 14: 31, 32 &amp;hellip; What is anAtmA?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>sat&lt;/strong> na bhavati, &lt;strong>asat&lt;/strong> na bhavati, &lt;strong>ubhayAtmikA&lt;/strong> na bhavati&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Maya and its product do not commander category of existent entity. But you cannot say opposite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anirvachaynia - seemingly existent, Experientially available. On probing mysterious.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like dream world. You cannot say existent or non-existent. When we are in dream the dream world comes into &amp;ldquo;existent&amp;rdquo; category. It is experientable, transactionable and useful. Yet on waking up it disappears.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="1-imagination-vs-acceptance-mechanical-vs-wonderfull">1: imagination vs. acceptance, mechanical vs. wonder(full)&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Your attachment to the name and form acts like a shield to cover up the reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even while seeing the name and form you see through the name and form and then you&amp;rsquo;re in communion with reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re awareness of the waking state. Not the world and person that shines through it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsara is put in place by identification with the gunas because of ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever happens through ignorance it does not really happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever you&amp;rsquo;re really afraid doesn&amp;rsquo;t really exist.&lt;/strong> It is caused by ignorance. Imagination: parents imagine something about the situation of the children and think that it the fear is caused by the actual situation of the children&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagination, thinking, &amp;hellip; puts attachment, fears, desires in place. &lt;strong>If you say it&amp;rsquo;s difficult than it&amp;rsquo;s difficult. If you say you&amp;rsquo;re not worried than you&amp;rsquo;re not worried. Samsara is there if you believe it is there.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desires, fears are seeds for all kinds of actions -&amp;gt; bondage. Unless the action is done without regard to the result (karmayoga). Yoga = &amp;ldquo;Roast the seed&amp;rdquo; - give up all the actions born out of desire. Life will go on very smoothly. Desires don&amp;rsquo;t give but only disrupt it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without desire you&amp;rsquo;ll not have any fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yoga - communion with the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t be greedy. Keep your honest profession. But don&amp;rsquo;t be an ambitious, competitive worldly person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be outside of the flow of the for a time. Don&amp;rsquo;t allow it to wonder from one place to the other. Use the mind but don&amp;rsquo;t have the mind use you. And it will resolve in its source. Remain thoughtless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ll know the real nature of the world only when you step back. When you&amp;rsquo;re art part you can&amp;rsquo;t. How do you become familiar with the world? - through the mind. Stop the flow of the thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>By knowing the movement of the mind you can conquer the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation -&amp;gt; reaching the source of all life (cause of all the movement) and consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>40 days challenge: stay thoughtless for 10 days for 5, later 7 minutes. Then increase to 10, then to 12.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation effects the character of the person/mind. In meditation you discover the weakness of the mind and the very knowing of it helps you to overcome it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sattvaguna - remaining alert and watchful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakti - taking the spirit by the action (if there is such). Inner dimension.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakti - receiving sukha/dukha with equanimity of mind. Rising above good/evil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakti - recognising, &lt;strong>never being forgetful of the cosmic will all the time. Everything perceived is the glory of Isvara. If my personal will is pitted against Isvara&amp;rsquo;s, I surrender mine (sharanagatih).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Asura - given to the life of worldly pleasures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gurudom - mutual exploitation. Guru exploits the sishya and sishya exploits the guru.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wealth - being the trustee of Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defining characteristics of a student of vedanta: absence of comparison, competitiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We should not have any companionship in life except satsanga. If it&amp;rsquo;s part of your duty, speak. If part of satsanga, speak. Rest of the time - maunam.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spirit of &amp;ldquo;feet of Isvara&amp;rdquo; = sharangatih. Acceptance is the main spirit of sharanagatih.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mechanical -&amp;gt; repetitive -&amp;gt; dull mind. With a dull mind you will not be able to know the truth. You&amp;rsquo;ll need all creativity of the mind for it. Do it with love, devotion, not mechanically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are putting demands (on the guru) there will be no surrender. They are mutually exclusive. All your agende is given up. All Ishvara&amp;rsquo;s agenda for you is welcomed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rising sun - linga (sign) of Isvara. Not sun worshippers, worship is of Isvara only! &lt;strong>Suppose you don&amp;rsquo;t get any amazement, you&amp;rsquo;ve converted it into something mechanical.&lt;/strong> Any time you look at lingas like sun, moon there must be freshness of present movement. This way you have to visit a temple.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="2-presence-in-the-heart-space-identification">2: presence in the heart-space; identification&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sarvam kalvidam Brahman. Jagat eva harih. Harih eva jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have conflict in your heart, you&amp;rsquo;ll see only conflict in the heart. What you have in yourself (in your heart) that you see in the world. Start with your heart - see the presence of Isvara in your heart. Feel it. The world is an image of your heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Temple (you feel the presence of god) -&amp;gt; heart.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kama is the chief villain. Then krodha (hate), lobha (greed), moha (infatuation - loving an inanimate object, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t love you back), mada (ego), matsarya (jealousy).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vivekananda: preliminary devotion - give and take devotion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love - the only solution for conflict. But being ignorant one doesn&amp;rsquo;t know this. So one resolves to violence. You might be able to hurt the other person, but the conflict will remain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where is &lt;strong>Ishvara - in the heart of every living being.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life means thought-live only. What is your dominant thought makes up your life. Bhakti: thought-life should be dominated by the thought of love of all-pervasive Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seed of all affliction is in the heart - moha = ajnanam (original sin, suksha dukham - Buddha). It is destroyed by discovering by discovering Ishvara in your heart. All the sin gets destroyed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worldly people - either living in sorrow or on the verge of sorrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Presence - Purusha) Isvara transcends the domain of the indriyas. adhokSaja.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Law: whatever is put together will disintegrate. Sharira.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We become identified with the body because of the ignorance of the mind. &lt;strong>Identification = ignorance. Wise people do not identify with anything.&lt;/strong> Suppose a wise man lives in a place for a year. He just walks away &amp;hellip; nothing sticks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Staff of Moses - supreme devotion to Isvara. Mystics might know, religious guys don&amp;rsquo;t. When there is no spirit (philosophy), what remains is letter (religion).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Position of) privilege -&amp;gt; ambition, competition -&amp;gt; conflict.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deriving pleasure from (sense) objects happens through contact with sense organs. That pleasure is associated invariably with pain. If you give all pleasures you&amp;rsquo;ll not know what is pain and arrive at unsullied joy of svarupa - nirvanasukham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nirbana -&amp;gt; Nirvana. bANa - sharp piece of metal stuck in the heart. Arrow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heart is the temple and Isvara is the Lord of the temple who runs all the infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation upon Isvara - who is the space in the heart. Abide there, in the space-like being. Catch it by merging in it. Give up doing - moving, thinking. Doing is only required for preparation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upasana - going closer (to that being). You have to give up doing only in the beginning. After some abhyasa doing can be there, you&amp;rsquo;ll be fixed in the being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your best friend - not in the world, not the body, not the mind - but Isvara in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="3-desires">3: desires&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Everybody needs a home but people use homes to aggrandize the ego. Same for other things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even saddhus aggrandize their ego by saying I have so many students or ashrams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lakshmi devi doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay at one place. She&amp;rsquo;s always on the move leaving behind broken hearts&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The same 3 million dollar home that has aggrandized the ego before will pull it down later. Samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In bhoga no matter how legally acquired it is, there is always an element of impurity. Sin.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sruti says don&amp;rsquo;t use black wealth for yagna. Only legally acquired, taxed money should be used.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worship Parameshwara, not wealth and pleasures of this or other world - to gain self-knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnani&amp;rsquo;s bhakti - eka-bhakti = ananja (no-other) bhakti. Bhakti not based on division. Not putting something else in between.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve performed until now so many rituals (dream finalizations - acquired things, knowledge, experience)&amp;hellip; Are you fulfilled? Examine your knowledge. What you consider knowledge is no knowledge at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsara gets established in the thought-life of a person by creating value for desires (-&amp;gt; ritual).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kings enjoy great bhogas. What do they get? A lot of misery in the end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>An ambitious man ends in despair.&lt;/strong> Ambition fulfilled -&amp;gt; 7th heaven -&amp;gt; giddy self-satisfied condition. As a consequence (of the phala) this will prevent understanding the body, mind and the self&amp;hellip; -&amp;gt; misery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you do not have a desire, demand on god or world. Then supreme joy will come and engulf you. Desireless is godliness. Seek and desire nothing. When you&amp;rsquo;re desireless you&amp;rsquo;re spontaneously happy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karmas are performed so the results can be enjoyed by the body. Yet the body doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to you. It can break to pieces any time. It&amp;rsquo;s food for other creatures. Or it becomes ashes, or tomato (-&amp;gt; body -&amp;gt; tomato).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hrdaya grantih (knot). If grantih in the body - cancer. If in the mind - desire.&lt;/strong> Desire and fear - struggle -&amp;gt; clash, conflict as somebody else strives for the same things as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you believe something &amp;ldquo;is mine&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll suffer. There is no &amp;ldquo;my wife/husband&amp;rdquo;. There is only body&amp;rsquo;s wife/husband. Between I and the object there is one more intermediate thing - the body. Same for everything &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nothing wrong with the language (saying &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo;), the sense of mine is the problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Riches and self-aggrandizement make the people insensitive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="4-hari--stress-meditation">4: Hari &amp;amp; stress; meditation&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Not always necessary to give a name. A number might be enough for the purpose of communication.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>World doesn&amp;rsquo;t bind you. Wherever you have an ID, you&amp;rsquo;ve bound yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People easily forget that the names of god are names given to Nameless Reality. And that every name is a significant name. Names are different, the reality (vastu) is the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hari is a significant name. harati iti hari.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Stress is produced by thought. Just a thought produces stress.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more and more you connect yourself to the world, the more you&amp;rsquo;re stressed out.&lt;/strong> Withdraw the mind from the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pure mind = calm and quit mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You need to work in the world, that&amp;rsquo;s enough. You need not think about the world. You need not contemplate about the world. Conserve the mental energy. Use the energy on contemplating on Isvara.&lt;/strong> -&amp;gt; all the stress, sorrow, afflictions will get neutralised. Like snow exposed to sun&amp;rsquo;s rays. That&amp;rsquo;s why Isvara is called Hari.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hari = Hara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heart, pure Buddhi is the Vaikuntha. Contemplate on him in whatever way you can do it. You&amp;rsquo;re not going to know Isvara entirely, he&amp;rsquo;s infinite. Mind cannot grasp the infinite, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to grasp of him completely. What you can do is enough. And mind becomes pure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara abides in all lifeforms in their hearts. Meditation: visualize Isvara, whatever you know about him, in your heart. Then in the hearts in friends, foes, animals, &amp;hellip; all living beings. Learn to look at people not from the perspective of a divisive idea but from all-pervading Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind runs away into the wasteful lands of the worldliness. Bring back the mind and put it on the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A believer and a non-believer go to a temple. The believer sees Isvara due to Isvara in his heart. The non-believer sees an idol. It&amp;rsquo;s not that because there is Isvara in the temple you&amp;rsquo;ll see him there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you see Isvara in your heart you&amp;rsquo;ll see Isvara in every particle of this universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kids - don&amp;rsquo;t have discrimination. Asura balaka - wordly people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My mind has weaknesses, other persons mind has mistakes. Learn to make others happy, to respect them, to treat them well. They&amp;rsquo;re all the image of Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grow into the devotion. Make it happen. It won&amp;rsquo;t happen by itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="5-rose-and-love-trust-in-isvara-being-nobody-love-vs-attachment">5: rose and love; trust in Isvara; being nobody; love vs. attachment&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Isvara is present in the heart as the presence. Not as who or what.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No definition needed. &lt;strong>Rose - whosoever comes close gets the fragrance. I - whosoever comes close gets love.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmosphere in the jail is different but the space is not. Isvara is in the heart in the heart of the criminal just as in the heart of the saint.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love = silence = being = Isvara. Get centered in the inner silence and love becomes spontaneous. Love of the ego/mind is reaction. It becomes hate later. It is not about the person, it is about the metamorphosis of the mind later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no me/mine in that silence/love.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saka - your best friend. Always with you. Jiva and Isvara bird are never separated. Jiva is always part of Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sickness is creation of the mind. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t begin with the body but with the mind. Wearing out is a must with the body. It is the mind that says that it should not wear out and function all the time the same therefore I call it sickness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In case the body gets ill do what it takes, still the best support is Isvara. Just endure. Sickness, medicine, result &amp;hellip; is Isvara. Trust in Isvara fully.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you accumulate all the things and fail to have unconditional trust in Isvara, they won&amp;rsquo;t help you. If you have the trust, what are they good for?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conditioned mind - pre-opinionated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Artha and kama is like bubbles with short lifespan. Kids are enjoying soap bubbles, their intelligence is not enough to understand deeper things. That&amp;rsquo;s why they are amusing themselves with bubbles. Are the elders any different? Even as the colorful bubble is created it is going. It won&amp;rsquo;t stay. It will perish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Like a cat closing eyes trying to drink the milk it should be not. We do not pay attention to the ephemeral nature of the things. Law of the casino: only the house wins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Securities. The moment we remember them we become insecure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secret of attachment: deep rooted belief - with this wealth, I&amp;rsquo;m somebody. Without it I&amp;rsquo;m nobody. People do not like to be a nobody. It is just imagination. &lt;strong>The day you love to be a nobody you&amp;rsquo;re liberated.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security - you&amp;rsquo;ve got a piece of paper and the wealth sits with somebody else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Life is a travel in the ship. Samsara is samudra (ocean). Body is the ship. There will be shipwreck and then your wealth will pull you down.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All this is meant for dispassion, not to make you sad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prana - breath going in (brana?). It is not yours, it belongs to the whole. Do you really think you own land? Land is always land, people come and people go. There is no question of owning anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Swami TV: I love to be nobody. I love to be in the audience, not on the stage (unless I have to). You&amp;rsquo;re not counted when you&amp;rsquo;re the audience. On the stage you become somebody - attached to name and fame.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Richman - one who is giving away things that come to him all the time. Accumulation - poor man w. vacuum in his heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If the mold of the husband/wife is there I can love only conditionally (=attachment). Because the mold is there. There will be an agenda that goes with the image.&lt;/strong> If the other fulfills the agenda, I love him/her&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t look at the other as wife. Look at her as she is. If you don&amp;rsquo;t give importance to the image, you won&amp;rsquo;t give importance to the agenda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be devoted to the individual, not to the image. True love will blossom. In true love there is no demand. Only giving. Not taking. If you seek, that is not pure love, that is attachment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love and sentimentality are different.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is regrettable that most of us desire to shape the child that it gratifies our own vanity. This is attachment. Same for owning/dominating the children. Telling them what they should think. Rather tell them how to think.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Khalil Gibran: &lt;em>Your children are not your children, they are Life&amp;rsquo;s (cosmic life - Hiranyagarbha) longing for itself. They come through you, but not from you. Though they are with you, yet they don&amp;rsquo;t belong with you. You might give them your love, but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies, but not their souls. For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you, for life goes not backwards, nor terries with yesterday. You&amp;rsquo;re the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent for. The Archer sees the mark on the park of the infinite. And bends you with His might that his arrows might go swift and far. Let your bending in the Archer&amp;rsquo;s hand be for gladness for even as he loves the arrows that flies so he also loves the bow that is stable.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are people of agenda in all relationships. We don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s pure love. When there is no attachment, love will blossom.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="6-ananda-vs-sukha-dukha-centered-in-the-center">6: ananda vs sukha dukha; centered in the center&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ananda is different from sukha. Sukha translated as pleasure has an opposite - pain. Opposites always go together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While the day is going on the night is getting ready. There is no abrupt change (black/white). You can never have one separate with the other. Even as you are enjoying pleasure you are creating pain. Hang-over effect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide whether you want timeless ananda or sukha-dukha. &lt;strong>Pain and pleasure are states of mind. During both the mind is turbulence (once up and once down). Stress created by hyperactivity of the mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t distinguish between pleasure and pain.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no wisdom, no pragmatism in seeking pleasure. It is just as painful as any pain. Go for on objects (of the world) independent ananda. It is yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t even try to be happy because you&amp;rsquo;re the happiness. If you do try, the effort = misery. Parable: sugar crystal trying to get sweet. In an effort to become happy you move from yourself and thus lose all happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be in the silence of the love = Shanti, Brahman, Iswara, prema &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secret of mahatmas good health is that their mind is mostly silent. They are not seeking any pleasures and thus abide in their svarupa. &lt;strong>Their mind is thus pure (=silent, calm).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Stop seeking pleasures of this world all-together. Avoid any effort to be happy.&lt;/strong> Just be. Happiness that comes by any effort is misery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pleasures makes us servile.&lt;/strong> As we cling to the things of the world - there is only trouble. No trouble means clinging to nothing. Give up all to gain all. Life becomes pure radiation of inner joy from an inexhaustible source of love and happiness. And the [world will appear like a dream (like the moon during daytime)]({% post_url 2019-09-14-Zorba_the_Greek %}).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The dream is not the problem, your desire to cling to it is. You have to stop imagining that this dream is real, that this dream is yours. Look at the dream as dream, refuse to give reality to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the utter folly in worldly and ritualistic actions aimed at fulfilling desires. Of having a blueprint (for happiness). &lt;strong>Suppose you don&amp;rsquo;t desire nothing you will not know what is trouble.&lt;/strong> Will generate fear in you and that makes you a slave of transient things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All fear we have is due to the sense of insufficiency. You&amp;rsquo;ve to know you&amp;rsquo;re the infinite ocean of bliss. &lt;strong>Get some viveka. You lack nothing. I don&amp;rsquo;t want any change to happen in what I&amp;rsquo;m now or in what I&amp;rsquo;ve now.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should not look at yourself as mere deha. Deha is healthy, not I&amp;rsquo;m healthy. Be careful even in the language not to identify with the body. 1) disidentify literally 2) disidentify emotionally, intellectually.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Falsehood makes you suffer, never the Truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Asmin dehe (in this body), I&amp;rsquo;m the dehi - the embodied. They belong to different orders of realities. The reflexion of the moon in the water is moving, but not the moon! &lt;strong>Body/mind is functioning (doing, thinking) but you remain changeless being&lt;/strong>, the center, the source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You know the atma by being the atma. Discover it and remain there and you discover your center in being. And then you develop a nag in remaining there even in acting. Start in small steps, like washing the dishes, the hands, taking a walk. First fix yourself in the being and then there is the movements of the hands, walking but you remain fixed in the being. This way you discover there is doing but I&amp;rsquo;m not the doer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People confuse thinking with being. Degree is intellect, not your being. Accomplishment (=action) is not your being. Your body is not your being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only rich people grow grass and cut it. Ordinary people have no time for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One is doer, one is body only by aviveka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dharma (here): merit you want to derive to gain heaven etc (heavenly currency). Give up the three: artha, kama, dharma. Once they are put aside there is no desire left.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spontaneity of love: not needing anything and worshipping Isvara, not knowing what is the purpose. I.e. desireless worship. Then you&amp;rsquo;ve reached the goal. Because the moment you see &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;result&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;benefit&amp;rdquo; is always mind-made. The moment you say purpose you&amp;rsquo;re engrossed in the movement of the mind. &lt;strong>Anything the mind wants has no value. Mind cannot conceive the real. Whatever it conceives/wants is not real.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water, sun, wind, earth, mountains, roses &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t seek a purpose.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Desire comes. If you are interested in it it will bind you. If not it will just go.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parable: king going to London. 1st wife wants diamonds, 2nd wants clothes. 3rd &amp;ldquo;I want you&amp;rdquo;. Worship Isvara like that and you&amp;rsquo;ll discover him as the atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever appears at the very first glance is not the truth. Like sun rising. Seeing differences (nama &amp;amp; rupa). Yet human consciousness is the same - fundamentally insecure and unsatisfied. Always look for the unity. One tree is growing because there is life in it. A different tree is growing because there is life in it. Yet it is the same life in every living being. That one life without the other is God, Atma, Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Legs - prthvivi, abdomen - water, tummy - fire, chest - vayu, neck and above - akasha. Mahabhuta - because they are everywhere. Entire universe is pervaded by them and they put the body in place, in which the atma houses. Because all bodies are made in the same way we can have medical science.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop identifying with the body and hold on to the hari and you&amp;rsquo;ll not know what is sorrow in life.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="7-one-reality-sharanagatih-love">7: one reality, sharanagatih, love&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re that divinity that you worship. Realising Isvara and realising one&amp;rsquo;s true essence is one and the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adhiyatma (individual - jiva), adhibhuta (world - jagat), adhidaiva (god - isvara) are &lt;strong>not three different realities, but thee different aspects of one reality&lt;/strong>. Brahman being looked at though different conditionings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is your vision about yourself will determine your vision about gods and the world. If you are conflicted within you&amp;rsquo;ll see conflict everywhere. There is so much love, peace in the world -&amp;gt; there is so much love in your heart, peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jiva is brahman, the supreme reality, reflecting in body mind + ignorance. Remove the ignorance and jiva alone will shine as Brahman. Pure crystal with different objects before - it gets &amp;ldquo;tainted&amp;rdquo; by them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People addicted to names will not know the truth. Vicious circle: one name leads to another and so on &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>When food is served, you don&amp;rsquo;t name any dish. All you likes and dislikes about food they fall apart.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The name binds you. Remove the name, remove the form and the reality shines forth. 12:00 - small needle merges in big needle. In the fullness of jnanam (12:00) the individual and godhead merge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m - sense of being. Knowing that I&amp;rsquo;m (not knowledge, book stuff). I&amp;rsquo;m-ness limited in space and time is jiva. Pure I&amp;rsquo;m-ness is brahman. Take brahman and put some limitations on it and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a jiva. How? Maya (magic)&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Individual and universe: Looking at the absolute brahman through the prism of space, time and causation -&amp;gt; limitation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In absolute there is no time. Thought is encased in time. Time is a category of thought. In the absolute there is also no motion. Because there is no other. Absolute is one without the second. Motion is movement of an object in reference to some other point. Causation begins only when the absolute is degenerated into the multitudinous universe. Don&amp;rsquo;t look at your self through the prism of space-time-causation or else you become the &amp;ldquo;caused&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMquExt5-M">Saranagatih&lt;/a> - allow Isvara to decide what is good for you. I surrender myself to Isvara. Whether I should marry or not, &amp;hellip;, Ishvara shall decide. Motiveless devotion.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankara: All devatas (angels) and asuras (daemons) are among humans only. Devatas - Hollywood stars. Asuras - suited people. Yaksha - finance people. Gandharva - dance and music people. Supreme Gandharva was Michael Jackson.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shaking hands vs. touching feet of a Guru: feet, because presiding deity for feet is Vishnu. For hands it is Indra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Touching feet or being devoted to the lotus feet of the lord means surrender - sharanagatih. Allow God into your (thought) life and then let go. Give up all concern. Accept what is and then maybe do something about it. But first accept so you can do effectively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resolution for the new year: We&amp;rsquo;re surrendering to to Isvara&amp;rsquo;s glory, and we do anticipate anything. We do not get concern about anything. We are letting go and accepting things as they come. -&amp;gt; You&amp;rsquo;ll not know what is insecurity and fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami TV: I suppose dvija-tvam (bar mitzvah, born again from Christianity) came by silk-route.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surrender to Isvara doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any demands. People can be in any state/stage of life. No qualification is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blemish in loving is desire. In love there is no desire (demand, expectation) involved. Then it is pure love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love - supreme power that makes the life free from conflict. Any other power cannot solve any conflict.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t cut the rose&amp;rdquo;. Stop purchasing 12 roses for 9.99 and the other will stop cutting. It&amp;rsquo;s a vicious circle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loving insentient object - moha. Different as seeing it as the glory of Isvara. Swami TV: I love leaves falling down not knowing where they fall. I love all lifeforms. &lt;strong>I love every particle of this universe. There is not what for.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you know you love Isvara yet you know not why you love Isvara then moksha is yours. Then you don&amp;rsquo;t need anything else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yogi - seeker, striver, devote, jnani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you rejoice people in happiness, when you feel sad when you feel people becoming sad - you&amp;rsquo;re a jogi. All sense of division are kept aside. Supreme devotion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is not multiple selves. In fact there is only one self for every lifeform. And that self is Isvara. True devotion is love of that Isvara - sarvaatma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vivekananda: Selflessness is the best way to secure what is good for you.&lt;/strong> People are selfish because they want the best things for them for the sake of their happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The only way to become happy is to give happiness to others. The moment you seek happiness for yourself you become miserable&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ekAnta (one end) bhakti: the means and the goal is one and the same. Love of Isvara for gaining Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="8-daityas-morality-isvara">8: daityas; morality; Isvara&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prahlada&amp;rsquo;s mind (buddhi) was firmy established (ekanta samsthitam) in Isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Single important cause of unhappiness of old people - body becomes old yet the mind is just as active as it used to be, not having any peace. -&amp;gt; comparison -&amp;gt; jealousy manifested by complaints, remembering and glorifying the past.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goal of life: knowing oneself. Knowing what you are before the body falls. Is the same as motiveless devotion to Isvara. Bhakti = jnanam. Prahlada&amp;rsquo;s mind is set on this goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diti is dvaityam, duality. Adity - non-duality. Children of Adity are devatas - wise people. Children of Diti are asuras - worldly, arrogant, big ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:vega = momentum. sa:kopavega - momentum of anger. kamavega or kamavesha. Entire physiology gets affected. Outwardly and inwardly. It is like a daemon has possessed the guy. There is an asura sitting in everybody.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prahlada is not even trying to defend himself. If you react the other finds justification for his anger, but if you do not react and just accept it with love, with smile&lt;/strong>, the other won&amp;rsquo;t find justification for this anger. Acceptance - that is how a Jnani is. He can just smile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People feel hurt - it shows they are ignorant. Then people justify their hurt. Pragmatical would be just to forgive&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Petty tyrant) &lt;strong>If somebody says something against you, it can be only against the ego once you identify with your mind. You can be happy about it and join with the other. Because ego is not yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social morality wants you to be ambitious, competitive, progressive, easily hurt and reacting. It wants you to pursue wealth, pleasures and family. Social morality has its origin in ignorance. &lt;strong>Real morality - you&amp;rsquo;re not competitive, you do not compare with others, you do not get hurt but are instead always loving and compassionate. You don&amp;rsquo;t speak much. Society might look at such a person as a dumb guy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Follow the truth. If father, brother, husband &amp;hellip; come in the way renounce them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is one power behind small and big, behind everything. There is no enemy because the same unknown universal power is behind all. It is the unknown power acting, you&amp;rsquo;re imagining you&amp;rsquo;re acting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arrogant person thinks he controls a lot, others might think they control a bit. In fact we&amp;rsquo;re like patients under anesthetics when a surgeon is performing surgery on them. The patient has no power whatsoever. We just imagine. Everything happens to us. You don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice. You&amp;rsquo;ve got an illusion of a choice. In our folly we think we&amp;rsquo;re accomplishing things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara is the power of time. Everything happens in time. (&amp;ldquo;For everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven.&amp;rdquo; - Ecclesiastes). He creates, protects and destroy. It is all the same power.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intelligence - sattva power of Isvara. When you understand the structure of the atom that is the intelligence in the atom you&amp;rsquo;ve understood.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once we&amp;rsquo;re after pleasures any amount of wealth is not enough. When you&amp;rsquo;re desiring you&amp;rsquo;re bound to have enemies as others desire the same. That leads to anger -&amp;gt; daemon. There are no friends and foes, there is only divinity. Yet people seek and imagine. Don&amp;rsquo;t split yourself into the opposites. Establish yourself in the sameness (samatvam).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conquer your body. Body says go sit on the couch, yet you say and sit straight. Body says, eat more, you say this is enough. Conquer your mind. If you don&amp;rsquo;t that body and mind will become your enemies. Enemy = one who makes you uncomfortable, suffer and miserable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Past-time of the ignorant mind - divide and oppose.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Great puja of infinite Isvara - samatvam (= greatest worship). Not having friends and foes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya - the six enemies are like termites in the heart. Eating up his vitals of life and wisdom, his peace of mind. The person is collecting and thinking I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished this and that&amp;hellip; So think first of conquering your inner enemies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Saddarshanam - Swami TV</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-05-08-saddarshanam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2020-05-08-saddarshanam/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNo9o6Ea9wo&amp;amp;list=PLd6RYR-zr5hFrUOtobrmrkNZKNAMNJb86">source classes&lt;/a>&lt;br>
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzg2Wd1xJS4">source satsang&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1--2-seeing-exploration-vs-accumulation">1 &amp;amp; 2: Seeing. Exploration vs. Accumulation&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Outward simplicity with inward fragmentary thinking (caste, creed, lingam&amp;hellip;) -&amp;gt; obstacle to the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If mind is the origin, it isn&amp;rsquo;t truth, only concept/idea.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Products of the hand (objects) and of the mind (ideas) have taken over our reality. Give up all of those.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(3) Always open, always learning, no conclusion. &lt;strong>Conclusion means the truth is truncated, no longer infinite.&lt;/strong> Mahatmas do not arrive at conclusions. Atma has infinite expressions. Suddenly you come across a new person who presents a new facet of the infinite. &lt;strong>There is only exploration. When you conclude about atma you miss the whole thing.&lt;/strong> In Vedanta there are no conclusions, this is a journey without a goal. Timeless journey in a partless land without a goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knowing is dangerous, it makes you a person who believes &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo;. Knowledge accumulates. If something accumulates it is not the truth. Therefore seeing the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In learning there is freedom. In knowing, there is accumulation.&lt;/strong> Knowing is measuring. Learning like a putting finger in the fire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Satyam is what you understand. Sat is what is. Advaita: Sat and Cit is one and the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(1) &lt;strong>What IS is the truth.&lt;/strong> The beauty of truth is that it is very simple. To find/understand what is you must be a very simple person. When you make truth complex, you remain away from it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do you have preferences while looking (image in the mind, looking at the thing through the image)? Do you name it (is it not an image in your mind)? You don&amp;rsquo;t know how to look.&lt;/strong> Division - mind thinks object of the world are different.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(2) &lt;strong>When you look at something through the image in the mind you position yourself the knower -&amp;gt; Division.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re looking more with your mind than with your eye. You&amp;rsquo;re looking at the present through the images of the past - you kill the present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The eyes become a conduit for the inner light. There is only looking.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="3--4-sat">3 &amp;amp; 4: sat&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You do not cognise the pot, you cognise the existence of the pot.&lt;/strong> The existence conditioned by the name of name and form of the pot. The absolute existence you cannot cognise, it is not available for senses/mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pot is not born from clay, it is born from your mind. It is born, when the pot-thought happened.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>It is not the pot that is but the ISness in the form of the pot. The substantive is the ISness. Demonstration: closed eyes + touch -&amp;gt; perception of ISness, and mind will supply the image (nama and rupa), that which is not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Can there be a thing without the knowledge of the thing? There is a thing called &amp;ldquo;atom of uranium&amp;rdquo; only after people discovered uranium.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a thing called world only because of the light (cit) in you. Vedanta: arrive at, discover this &amp;ldquo;light within you&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Light&amp;rdquo; of knowingness, awareness, due to which you are aware. Without this light there are no cognitions of sat (we&amp;rsquo;ve just dropped the name, rupa). And this inner light (cit) IS (sat) = Paramatma = the one being, because of which your world is put in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dealing with unintelligent people: if people take nama rupa too seriously, they cannot be taught Vedanta. &lt;strong>Do namaskara, apologise, wish luck and walk away.&lt;/strong> How can you satisfy them&amp;hellip;? If you don&amp;rsquo;t like metaphors, you cannot be taugt Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re jealous because you compare yourself with somebody else.&lt;/strong> Probably since high school. Definition of a parent: he/she handles his entire ajnana to you. Why are you a hindu? Because your parents were &amp;hellip; (all this are images only, not real).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;There is&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;sense of being&amp;rdquo; (sensing of existence) - outer. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; - sense of being - inner. Both are &amp;ldquo;sense of being&amp;rdquo; (sense, cognition, chetana). Existence as we normally understand it is jada - unsentient - which is not possible without chetana. Sense of being that shines as the knowing. No separation. Both jiva and jagat have their origin in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="5--6-hrd---harati-dukham">5 &amp;amp; 6: hrd - harati dukham&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vishnuh (means &amp;ldquo;allpervading&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/strong> - allpervading light - sat. Everywhere (space) is sat, always (time) is sat. Everything (objects) is sat. It is the mind that divides.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For a student of Vedanta, Vishnuh is in in the heart (feeling, living), not in the mind (memory - repetition - conditioning, thoughts - rupa, nama).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You seek happiness but you end up with sorrow -&amp;gt; Maya. We want to live but we fall dead -&amp;gt; Maya. Somebody wants to die but he lives -&amp;gt; Maya &amp;hellip; Maya is the explanation for the inexplicable. All contradictions, paradoxes of life can be explained only by one word - Maya. That&amp;rsquo;s how the infinite is located in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are born as &amp;ldquo;heart&amp;rdquo; people but grow into head people. Language (nama), thoughts (rupa). Ramana Maharsi -&amp;gt; come down from the head to the heart. Discover the truth (sat) that is in our heart. Stop searching outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is too much thinking, the quality of thinking suffers. Hyperactivity of the mind has become a disease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever you plan is samsara. Whatever happens, is God.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thought process breeds sorrow and fear. You have a health issue only because your thought-process is messed up. &amp;ldquo;Love your enemy&amp;rdquo; (bless him) is the best thing for good health. Forgive others for their transgressions so that god will forgive me for mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An impure mind is hyperactive, like a disturbed bee hive. A pure mind is calm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sit straight up, close your eyes and samsara is over. God is here in spite of you (person).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hrd - harati (avert) dukham (sorrow). If you don&amp;rsquo;t remain there, you&amp;rsquo;ll be in the mind (generator of sorrow). Sruti never speaks of sin (papa), only about dukham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fearlessness is godliness, desireless is godliness. Desire covers your svarupa. It makes you a beggar at the door of the useless, unreal world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The right kind of religion should make you full, fearless. That is the meaning of hrd, haraha, hari, hrim.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Head is the world. Heart is the ishvara. There is no other world - your conception of the world is the world. And you&amp;rsquo;re roaming in that world, not doing any good for yourself. He&amp;rsquo;s saying this and that about you &amp;hellip; God bless him and you move to your heart. I&amp;rsquo;m older, he&amp;rsquo;s supposed to respect me -&amp;gt; god bless him &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>World - linguistic (nama), observational (rupa), but not existential (sat). Advise the mind (mind addressing the mind, it works): oh, foolish mind, mind enjoy the bhagavan in the heart, don&amp;rsquo;t go out to the world seeking him. Slowly your personality will obtain a new dimension.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Those who discover god in their heart are called rishis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your heart is the center of the cosmos. What you call cosmos is presence - chetana. When you feel joy, you feel it in the heart. You experience sat as chit only in the heart. GhaTa is sat. GhaTajnanam is in the heart. GhaTa doesn&amp;rsquo;t have existence without knowledge of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As child you were innocent. Then you became cunning, crafty, manipulative (Prometheus). Undertake the spiritual journey - reverse journey - (Odysseus) back to the heart and lose all those qualities of the head. &lt;strong>Understand there is nothing to lose in this world.&lt;/strong> A poet said: child is the father of the man.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should be simple and single.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Child-like not childish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If they exploit you, let them exploit you. And enjoy!&lt;/strong> There is nothing to lose.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>For ease you don&amp;rsquo;t need a reason. Sat, fearlessness is your svarupa. Uneasiness needs a reason.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children have the same amount of problems but they are somehow invisible connected to the sat. In a matter of second they can put them away and play. We became people of the head and lost the connect (Průša Connect).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go back to your heart. If you need the mind it will come. Like a camera that goes up on a cellphone. Truth, love should command your life. Not the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="7--8-mind-and-its-silence-no-future">7 &amp;amp; 8: mind and its silence; no future&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Natural state of the mind is silence, not thinking. Like natural state of the body is healthy body. That&amp;rsquo;s the goal - mind reverting back to it natural state once an experience passes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramana Maharshi: You don&amp;rsquo;t want to run behind the running mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation: 1) &lt;strong>watch the mind, the movement of the mind - movement of the waking consciousness.&lt;/strong> Here is the greed, here is the identification with body, status, role. This is the ambitions, conflicts &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t judge, don&amp;rsquo;t condemn.&lt;/strong> The moment you want it, it becomes slow, without your effort.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>All that needs doing can be done slowly. When the mind is quiet, the strength to do work will come, the right motive will come.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t peek into the future. Don&amp;rsquo;t try. There is no animal called (psychological) &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo; in this creation of God.&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;Along with this anxiety I&amp;rsquo;m surrendering the future to you Isvara&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>If somebody is right about the future - coincidence.&lt;/strong> And he will make a system of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Stop seeking. It is a very bad habit that we constantly seek something&lt;/strong> from somebody. Many people think &amp;ldquo;1) please god 2) get something for it&amp;rdquo;. God doesn&amp;rsquo;t work like that. The infallible is the god. Love. In love, there is no seeking. In attachment there is. Seeking breeds conflict. Trading &amp;ldquo;favours&amp;rdquo;, expectations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have patience. Take your time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need erstnenness, fortitude. Don&amp;rsquo;t lose heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation: 2) then remain in silence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Journey has a goal only when there is a journeyer. If there is no journeyer, there is no &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; left. This is a journey without a goal.&lt;/strong> That &amp;ldquo;inner&amp;rdquo; reality will take you in. Like river merging in the ocean.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To recollect something/someone, to meditate upon it there must be a division.&lt;/strong> If you me meditate say upon god, can it be real or only conceptual? The real comes into being only when thought ceases - thought no longer creates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the talk is substantial, the crowd will be small. Crowds want entertainment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The real cannot be object of thought. It is unknown and unknowable. Paradox: &lt;strong>the unknown would become known if it could be thought of.&lt;/strong> Here the name can help. Thinking of the name (of the God) will prevent thinking of the world which will allow the real to arise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhaktas prepare in a way that he is sure he need not and he should not understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Thought moves from the known to known only. And what is known is not real.&lt;/strong> What is known is in time. Real is timeless. Thought means time, if there is no thought you have no time (like in sleep, meditation). Once a thing is called in the net of time it cannot be real anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The misfortune of vedanta students is that they don&amp;rsquo;t remain students. They are in a big hurry to become acharyas. &lt;strong>You have to remain student till the last breath. Never become an acharya, be a simple soul. Suppose you say &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo; and look into you consciousness -&amp;gt; the mind is moving.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can you say &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know?&amp;rdquo; It is the most truthful statement you can ever make.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot invite the truth. To invite it, you must stand apart from it.&lt;/strong> The moment you stand apart from it it is not truth any more. To know truth is to deny the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In action, in living, where there is no small, seeking self, the truth can be found. Truth is found in an action that is inspired by desirelessness. That&amp;rsquo;s why desirelessness is godliness. There is truth in dharmic, non-violent life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;d not induce, enforce, impose the silence. Allow the silence to take over. Like sleep - it takes you in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; you are asserting your reality. Mind acting like a whale.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="9--10-one-without-the-second-smaranam-aneya-nistha">9 &amp;amp; 10: one without the second. smaranam. aneya. nistha.&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ekam. One without the second. No division. It pervades all. Like space or gold =&amp;gt; many ornaments. Child (Brahman) playing with a mirror (Maya) - when it breaks his friends multiply.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identifying with the body induces you to no end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karma - mechanical.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aprameyaya namah. Ameyaya namah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>mana - to measure. I see the pot = seeing, knowing, limiting. Measuring = limiting in time, space and form.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever is limited in space is limited in space also. It was born and it will die.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PramAna (pra + mana) = means of knowing. Knowing is measuring, limiting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What all you know gets dropped. Your mind is alert. Empty, not blacked. Alert - ready to learn/know. That&amp;rsquo;s why you listen to a speaker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma is the knowingness in which there is no knowing. There is no second to know. The sun doesn&amp;rsquo;t illuminate nothing around itself - because there is nothing around itself (Gn 1:3?). Maya has to come into the picture to convert the not-knowing knowingness into a mechanical process of knowing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pramana can be reduced to two categories: pratyaksha (knowing primarily through the senses - mind is there too). Anumana (you know primarily with the mind). The pramanas only help you to know the limited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are waiting for happiness. Are they waiting for happiness or for death? Knowledge will never happen in future (there is just waiting to know).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as the desire to know will persist, you will not know. Just like in sleep - as long as the desire to sleep persists you are not sleeping. It should drop, the effort, the one who makes the effort should drop. Everything should drop and then there is sleep. Atmajnanam is like that.&lt;/strong> Suppose you know atma than it&amp;rsquo;s like: &amp;ldquo;Are you sleeping? Yes I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m what I&amp;rsquo;m but I want to know atma - schism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Draw the boundary so you don&amp;rsquo;t depend on a limited means of knowledge to know the unlimited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aham is known to you. Is it known to you by speech? Is it known to you by eyesight? Is it known to you through thought (like ghaTa)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;d have the ability to learn from suggestive hints. Shastra says &amp;ldquo;aprameyah&amp;rdquo; for atman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All that comes from mind and senses - all science = aparavidya, avidya. Atma is outside of categories. Knowledge oscillates between two states: known -&amp;gt; unknown. unseen (avidita) -&amp;gt; seen (vidita). &lt;strong>Atma - outside of this classification. Atma is the drg! Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for atma to become known from unknown.&lt;/strong> Some questions don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer. &amp;ldquo;Did the sun rise? I don&amp;rsquo;t know because it is very dark outside. Fool, take the lamp and go see outside!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GhaTa - pramanasiddha. Atma - svayamsiddha. Not even veda/sruti is the pramana for atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pramana is used to know a thing that is not known. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with atma. Do you know you are?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is nothing like knowing atma. Atma is not perceivable, not conceivable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the effort is dropped atma reveals itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Self-knowledge - knowledge of all what you are not. And that is what sastra is good for.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negative understanding is the highest understanding. Know atma as ameya - that which is not measurable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>smarah - recollection. Thinking about (meditating on). &lt;strong>Acintana eva brahma cintana. Look at the mind, watch it, allow it to become quiet. Once the mind becomes no mind you become one with the brahman. Like a wave reducing its amplitude until it becomes one with the ocean.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not mine. Drop mine. Use Bhagavan&amp;rsquo;s. Ultimative addition - now I want to put atma into the &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is a contradiction to say I know the truth because whatever is known cannot be the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you induce the silence - yogic samadhi - you&amp;rsquo;re separate and the silence is separate. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the one who created silence&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; Are you conscious about yourself being silent (fullness), then you&amp;rsquo;re not silent. When you are you&amp;rsquo;ve created the other. The fullness/silence becomes the other.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmasmruti is not like recollecting brahma/atma/isvara as the other. Here it is merging. Also it is called nishta.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="11--12-continuity-vs-presence">11 &amp;amp; 12: continuity vs. presence&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>light of awareness illuminates the mental space.&lt;/strong> Ask yourself what is this &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo;? Instead of being preoccupied with the objects that appear in the light.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot substitute enquiry done by yourself with some ritual (mechanical). Be self-reliant. &lt;strong>Help yourself and the higher power will help you as well.&lt;/strong> If you hand over to some other person (guru) it is not going to work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Continuous means time. Awareness is outside of it. Also beyond categories pure / impure. It is homogeneous, uninterrupted, monolithic, immutable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything is changing. Mind - the knower. The known - objects. Only the light is not changing. Illuminating witness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hurricane: lightning and thunderstorm all around. But it is calm in the eye of the hurricane.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That light gives existence to the mind and the mind gives existence to the body and the world. That is the God, Bhagavan, Ishvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To know it is to be it. Abiding in it. Nistha (abidance).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the motive is not compatible with vedantic learning, give up the ritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any rituals. Sadhana means qualifications, not ritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vayragya: don&amp;rsquo;t abide in pleasures, better avoid them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Viveka: Don&amp;rsquo;t glorify the body. Don&amp;rsquo;t identify with the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Treat body like a machine. Keep it clean, healthy and ignore it. So you can live mostly beyond the body-consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmajnanam - total dissolution of the person. That &lt;strong>person it not real. It is entirely a construct of the ignorant mind.&lt;/strong> Nishta: be a pure, calm witness to that person, not the person. Just be. Can you? As long as you remain as the pure being the obsession to do something (what next?) is gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prakrstam (magnificent, great) krtihi (creation, making) = prakuruti&lt;/strong>. Just doing. There is no krti in Purusha (atma).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In being, there is no time. In doing, there is. There must be movement for time. In being there is no &amp;ldquo;What next&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as you are speaking, bhagavan won&amp;rsquo;t. Just be (silent).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind should not be obsessed with doing this, that, planing. It should learn that there is the pure, immutable awareness behind it and it should respect it. Then it keeps quiet.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bhakti is jnanam. Love and understanding in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All accumulation ends in disintegration (death). Death is written all over. Fear of death is because of desire for continuity. Name, family, business. You write on stone on the grave - because of desire for continuity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t have children? You are blessed&amp;hellip; But people want both, continue family tree and atmajnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Death cannot do anything to the present. But death can break the myth of continuity.&lt;/strong> Only when the mind is caught in the net of continuity there is the fear of death.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="13--14-death-surrender-control-and-responsibility">13 &amp;amp; 14: death, surrender (control and responsibility)&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We generally take a thing for real. Mind needs to learn that the body is a living process, not a thing. So the mind can think of it differently and be calm. This living process is integration, rest and disintegration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In death only the body dies, not the life, not the consciousness, not the reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you sorrowful? Then you are deluded. That&amp;rsquo;s all the matters in the Gita up to the 2nd chapter 10th verse. Only then Gita really starts with saying that people who grief over death are muddy headed people and people who know don&amp;rsquo;t grief.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the bulb is fused it is the witness of it who says it is getting fused, not the bulb. Similarly with the death of the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should stop giving undue importance to death and abandon the illusion that we are body and mind. So death is allowed to become part of living. There is death all around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inhale - life, exhale - death. Existence consists of both. Don&amp;rsquo;t separate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Death - fear of unknown? We don&amp;rsquo;t know what was before birth and what will come after death. Religion system has sown misinformation into the society about what comes before/after.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge is not traditional, knowledge is timeless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fear of death comes from the projected loss of the known.&lt;/strong> You lose everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t own anything. You came simple, single, naked, not owning anything. You go like that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about god and the time before he was known? -&amp;gt; has birth -&amp;gt; has death -&amp;gt; is limited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>god - idea created out of fear of death (seeing oneself as limited jiva) as that which is big, powerful, knowledgeable, deathless, etc. Swami Vivekananda: God is which the ideal. Ideal is always connected to the actual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thinker vs. follower (has introjected other&amp;rsquo;s idea).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Juliet: &amp;ldquo;What is there in a name&amp;rdquo;. The rose by whatever name you call it smells sweet. Take the spirit of it&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Surrender (saranagati) is not a ritual but understanding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First you have to do saranagati, then worry about advaita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Surrender - think, contemplate of the one mover behind everything and then leave everything to him.&lt;/strong> That is courage, strength of mind, bhakti. If there is hesitation, that&amp;rsquo;s the jiva. The insecure ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saranagati is the shortest route to self realisation. It itself is the liberation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stand without desire and fear. Desire implies you&amp;rsquo;ve not surrendered. Fear implies you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to surrender. &lt;strong>Relinquish all control and responsibility (don&amp;rsquo;t confuse with duty). Karma is duty. Phala is responsibility.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teaching is the duty. Checking if they have learned is responsibility. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to control situations, people. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel responsible - if you do, you&amp;rsquo;re playing god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sri Ramakrishna: relinquishing all control and responsibility = Divine Madness. But then only mad (not crazy) people can create history&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personal control is not a fact, it is only an idea in your head. Same for responsibility.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do not give up duty. Duty is not personal, it makes you impersonal. Give up personal control and responsibility.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spiritual beliefs are based on lack of proper understanding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When personal control and personal responsibility are gone a new life dawns. Life becomes full of love and there is beauty in self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watch your daily life and see how little surrender you have in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ritual = checklist (done).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ritualized reverence comes in the way of learning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you surrender first a thing dies. The &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;, the me which is the anchor for all fears and desires.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="15--16-death-of-me-sense-living-without-periphery-and-center">15 &amp;amp; 16: death of me-sense. Living without periphery and center.&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Once the illusion that I&amp;rsquo;m body mind is gone death becomes part of living. The purpose of the fear of death is to surrender.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahatma is dead to the world (world = very self centric, ego-centric lifestyle). He&amp;rsquo;s death to the past, he lives in the present. &lt;strong>If a person he had bad experience which comes before him, he deals with it as if nothing ever happened. Every day for him is fresh and cheerful.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only rituals born out of the greed of the devotees and priestcraft should be abandoned.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surrender is not a ritual, it is understanding that there is one (prime) mover outside and inside. Shiva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extravagant humanisation problem: converting gods into humans (w. place of being, marriage, children, marital fights&amp;hellip;) instead of finding god in you. Steer clear of these elements of popular religions. Follow vedantic religion where the act of understanding is a religious act.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You create &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;-sense witch is very artificial and unreal. Described often as egocentric, self-centric, hot-headed, arrogant in people. Without center there is no circle and without circle there is no center. &lt;strong>Me-sense is the center, mine-sense is the circle. Example: spool/spindle of string. You are that unreal center. Only the space is real that is all-over. That circle is your prison.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;My&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; exploitation. -&amp;gt; Putting above.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In sleep the center and the circle is not there. There is so much joy. You are one with the infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People take the house as the boundary of love. I love my children, wife, parents, religion, my garden, rose from my garden&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swamiji: I listen and keep quiet, don&amp;rsquo;t say anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When the center (aham-matih) is there, you&amp;rsquo;ve created (your limited) space. And with space you create time. -&amp;gt; bubble, cocoon of consciousness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dismantling: My religion -&amp;gt; entire humanity is my religion. Na matah, na janma, na dharma &amp;hellip; &lt;strong>My house -&amp;gt; a house. My body -&amp;gt; a body.&lt;/strong> Living the live with tremendous vigor. This is the glory of self-surrender.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understanding: everything happens because of the will of the higher power. There is no mine, there is no me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can we live without desires? &lt;strong>Without groceries you can&amp;rsquo;t live. Without desires you can.&lt;/strong> Funny fact: with all the groceries and desires you live a miserable live in-spite of the first due to the later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Model: I&amp;rsquo;m asking the question and you pose it to yourself. You investigate. And don&amp;rsquo;t be in a hurry, don&amp;rsquo;t ask others for the answer, ask yourself. Worst model: I&amp;rsquo;m the teacher and you are the students. Then any learning stops.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Center is creating space and time. A method (how to surrender) belongs to time. And the truth is timeless. Method is no good. You must be able to see it. Like there is no end to the sorrow. But seeing the meaninglessness of the sorrow it stops. &lt;strong>In seeing psychological time is not created, there is no time. In doing, there is time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>My caste&amp;hellip; How do you know it is your caste? Ask yourself. Second-hand thing &amp;hellip; Tell me one thing about you that is not second hand.&lt;/strong> More than &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; (sat) which includes that &amp;ldquo;I know that I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; (cit) all is second hand labels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask: What do you mean by &amp;ldquo;my caste?&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re all human beings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without periphery the center goes too. Unwind the periphery (me, mine) and tremendous vitality comes into your life.&lt;/strong> And you revert to your natural state (to &amp;ldquo;tat tvam asi&amp;rdquo;, divinity, deathlessness). Gita says &amp;ldquo;nirmamo nirahamkarah sa santim adhigatchati&amp;rdquo; (BG 2.71) and the teaching is over.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Every single time you dismantle the &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; you grow. Alert mind is required.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is death all around, there is no death for you. Your father did not die. The body died. What is your father? The body or the consciousness. If he is the body you killed him - you burned/buried the body. What kind of consciousness was your father? Human consciousness. There is the same in you, me, all over. That did not die, the glory of it is everywhere. When the bulb fuses nothing happens to the grid. That&amp;rsquo;s why Krishna says &amp;ldquo;death is an impossibility, nobody has ever died, nobody can ever die&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedantic class initial question: What are you? A physical entity (go home)? An emotional entity (you are disturbed and will disturb the guru as well? Go home)? An intellectual entity (go home)? An spiritual entity? Death and life is one for spiritual entity. No difference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Egoity: identified with memory, property, ideas&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why do you celebrate birth? Because it is your birth &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the game. You&amp;rsquo;re not part of Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Somebody said something unpleasant to you. Are you not hurt? Answer: I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about it. What is it in the consciousness that got hurt? The ego, the center. Let it get hurt. It deserves.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let the ego die, the earlier the better. You&amp;rsquo;re deathless. You&amp;rsquo;re not concerned about birth any more. You never again condemn death. Death is the acharya of vedanta (kathaupanishad)! &lt;strong>Only the Lord of Death can impart the knowledge because only he knows the self&lt;/strong> (Jesus and crucifixion). Understand the significance of that and be the Lord of Death. Tat tvam asi.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="17-higher-power-and-personal-order">17: higher power and personal order&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Two people are quarreling. Which party do you join? Neither. Both are talking something out of the head.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t interfere, rise above those kinds of opposites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birthless = timeless&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddha was atmaavadi. Buddhists &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Higher power - the moment you bring in &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; you bring in duality. Duality is obstacle to bhakti. Because in duality you want to remain yourself as separate entity. Separateness is selfishness, not bhakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There are two natural orders in your life. Personal and predictable - you decide what you&amp;rsquo;ll do (have coffee for breakfast, attend class &amp;hellip;). Supra-personal. You purchase a ticket but the flight gets canceled because the fog is too strong. God. Higher nature. As the understanding grows, the supra-natural grows and personal diminishes. Once there is only supra-personal such person is called bhakta, jnani.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Illusion of the personal order (control, volition). &lt;strong>The unknown and unknowable higher power acts and you image you&amp;rsquo;re acting. You&amp;rsquo;re not acting.&lt;/strong> So much is done upon you, nothing is done by you. You were made to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can you wonder? Do you ask yourself &amp;ldquo;how come&amp;rdquo;? If not, go sit on the tree. You only collect words to create mental structures. That is not vedanta, that&amp;rsquo;s devanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything is done by that mysterious power (American Beauty). Mysterious - you cannot describe it, you cannot imagine its glory. It creates everything. It moves everything. &lt;strong>Bhakti: realize you&amp;rsquo;re not the mover, the doer. You&amp;rsquo;re the watcher. Realize that and you&amp;rsquo;ll be at peace. Jnanam: that power is not separate from you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scientist is a dispassionate observer. There is no &amp;ldquo;I want this result&amp;rdquo; in it, no trading with god. Remain a dispassionate observer and a wonder arises in your heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to wonder cannot be a devotee.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wonder is bhakti. Not naming. Once you name it, the wonder is gone.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Higher power is real. Its output - jagat and aham - is not, it only appears, otherwise there is duality. They&amp;rsquo;re one and the same (Trinity).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Snake illusion: The rope must be there. The light must be there, but not enough. Knowing that there is a thing called serpent in the world. You must also know that the serpent resembles the rope. Only then you can see serpent where it is not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Higher power not only creates - he&amp;rsquo;s not extra-cosmic. He&amp;rsquo;s antarjami. He creates and moves.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="18--19-light-and-the-moving-picture">18 &amp;amp; 19: light and the moving picture&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>God need not be a matter of faith. Can be a matter of understanding. External principles posed by tradition convert an understanding into belief. In belief the mind is crippled, mechanical, stops functioning. In understanding there is exploration - you try to find out for yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>True religion - realizing of God. Like a scientist. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t prejudge what he is going to find. He explores with an open mind. In belief, you prejudge.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Desire to know the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vishvam = Jagat = calana citram = calana citram.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you call world is but a collection of memories. Jagat is a succession of mental states. Maya - what is inside (of you - body / mind) is projected outside. Just like in a dream. Dreamer and the world are contained in the dream consciousness. The same consciousness appears as the subject and object.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Projection = serpent that is in the mind is projected on the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you wake up the movie called Jagat begins.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All you have to do: see the dream as a dream. The dream vanishes - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother you anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>World - very glittering (jagat!) and empty show. It appears, it is not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once you lose interest in the world it just vanishes. Like in quantum physics: the thing is there as long as you are observing it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chetana (light) cannot be transformative cause of the jagat. Only jadah can be. The light remains what it is yet it makes the scenes appear on the screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cause-effect model works only for transformations. Time is very important &amp;hellip; so give up cause-effect model. The model vedantins love is drg-drshya model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jagat is relative to the sense organs and the mind. When they are not functional the experience of the world comes to an end. Therefore &lt;strong>sense organs and the mind = seer, jagat = experienced (seen).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you see it, it is there. When you don&amp;rsquo;t, it is not. When you take part (interest - positive and negative) in it, it appears real. Quantum mechanics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PIE: en:to look ~ sa:loka. Therefore what you look at is loka. Bhuloka, Svargaloka, Vishnuloka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What perceives is the atma? No - mind only. But the mind must be illuminated by the light of consciousness. &lt;strong>The mind, being very subtle and pure captures the reflection of atma and becomes the subject. Yet mind and matter are of the same stuff - jadah.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Film analogy. Lense focuses the light. &lt;strong>Film is the moving mind. Lense + film is the subject. Scenes on the screen - jagat. Only one thing is missing.&lt;/strong> Like in a flight where plane, stewards, passangers everything is ready only the pilot is not there&amp;hellip; The light is missing. &lt;strong>Prakaashah - the light of awareness. Screen is the canvas of space time.&lt;/strong> Can you have an object without space? When you say an object you cannot separate the object from the space. It is the object in space given the shape by the space. Once space comes, time comes. Space time is continuum. Like nama and rupa. Desha kala provides the screen, canvas, the here and now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The scenes continuously changing constitute what is called phenomenal world. Moving mind and the sense organs constitute the subject.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lense - light focused in a particular way. Therefore lense is light only. Light passes through the film and gets conditioned by the imprints in it. Before entering the film, it is light, after it emerges from it it is still light only. Light appearing as the scenes on the screen - hero / heroes on the screen - all are light only (their essence is light only). Screen is also light only. Everything is light and light and light. Nothing else is there. What about you? You&amp;rsquo;re absorbed in the movie.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Everything is light but light is none of them. This is the maya. The magic of the show. When you look at everything you have to see the one light in all.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re part of the show by being attached by good/bad (desire/fear). In the process you miss the real. Failure to see the one is cause of the samsara, bondage.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the light side when you come to the all you have to see the same light in all. From the all side you should be able to negate the all (there is nothing in light, only appearance. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick to brahma, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect brahma).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When is the creation? Today morning is the creation. The window of the mind is slowly opening. Light of the sun of atma is slowly coming in. Now all what is there in the mind comes to the light. Mental states start to shine in the light of atma. One success the other, as mind is not a static thing - it still moves. When there is movement, you get space and time. You cannot have space and time without movement. The resulting experience is called the world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever we talk of the Brahman you can apply to yourself. Brahman is appreciated based on the understanding of yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is nothing wrong with the world, with the show. The problem is with the way you look at the world. Jnani is the one who doesn&amp;rsquo;t throw flowers at the cinema screen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without imagination (=projection) there is no world, no serpent. Your conviction that you see the world is the world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You see a mountain in a dream. Its essence is dream consciousness. You see a mountain in the movie, its essence is light. What is the essence of the mountain you see in the waking state? Waking consciousness - light reflected through the lense (of the mind).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you call matter is consciousness. What you call mind is waking consciousness - which appears as both object and subject. They come and vanish together. When you go to sleep there is neither. Both have the same origin, the pure light(cit), pure being (sat) in which there is boundless peace (ananda) when you abide in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramarshi is not a in a hurry to give name and form. He says sah (because prakasha is pumlinga), ekah. &lt;strong>Give a name - weakness of the mind.&lt;/strong> Leave it open, open-ended.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="20--21-examining-clearly">20 &amp;amp; 21: examining clearly&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Seeing - knowledge - understanding. Information can be anything. While being body/mind how can it be I&amp;rsquo;m aware of body/mind all the time?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birthday? How can you say? It&amp;rsquo;s a label of the body and that thing was 75 years ago. Not each year. Invitation: should say? All of you come and look at this body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Siddhanta - conclusion. &lt;strong>Mata - opinion. Mata is used also for &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; in the south. North calls religion dharma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Popular religion vs. true religion. The later should help the masses to look at the religion they are practising.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t answer any question. Let the question incubate. Don&amp;rsquo;t be in a hurry to answer.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How come this religion came into my life? India: We believe the way we do because my granddad, father believed so. Nothing bad with starting the life with a belief. But investigate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Examine the belief. Religion as belief divides people.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In true religion the Truth is the god. And it&amp;rsquo;s all-inclusive. There is no real division.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ceremonies and celebrations. Are they religions?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All religions are pursing the same, the nomenclature differs and they fight. All religions proclaim a triangle, the vertices being:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Jiva (individual - like indivisional - self, &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; only provisionally). Jiva is that principle which keeps all the sense organs and the mind together. Prana. No reason to see it separately from the cosmic power. Like electricity powering this bulb is not different from the electricity in the national grid. It is only apparently a separate entity. Don&amp;rsquo;t convert to a person with a birth and death or you create one more hurdle.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Paratma. The supreme self. Every religion calls it differently (to obscure the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; connection). When you say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; the huge hurdle of &amp;ldquo;body/mind&amp;rdquo; is there - identification with the body/mind. Because of this identification another term another term for that cosmic reality was needed - Paramatma. &amp;ldquo;Pure ghee&amp;rdquo; is needed in a society that adulterates everything. Actually you don&amp;rsquo;t need para. Atma is good enough.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should rise about fragmentary thinking. &lt;strong>We have to look into the movement of the consciousness and then examine every element of fragmentary thinking.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Candidate for Vedanta is mahushya (human being). Not conditioned to be a citizen of &amp;hellip;, devotee of a certain religion &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aham-matih (me-sense) in you is which makes you think fragmentarily. (me - crooked like m. vs. straight I).&lt;/strong> Examine that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="22--23-religion-vs-spirituality-me-sense-the-triad-and-their-dissolution">22 &amp;amp; 23: religion vs. spirituality; me-sense, the triad and their dissolution&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Abrahamic faiths: world is real, god is extra-cosmic. God sentient, the individual (the person) sentient. World is dead matter (no soul, no life in it). Plants dead matter. Animals not dead yet, but they don&amp;rsquo;t have a soul.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life begins with religion. But it should not end with religion. Vivekananda: nothing wrong in taking birth in a temple. It is wrong to die in a temple.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;re born in to religion. We should grow into spirituality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religions are organised. Spirituality is organisationless. It is individual, not a group thing. It is formless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no society outside of you. The individual encompasses the family, community, society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You want to bring a change into a family? The change you bring first into you, because you include the family.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No matter how many students are around, spirituality always starts with two. It is 1:1 first - guru and shishya. But it gets merged into one later. Thus individual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion objective in its approach. God, the real is objective. Spirituality is subjective, focus on the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Word traditional is religious in content, not vedantic. Vedanta is evolutionary: animal-man -&amp;gt; normal-man -&amp;gt; super-man -&amp;gt; divine-man. Inner transformation is highlighted, not the time (tradition) content. &lt;strong>Not traditional, transformational.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aham brahman asmi. You begin with the isolated (due to ignorance; divided) &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; and explore it. That emerges as brahman. asmi, not bhavisyami, because it is timeless. &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; is the seed, God is tree.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Traditional - frozen thought.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion being a belief is exclusive. Spirituality is inclusive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The movement of the mind is like a tram car in religion. A tram doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a driver. No thinking is required. That&amp;rsquo;s how it has to be done. Things stands where they stand. Critiquing, not criticising.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spirituality is change of heart. Egoism is replaced by divinity. Spiritual experience is what matters. You experience the other person as your self. A tree as your existence&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion is founded on fear. Spirituality is founded on love. Not knowledge. Not intellectualism. Yet some vedantic people engage in a lot of intellectual gymnastics - hair splitters. &amp;hellip; What difference it makes?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The triad - jiva, jagat, parambrahma - is only relevant as long as the &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;-sense persists. They have the same duration.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Me-sense: like a cylinder (body like) made out of thread of habits and idiosyncrasies.&lt;/strong> But you cannot divide space. Space has no parts (so it is able to contain other objects with parts). Just like the self. &amp;hellip; false entity, fantom, shadow of the real. Although only a shadow the glory of the real persists in it. The &amp;ldquo;me sense&amp;rdquo; happens also to be a being, knowing, bliss-experiencing entity because they are connected (image).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as you identify with the shadow-self so long you&amp;rsquo;ll suffer in life. Nobody suffers because of the real, only because of the falsehood.&lt;/strong> Everybody but a few mahatmas are suffering. Intellectuals are the toughest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The me-sense parades as the subject, even though it is the object of your witnessing. Objectify it (falsify it)! And you cease to fret and worry. If there is no me-sense nobody can hurt you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In falsehood (me-sense) there is psychological security. In truth there is no psychological security.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>me-sense is not a single entity (then it would be as good as real). It is a composite. It is the sum total, thread of memories&lt;/strong> (Castaneda: recapitulation - unwinding).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Content of the mind = memories. Mind is memory, past. Thoughtlessness is present, not mindlessness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You wake up and the mind becomes illuminated. Illuminated by knowingness - becomes known. The past that is known takes the shape of a person. Me-sense comes into being. This is the first delusion (original sin). Why it takes the shape because of a person - because of habit. Where is the first delusion? There is none - it is anadi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more you you examine the person the more it falls apart.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t need the me-sense. To have a cup of coffee you need a cup of coffee, not the me-sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The me-sense kicks in only when you&amp;rsquo;re self-conscious. E.g. I&amp;rsquo;m an acharya! Self-consciousness = I&amp;rsquo;m the doer.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In religion, in the (whole) world nobody will tell you that the me-sense is false. &lt;strong>Religion fixes the me-sense in you. The god who created the world and your relation to that god is essential essential for the me-sense.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In waking state, are you self-conscious always? Be aware of what&amp;rsquo;s happening, not thinking of what you are (not).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Humans need to laugh (hAsya). In that short time they are free from the me-sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you&amp;rsquo;re not self-conscious are you a person? You&amp;rsquo;re not (you &amp;ldquo;are&amp;rdquo; what you know - what you think of). But you&amp;rsquo;re there! To be a person you need memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Who are you without memory?! You certainly exist&amp;hellip; Except that I feel that I exist what else can you say about you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In between, in the gaps of the memory, you&amp;rsquo;re impersonal existence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Me, the dualistic god and the world rise and sink together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose you stand desireless and fearless the me-sense will not be there. The god-sense will not be there as well. &lt;strong>When you are desireless and fearless you don&amp;rsquo;t recollect yourself as a person nor you need to think of god.&lt;/strong> Only when there are desires and/or fears which put the me-sense strongly in place there is a god to reward/punish. Otherwise only fullness remains.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="24--25---aham-matih-shunya-nistha">24 &amp;amp; 25 - aham matih shunya nistha&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Jiva - living entity. Pranadharane - functions are there. Prana governs both action (creator - create - karma = action) and knowing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jagat - phenomenal world. Changeful. Annectode: 100 letters, one manages to reply 2-3 -&amp;gt; &lt;strong>Silence is the best reply. World is like that - the more you pay attention to it, the more real it will seem.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Isvara - boss. Higher power (Ish-). Ideal derived from your own self (knowing, being, happy). The ideal you&amp;rsquo;re worshipping is your most inner self. Just stop superimposing body and mind on your self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re not a tiny guy. Your body is a tiny guy, limited in space. Learn to live the body alone. &lt;strong>Body is space, mind is time. When you take space and time upon yourself, you become a thing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religious identity in India began around 4-5th century. If all the pots are blue, there will be no blue pot. Just pot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>True religion should help us to experience directly the true reality behind all of names and forms. There will be peace and cheerfulness. By giving up the me-sense (1. vayragya, 2. viveka) you&amp;rsquo;ve reached home.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m an acharya! Picture of me in the foreground and Shankara in the background. Do away with it. Do I need it to take a class?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose you want to love your wife, or work in the office. Is egoity needed? Do away with the ego and devote yourself to the work you have to do. Do you duty there and do not look for result.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami TV: there is racism in India, all kinds of divisions. But not in America.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami TV: I don&amp;rsquo;t do teachings in temple (out of respect; wrong place for Vedanta). I keep quit there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Essence of true religion is change of heart. Transmutation. Replace egoity with divinity (love). Replace selfishness with selflessness. As long as you are the ego the divinity is the other and is away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beliefs associated with birth and death are popular religion, not vedanta. I was not born, you were not born, nobody was. I will not die, you will not die, nobody dies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as the religion serves the ego it remains perverted and useless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Aham matih shunya nistha&amp;rdquo; is true religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to make any effort for the nistha. Just see to it that the &amp;ldquo;aham matih&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t dominate and mess up the life.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listen with open mind. Do you want the speaker to confirm what you already know?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aham matih - I want to be come something other than what I&amp;rsquo;m. I have an opinion about what I&amp;rsquo;m and I&amp;rsquo;m unhappy with myself.&lt;/strong> Brahmacari is not happy that he is not married. The married guy is not happy that he&amp;rsquo;s not been promoted yet. The promoted guy is unhappy that he is not millionaire yet&amp;hellip; The guy is unhappy that is not a father. The swami is not happy that he&amp;rsquo;s not a bigger acharya&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why there is so much struggle in life? Because the life as we know it is endless process of becoming &lt;strong>(Samsara). Moving (focus) from what is to what is not.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s how the ego is playing the game.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is virtue in being, not in becoming. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to become anything. I&amp;rsquo;m what I&amp;rsquo;m. It is better to know what I&amp;rsquo;m than struggling to become what I&amp;rsquo;m not. It is better to use what I have than struggle to acquire what I have not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Being is recognising what is.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Target - what is, is not satisfactory. (target - sin - christianity?). Bhagavan Buddha was always walking. But he never walked to reach a goal.&lt;/strong> By making a goal you focus on becoming, future, not what is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In nistha you realise what is. Then accept what is. Beauty of marriage is accepting the weakness of the other. Live with what is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Illness. &lt;strong>First you welcome it and stay with it.&lt;/strong> In resisting it you do yourself no service &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s OK. It&amp;rsquo;s a guest - atitih devo bhava. It&amp;rsquo;s not about wanting or not wanting. Welcome everything. &lt;strong>And then befriend it. Then if it&amp;rsquo;s becoming a problem in life then deal with it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Always &amp;ldquo;what next&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; - game of the aham-matih.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Instead of becoming, can I (just) be?&lt;/strong> In being there is the radical transformation in you. It&amp;rsquo;s not a stale state, it&amp;rsquo;s the most powerful state. Being is everything, ever with you. You need not search for it, it&amp;rsquo;s ever with you. You need not struggle for it. That&amp;rsquo;s the God.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="satsang-2020-05-12">Satsang 2020-05-12&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>Why are you listening to Vedanta? Do you want confirmation of your thinking? Then listening has no meaning at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discovery is only possible in a light, open, curious mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Concentration is exclusion.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t concentrate. Just sit very quietly without fixing attention on anything. Mind is very quiet, really still. You hear everything. There is no choice in it, if it were it is concentration. Mind is not directed, focused through a channel, but open. There is ease, no strain is involved. There is only listening, you as a person are not there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can listen to the silence also.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You &lt;strong>don&amp;rsquo;t name anything. This kind of listening is called shravanam. People don&amp;rsquo;t know how to listen, they know only how to hear. Even when they are listening, they are hearing a person.&lt;/strong> When sishya is listening to the guru there is no listening (importance is paid to persons).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya: reality reveals itself to you. You don&amp;rsquo;t invite it. &lt;strong>Water takes care of the thirst, you have no role to play there, your role is just sipping the water.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the clock ticking. The sound of ticking is revealing itself to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shankaracarya: shravana manana niddidhiasanam should become one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When consciousness is empty, it is spacious. Not directed to a channel. In such consciousness discovery happens. In such consciousness shravanam mananam niddidhiasanam is one.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listen to Vedanta by putting aside all the paraphernalia of guru, sampradaya, etc. Something will happen in your consciousness without you seek for it, without you wanting it. The truth will reveal itself to you. This is real shravanam. Just listening, professional shravanam, won&amp;rsquo;t help you. Volume (amount) is also not important.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Buddha: spiritual emancipation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do Upanishads a particular God to be worshipped? No.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The other is all negation&lt;/strong> in the Upanishads. Nothing specific. Buddha doesn&amp;rsquo;t say nothing specific about the other either. BG 12th chapter there are 20 verses, 19 of them speak about &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; end and only one about &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo; end. And this one line is all negation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I cannot say anything about god. To know god is to deny god. God is unknown and unknowable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The other end is kept open.&lt;/strong> Convergent series vs. divergent series (the other). Convergent series goes towards a result. &lt;strong>Convergent is particular, time-bound, unreal.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t prejudge god. You have to discover it. And when you do, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover that the world that you think is before you is a mere appearance. It is not real. And also you&amp;rsquo;ll discover that you don&amp;rsquo;t stand apart from th real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should the chick inside the egg speculate (judge) about how it will be outside of the egg or should it break the shell and liberate itself from the bondage?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inspiration by Pujaswami. &lt;strong>The one who causes obstacles and creates problems, we should bless that person. The setback, difficulty, sorrow etc. caused we have to receive as the will of the higher power - Isvara.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ivwara is not the other end. It belongs to &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; end.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People pay lip-service to that Krishna say and in their hearts they do what they want. This is how people are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The other end is avyayam (imperishable).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is easy to come around an American, Indian etc. but not around a human being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advaita is not an intellectual affair, it is something felt deeply, as one&amp;rsquo;s being is felt in the heart.&lt;/li>

Melodias que elevam, sopram ventos de mudança&lt;br>
Baterias carrego com poemas de confiança&lt;br>
Desliga a mente, viaja velozmente até ao âmago&lt;br>

&lt;h2 id="part-1httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtgqz9uw0buk">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGqz9uW0Buk">Part 1&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>samsara = worldliness = bondage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>cognitive knowledge &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; accumulated knowledge (intellect - in braincells) &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; jnanam as satyam jnanam anantam brahman (intelligence; all-pervading truth)&lt;/strong>. All are called jnanam even though different in nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intelligence is not limited to the braincells only. In is in the braincells but not of the braincells. Intellectual knowledge is in the braincells and of the braincells.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jiva becomes Shiva by jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are wise you appreciate the speaker if he is abolishing what you know. If otherwise, you want confirmation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human mind becomes mechanical because it is burdened with machinery of knowledge. Truth doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into the machinery of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intelligence comes when you free the mind (constantly) from accumulation.&lt;/strong> Unless you make mind free of accumulation of the known there cannot be discovery (even in science). What you know keep aside and watch with open, empty (not blank) mind. Then you discover.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shankara: jnanam is darshana. Seeing is learning.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whenever you&amp;rsquo;ve learned something, your mind was empty (silent).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anything associated with the cultivation of memory is traditional. Therefore (in) time. &lt;strong>Timeless cannot be approached keeping the time in tact.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s why you never get there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Beginning of intelligence is when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to put aside all the known.&lt;/strong> That intelligence helps you to see the truth of yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma, Brahman, Rama, Krisha, Truth &amp;hellip; is fresh/new all the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Information = knowledge. Most of the time we gather information therefore the mind never gets quiet.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Surrendering to a belief (school, society) doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the human problem. What you need is not a label, tradition, accumulated knowledge (that&amp;rsquo;s needed for a profession). Here you need a free mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your heart, digestive system &amp;hellip; is functioning well because intelligence is operating in your heart. The moment you introduce your intellect it will start misbehaving. Why your mind is not able to discover the truth?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intelligence is operating everywhere except in the mind because the mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow it to take over. It is not ready to become fresh,&lt;/strong> shed its categorizations, identities &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Truth is not traditional. Truth is timeless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Human being is the starting point of the discovery&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are looking for submission, conformity, not discovery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An intelligent mind is a mind which is not satisfied with conclusions. -&amp;gt; no discovery. If you are satisfied will there be search and will there be discovery in your life?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Belief is just another form of conclusion. Same for dos and donts. &lt;strong>An intelligent mind is an enquiring, watching and learning mind&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is intelligence only when there is no fear.&lt;/strong> Religions of the world put fear in the mind. When you use word tradition it comes with a very subtle fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Knowledge has anchorage, intelligence is not attached to something. It comes into being when you understand the total process (of your own mind - if you want to discover your self). If you do it comes forth and helps you. You need not study a single book if you understand your mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You know it - you command it, that&amp;rsquo;s how it works with the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your mind is all. It is entire humanity. It contains the entire evolutional history of the mankind, of the past&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Examine yourself in relationship with the people, physical things around you.&lt;/strong>. How do you relate with Isvara? &lt;strong>Understanding of the self is understanding the self in its relation with the others&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tattvabodha is additive, conceptual book. Bhajagovindam is pure experience speaking. The way the poet thinks and feels. Bhajagovindam is (a book) of intelligence. Tattvabodha is conceptual collection of information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intellect (knowledge) you can acquire from outside, intelligence not. Intelligence comes when it is not hindered by knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the moment of discovery the other (guru, scripture, you the person, &amp;hellip;) is not there. All the structures are put aside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There must be a revolt against your own mind that hold you back. It believes in structures that the mind created for itself, where the mind finds some gratification&lt;/strong>. All the time you&amp;rsquo;re seeking gratification of the mind. There is no fear, it is replaced by the love of truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A heart which loves the truth cannot entertain fear. They don&amp;rsquo;t go together.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The intensity with which you believe shows how much insecure you are&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By the time you define intelligence it becomes intellect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jnanam is intelligence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmavantam = manovantam (of excellent, pure of inadvertence mind). Atma can be satchitananda, body, mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind can be a hindrance into intelligence or can flower into intelligence (atmavantam). If you &lt;strong>keep it buoyant, cheerful, fearless, not anxious and not hurried (don&amp;rsquo;t try to accomplish too many things at the same time - do one thing at a time). And keep the body moving.&lt;/strong> If it is too convenient you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like get up, you don&amp;rsquo;t get up and finally you can&amp;rsquo;t get up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the name of religion people accumulate a lot of fear (superstitions)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If fear or anxiety takes up your mind get aware of it. Don&amp;rsquo;t use prayers, after the prayer the fear is less or strengthened? Suppose I wear a talisman because I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of an evil spirit. Is it a proof of my fearlessness or fear? Pray with love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sakA - the one who likes the company. bhakta - the one who love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you feel a bit down, get up on your feet, don&amp;rsquo;t sit on a sofa, go into open air. Walk briskly. Slowly means low feelings has taken you over. Breathe deeply the cold air, the cold air that caresses your face - it will cheer you up. If it is time not to go out, stand in the corner and open the mouth, take air in fully and exhale through nostrils while bending without bending the knees. And feel that the universal Vayu you&amp;rsquo;re taking it. Walk alone chanting OM. Feel oneness with all. Try to rise above petty cares and anxieties.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="satsanghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhbn8l3cptd0">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbn8L3CPtd0">Satsang&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The question of freewill (a term not found in Indian scriptures) is because we jump between two levels. &lt;strong>Freewill is karta/bhokta&lt;/strong> that comes when you wrongly identify with the ksethra. It is not your nature. You are the presence, and in that situation you&amp;rsquo;re not the karta/bhokta therefore you do not have freewill. You are the purusha and the question of freewill doesn&amp;rsquo;t even arise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children are born intelligence and once the intellect takes over intelligence takes back seat. We have to bring it out one more time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Role of the guru: the pointing finger. He tries to help the student see his own nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Telling of puranic stories to children will be useful only if you understand them. Adopt highly symbolic stories or one with good message. Heroic ones, ones with a moral message, stories of great struggle (like creation of state Israel). Those who inspire. Don&amp;rsquo;t tell stories that make superstitious. Majority of the stories are useless. Pancha-tantra stories - good ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Animals know that they exist (satchit - I&amp;rsquo;m and I know that I&amp;rsquo;m) and have some basic identity. Dog befriends dogs not cats. Even a plant knows it exists (sat-chit).&lt;/strong> All are atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When doing work be totally immersed in it. That itself is meditation - karmasamadhi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmajoti: when you look at the body only there is body. If you look at the mind only there is mind. Otherwise you alone are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Q&amp;amp;A can come from &lt;strong>srsti-drsti-vada (&amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; multiplicity) or drsti-srsti-vada (you yourself alone are)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Madhyamarga: Bhagavan Buddha&amp;rsquo;s central teaching is moderation. As thought before by Krishna. &lt;strong>Moderation is extremely important, going to extremes is very wrong. Middle-path is the natural and spontanious path. You get it by losing the struggle to get middle-path.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sat has no levels. There is only paramarthika sat - brahma. pratibhatikam (no sat added) - jagat, vyavaharikam (no sat again) - jagat. Swami TV: I prefer not to say &amp;ldquo;sat&amp;rdquo; at all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are not greedy, not ambitious, totally devoted to your work, patient there is &lt;strong>no need to promote yourself (or work)&lt;/strong>. The results will start running after you by themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For sanyasa lifestyle India is the optimal place.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Karma by its very nature binds. Good action = golden shackles. Bad action = iron shackles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Understand that prosperity or adversity, all is because of my actions from before.&lt;/strong> Instead we blame others, external agents. Man is the one who molds his own destiny.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you seek a result, the thing you do is not important anymore. It is the result. Learn to love the thing you do.&lt;/strong> There will be no hindrances, no frustration. Such a person will be able to create something original.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Find out what is the incentive behind your action. &lt;strong>If my objective is a result I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with what I am and/or what I have. That means I&amp;rsquo;ve an ambition&lt;/strong>. All the energies are spent on the ambition (phala) in which case the inward feeling of love for the action will be missing. In doing so people are getting frustrated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ambition -&amp;gt; acting through the narrow funnel of me/mine. Action without ambition is a creative action.&lt;/strong> Ambition kills creativeness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddha (not anatmavadi, but non-ego-vadi): &lt;strong>truth is, when the me and mine is not there.&lt;/strong> Brahmanirvanam - satcitananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pray without seeking anything. There is pure love in it. It becomes upasana - that inner feeling. That feeling will take you to the oneness with Iswara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as there is a motive in your action, there will be distortion.&lt;/strong> It is not creative. You&amp;rsquo;re likely to be frustrated (because the result might not come).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Karmayoga - action without ambition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is not enough to just do the action. You must also think. What is this action? Why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are three issues with every action. Bhoktrtvam (mine). Kartrtvam (me). Akartrtva (I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it attitude; opposite of kartrtvam).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nature works. Human being acts.&lt;/strong> Work is by the nature for the nature. Human act is based either on desire or fear or both. He longs to possess and enjoy. Or is afraid of pain and/or death. That&amp;rsquo;s why he&amp;rsquo;s doing his actions. River is working, human is acting. River doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow out of personal desire or fear. &lt;strong>Entire nature is working without a sense of me.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you the actor or are you the presence who is aware of the action?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You cannot do anything for self-realization. No need to climb the mountains or sit in the cave. Just be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Always the deed is first. Then comes the doer. Example: Seeing happens. And then you come and say &amp;ldquo;I see&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong> The dream happens. You claim you yourself have seen the dream - &amp;ldquo;it is my dream&amp;rdquo;. First is teaching, then there is teacher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People mistake doing and being. Fan is doing the rotating. Not the electricity. It is just present. Body/mind is the instrument, you&amp;rsquo;re the spirit. The spirit never acts. There is no doership in the spirit. Higher power is acting (Prime Mover is moving), I&amp;rsquo;m just a witness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For realization, action is incidental, understanding is essential. Actions happen. I do not act.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Yoga - me and mine is given up&lt;/strong>. Yoga sanyasta karmanam. Such a person is not bound by the actions.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="part-2httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv1qvo868dwga">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qvo868dwgA">Part 2&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Not bound by karmas = not afflicted by sorrow. Liberated from the bondage of samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Examine, what is the jnana, karma doing for you?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you look at the guru, is he free from the samsara?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is negative way. As you understand the ajnana, you get free of it and come to jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk of love will be all negative. Once you know what is not love you come to what is called love. Same for jnanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When people are ignorant of the true self they are given to egoity - selfishness. Their palaces become worse than jails, worse than graves, worse than hells. They have all kinds of petty cares, low-sorted desires. They forge their own chains (karmani). Example: silkworm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignorance is a bed of thorns. As long as you are steeped in ignorance you&amp;rsquo;ll not be able what is called freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignorant people pursue worldly pleasures. &lt;strong>Sensuous pleasures are like narcotics for temporary relief&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jnanam is renouncing the temptations of the world. Becoming dead to the world.&lt;/strong> Not going out of the world. That is not possible anyway.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rituals, celebrations, ceremonies create a lot of excitement in people. Then worries come, finally sorrow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ve to be brave to throw off a yoke. People are essentially superstitious. They want to follow, not to think. &lt;strong>You need bravery that comes out of clarity of the thinking.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the social and community life you should not entertain the ideas of revenge, punishment, jealousy, antagonism&amp;hellip; That is the ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ghatajnanam is not knowledge. It is ignorance. It is cognition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you call knowledge is information and memory. This way vedanta-knowledge will never work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tradition is cultivation of memory.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In pursuit of self knowledge - guiding the human being inwardly, tradition as accumulation of memory will not help.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To discover the truth about yourself you need an open, empty mind. A mind free of accumulation. Otherwise it will be just recycling the accumulation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind uses the knowledge as psychological safeguard.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help in discovering the truth of yourself, God. &lt;strong>When the mind is open, the intellect takes rest and creative intelligence in it starts operating.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;ll realise you&amp;rsquo;re not the actor. This realization will not accumulate, it is a learning that is very fresh and in this learning you&amp;rsquo;ll know your svarupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="satsang-2020-12-19httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv85ig0s_7bbs">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85IG0S_7Bbs">Satsang 2020-12-19&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Satsang: examining the issues of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Am I the slave of the body or am I the master of the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shift from wordliness into spiritual life should be slow and steady. It is not about the time element.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever might be the worldly accomplishment it has two qualities - it is transient and it is superficial (makes your mind excited).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Final achievement - realising the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purity results in quietness of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma is inward, world is outwards, the mind is in between. &lt;strong>Mind is the meeting place between matter and spirit.&lt;/strong> You choose where the focus is. Are you bahirmukha or are you antarmukha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the mind becomes quit you enter into the unknown and unknowable world. A world without images, words, waves of memory. A world of love, where there is death every minute, full of beauty not created by human thought.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where there is death there is renewal of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The known is memory, the content of the mind. It is the known that binds us.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation: in spite of all that you&amp;rsquo;re aware of get hold the dimension in you where nothing happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You created all your vasanas, you are able to get rid of them. You have to address, lecture yourself. People are used to lecture others instead&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buddha: by holding on to antagonism you cannot solve the problem of antagonism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is jealousy? Understand that it is there only when you compare yourself to others. This is a habit from childhood. Why should I compare with others? &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m what I&amp;rsquo;m, I will try not to compare with others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Learning, understanding is not a process. You do not collect understanding peace by peace. Understanding, learning is instant, timeless. It&amp;rsquo;s like ripening a fruit: it takes a lot of time to get ripe, but it falls suddenly.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atmajnanam has nothing to do accumulation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Chinmayo&amp;rsquo;ham: Remind yourself for 5 minutes that you&amp;rsquo;re the awareness, not the changing body/world. This will help you overcome the sense of doership. You do not anything, things happen. You are not digesting, you are not pumping the blood, you are not reading.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Science and Vedanta are not dipoles, there is no common ground like magnetism for polar poles. They are complementary. Science is the study of names and forms, of the ephemeral universa. Spirituality is the study of the changeless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>True pilgrimage: inner pilgrimage. You&amp;rsquo;re aware of the body/mind but now you have to find that inner being in which there is no movement.&lt;/strong> Unless you dismiss the outgoing attitude you will not be able to make the inner pilgrimage. &lt;strong>Isvara is out there is dvaita. Isvara in my heart is the first step. Last step tat tvam asi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="bhagavad-gita-chapter-4-verse-41httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0sdfcul1zrw-giving-up-desire-for-the-result">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SDFcuL1zRw">Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4 Verse 41&lt;/a> (giving up desire for the result)&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All karma originates in thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where do you put emphasis? In organised religion the focus is on the superficial action, not on the motive behind it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Krishna: you cannot entirely give up the actions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Here giving up is not physically actions, it is giving up by understanding. In the form of vision of the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nobody desires karma, only karmaphala. Desire for karmaphala creates the actor. Action directly doesn&amp;rsquo;t create the actor.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Result of teaching is dakshina or compensation. Not that you understand. I speak in a way that you understand. &lt;strong>There is no phalam in the karma. Phalam (is what) comes later.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the speaker loves the job, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t desire anything out of it. There is no actor now. &lt;strong>Desire for the result binds binds the actor to his action.&lt;/strong> Action is not binding if there is no desire behind it. He just loves it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Desire for the action is because you want to become &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong> - process of becoming. Through rituals. Poor man has no time for rituals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This process of becoming is strife, pain, struggle&lt;/strong>. This is the bondage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If I don&amp;rsquo;t desire to become anything than I&amp;rsquo;m already what I&amp;rsquo;m. The infinite being comes to the foreground.&lt;/strong> This is moksha. By giving up the becoming you arrive at the being.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paramartha darshana: action is there but no struggle to become. Samsara, bondage of karma ends. Another name for paramartha darshana is yoga.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How to understand celebrations and festivals from advaita perspective? We avoid them. They are attempts to escape from the sorrow of life. As long as you do escape from life, you do not understand (problems) of life. Students of Vedanta would prefer solitude, study, contemplation and meditation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Science and Vedanta should guide your life. Not (religious) superstitions.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Golden era of India 200BC - 500AD. Since then downfall until 1895 when Swami Vivekananda addressed the parlament of religions. Since then Hindu renaissance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All prayers come from self-pity. Fear of sin as well (abrahamic contribution?).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How come an uneducated person can know all that? The fact that one gets surprised shows that one&amp;rsquo;s conditioning is betrayed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The single message: &lt;strong>find out your self by inquiring into yourself and be self-reliant.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmakaravrti: silent mind merging into brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There are no things happening in Prakuruti until you know them. There is no galaxy until you see one. We do not accept existence without knowledge.&lt;/strong> Things happen only when you know. Until then they don&amp;rsquo;t happen. There is no &amp;ldquo;three days back&amp;rdquo; until you think of &amp;ldquo;three days back&amp;rdquo;. Until the cancer is detected it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. &lt;strong>Knowing is everything.&lt;/strong> Cancer is there only when it is detected (known). Do you have cancer when it is not detected? Once the cancer is detected people get anxious and that accelerates its growth.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Seeker of the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sraddha = ripeness of heart and mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Symptoms of the (samsara) disease: fear and sorrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Light of awareness I cannot show to you. You have to see it yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Doubting nature vs. questioning nature. Effort to scuttle vs. effort to know.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People have anxiety about possessions and relationships but don&amp;rsquo;t acquire discontent to know the truth. It is replace by complacency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whenever you&amp;rsquo;ve given a name to yourself or to your pursuit, the name is such a maya and will cover the truth. Avoid the naming business.&lt;/strong> They are very enticing, binding &amp;hellip; just go for the truth, knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the desire for truth is associated with some other desires, it becomes a tremendous distraction. Desire for the truth is your working capital. Use it and it will pay rich dividends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Life is nothing but seeking. Sraddha is when all other seeking ends. And there remains only one seeking, i.e. seeking of the truth. This is (the spirit of) sanyasa.&lt;/strong> Family people have some notion that they have to seek few other things as well. Otherwise life will come to standstill, we&amp;rsquo;ll become beggars or unhappy people. We seek the truth 1x a week in the Gita class otherwise we seek other things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the seeking becomes single pointed the truth will appear before you. It neither comes nor goes. It timelessly is. Only the right seeking is needed. That&amp;rsquo;s why you&amp;rsquo;re missing it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you seek with undivided attention only the seeking will remain, the seeker will dissolve. No more Hanuman seeking for Sita, but just the search. The search is the truth, the ultimate, the timeless reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hanuman must perform the search correctly. Whatever comes across and is not Sita, it has to be put aside (mentally)&lt;/strong>. &lt;strong>Search is all negative. It is refusal of the unreal&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The search for the reality itself becomes the movement of reality&lt;/strong>. What is real? Setting away the unreal!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make the truth, the real, yourself, guru, the god your inner guru. The day they are seen as one you&amp;rsquo;ve found the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Source of I&amp;rsquo;m, the unknown and unknowable foundation of your life experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Have a simple life and allow the instruments you posses to be put to good use by the higher will.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus should be on the inner guru.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schism: search in me, truth is in the books, guru in building, god is in the temple, atma in the heart &amp;hellip; as long as this division persist and you act accordingly you&amp;rsquo;re creating the element of time into timeless reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:sham -&amp;gt; shantihi, shama. sa:dam -&amp;gt; danda, dama. Quietude (related to the mind), control (related to the sense organs).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sense-organs and mind create a veil. In some very thick, in some medium, in some very thin. If the screen is very thick vedanta will not be useful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion keeps you bahirmukha. Instead of looking around they tell you to look up. Only chance is to come around antarmukha teaching/vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Consistently put the person aside (your own, guru). Otherwise it will take over.&lt;/strong> Focus on the teaching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Center
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Center is ego. If I&amp;rsquo;m a teacher, I&amp;rsquo;ll be watching the other teacher how he is teaching (to compare the centers).&lt;/strong> Not this kind of watching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watching, in which there is no watcher, no center, and no jealousy etc. will raise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice first with the outside, weather, birds-in-flight - what you have no attachment with. Watching will be happening and there will be center. Grow into it. Now apply that to a human relation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To like or dislike, there must be center. Without center, there is only watching and understanding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now come to the inner. Now &lt;strong>watch the movement of thought. How it is creating a life for you. A cocoon&lt;/strong>, a dome, a cell. Sitting in a cell your view will be very narrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You now understand that inner equipment. You get a very good leverage over the equipment. You are a free person. This is the great job of awareness. This is niddidhiasanam. What happened is meditation has become some futile pursuit of imagined goals and visions. It is a degradation of the very discipline.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can only say one thing about the real I. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I is&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I be&amp;rdquo;. All other is done body or mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t need a solution for sorrow. Sorrow is in place because of ignorance.&lt;/strong> Sorrow is in the equipment. Be aware of the sorrow and trace it&amp;rsquo;s cause.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody grieves over death. People grieve over attachment to the person that died.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Things like suffering, sorrow, thinking, notions, ideas, feelings persist only because you have not given full attention to them&lt;/strong>. Inadvertence. Because of inadvertence they are there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vyakta: whatever is known to the senses of mind. Sleep experiences is not cognised by any of the two, that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s avyakta. sa:avyakta -&amp;gt; undifferentiated (unmanifest).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you identify with the equipment, due to habit (another name for ignorance), a person is created.&lt;/strong> The name of such individual is vyakti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at movement of thoughts and how it is building an enclosure for you. &lt;strong>Thought is divisive and concave in the sense of including some and excluding everything else&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Psychology did not find a link between the human mind and phases of the moon. &lt;strong>Even though there is no connection when you believe there is a connection it appears to you that there is a connection. Solution to that problem is right understanding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The purpose of this classes (vedanta) is to establish harmony. &lt;strong>Harmony is divinity. Whatever is the sentiment of the other person in your relationship, go by love and harmony. Not by reciprocity.&lt;/strong> In a relationship, harmony must be the foundation. You forgive. You ignore the missteps of the other person. Then the relation will blossom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equipment must be put to action. If it is idle, it will become sick.&lt;/strong> Work, not for the center, but for others (for loka sangraha).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Harmony is you. It is you. Mind is the other. Mind is equipment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Those who say self-knowledge is in the future they themselves are ignorant of the self. &lt;strong>Self-knowledge is now. You&amp;rsquo;re the self. You need not to know about yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you know yourself correctly, thought stops creating fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you know yourself your relationships with people and with the world will be in good shape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sa:sraddha = intensive enthusiasm for truth&lt;/strong>. Hold the truth and nourish the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:srad = truth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sa:dha = contain and nourish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do you go about finding anything? Keep your mind (intellect) and heart (love) in it. Intellectually and emotionally you&amp;rsquo;re with it and then you find it. Same way you have to be devoted, then you come to realize.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sraddha: there must be interest, love, steady application of mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you convert the devotion into a ritual you will lose devotion&lt;/strong>. In sraddha there is no place for ritualized reverence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Test for sraddha: steady remembrance of the right thing at the right time&lt;/strong>. To remember what needs to be remembered is the secret to success.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Power of attention: somebody insults you. You investigate, who is getting insulted. Body, ears &amp;hellip; can&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;strong>You remember and realize and then there will be insult but you will not feel the insult.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sraddha: earnestness, steadfastness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PIE -&amp;gt; Vedic sanskrit -&amp;gt; sanskrit of Gita. PIE -&amp;gt; Latin -&amp;gt; English.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever is particular, I&amp;rsquo;m not. I&amp;rsquo;m the non-particular, impersonal, pure light. Remind yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The knowledge of self happens in peace and silence. Not in celebrational context.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life your life in natural way but always alert and watchful. Everything happens because of the higher power.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sraddha is the vision.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have sraddha in the vision of sastra is bound to perish in the sense of spiritual death - you believe you&amp;rsquo;re going to die and the everybody else believes you&amp;rsquo;re death. Spirit has no death!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sraddhavan labhate jnanam. &lt;strong>Those who cultivate the sraddha are sure gain the truth and liberation, because it is with you all the time.&lt;/strong> (Matthew 28:20)&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Daydreaming
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>people have this habit, because they don&amp;rsquo;t accept existing things / situations as they are. Mind develops a kind of an addiction to its own imaginations - you feel good in daydreaming. Work on it, &lt;strong>work on acceptance of the situation, of your lot.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation: watch the past as it flows into the present and creates &lt;strong>sorrow. Guilt, sense of failure etc. happen only because of past visiting the present. Solution: be observant.&lt;/strong> Control doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Have patience, don&amp;rsquo;t be in a hurry.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reincarnation doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist for atma. For it to happen, atma must die first. The topic of &lt;strong>reincarnation applies only to shadow/egoic/body-mind self.&lt;/strong> And that is not real. If you want to remain in mithya, there will be reincarnation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mistreatment:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When the other is mistreating you, it is not judgemental from you too see it as offensive behaviour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the moment when you are mistreated become attentive, &lt;strong>pay full attention to the insult. You will not feel insulted - when there is full attention there is no thought. Insult is a product of thought. Then remove yourself from the situation. And then from a distance bless the person&lt;/strong> - may god give him/her happiness. Insulting is done by his/her upadhi - sick mind. Atma is the same. Take precaution not to put ourself in the way of the person so it can repeat the insult. Cut off every possible contact with the person and keep that way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no family, there is no friend. You&amp;rsquo;re just imagining.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paying back insult with insult doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. The other will laugh at you because he could provoke you. Getting provoked is a reward to the insulting person.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reincarnate of XYZ - could mean that the person is as great of XYZ.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A jnani doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear like a jnani. He appears like a mUrkha. He conducts himself in the world like dumb guy. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t give display to his jnanam. Outwardly there is no difference between jnani and ajnani, inwardly there is nothing in-common. &lt;strong>Only from the speech and acts you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make out. Jnani hides his/her virtue.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Posture in the meditation makes a tremendous difference. Minds gets tuned, you feel at peace immediately.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When there is no thought, only alertness, there is no division&lt;/strong>. You do not experience the second, the other. You remain thoughtless - pure awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anger
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meditate on the question: is there a justifiable anger? Answer should be no. Frustration is OK, anger is not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Becoming angry might come naturally, but then you overcome the nature. When there is no attention, anger takes over. &lt;strong>When there is attention, thought becomes powerless&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waking consciousness - movement of the thought. What lies beyond that is god.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the so called trials are just mere ignorance. Don&amp;rsquo;t label it. If you label it, you have to face it. &lt;strong>There is no failure until you call it failure. It is an event&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The food is not so good? Leave it. Don&amp;rsquo;t label it. It becomes routine and loses its capacity to make you ecstatic or sad. It becomes routine stuff. All these outer things become bland. When you stop labeling everything &amp;ldquo;becomes&amp;rdquo; bland. Let it be. You&amp;rsquo;ll be in uninterrupted happiness&lt;/strong>! That&amp;rsquo;s the secret of happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no place to go and no place to travel. Travelling for pleasure is to escape the sorrow of our monotonous, painful and ugly daily lives. Therefore one needs an escape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>American System: first they make you work like a slave to get a lot of money and they they have a system to take away the money.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ananda
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Worldly achievements are all illusory (don&amp;rsquo;t tell to high-school students). All is well and perfect as it is. In this creation, there is nothing imperfect. &lt;strong>Correctly translated sa:ananda = perfection&lt;/strong>. Another translation: sat-cit-ananda = existence, awareness, perfection. &lt;strong>Having originated from Brahman jagat cannot be anything but perfection. Brahmadrsti: there is perfection everywhere, except whatever you project with your own mind.&lt;/strong> Did you ever come across the law of gravity being violated?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How to sustain it? If you try to, then you&amp;rsquo;ve lost it. Just have an open mind.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t try to be perfection, you are. &lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t try to repeat it. All you do: whatever disturbs the insight, keep away. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to grasp it, repeat it, let it happen. Then the natural thing happens the natural way.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Physical death is inevitable. Spiritual death should be avoided at all cost -&amp;gt; gain knowledge (jnanam).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>To know God is to deny God. What you know cannot be God.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody has complete knowledge of the world. Thus only &lt;strong>self-knowledge - knowledge of the ignorance&lt;/strong> of the self - is left.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are conscious of your ignorance, you&amp;rsquo;re a vijnasu, not a ajnaha. Ajnaha is ignorant of his ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the truth of the self, there is no chance that you will know the truth of the world. One takes appearances for reality -&amp;gt; pain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The feeling &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo; is so strongly rooted in human consciousness. There is only one thing to know - to know that you&amp;rsquo;re ignorant.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I see the ignorance in the consciousness. I declare: I do not know. This takes you out of the realm of ignorance and dawns knowledge. All I see around and within is what I do now know. That makes you a person of a humble heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In knowing that I do not know I cross the frontier of the known and enter into the realm of unknown and unknowable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One who &amp;ldquo;knows&amp;rdquo; lives in his fool&amp;rsquo;s paradise, buries his head in the sand and is bound to die a spiritual death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I know that I&amp;rsquo;m, what/who I&amp;rsquo;m I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Knowing&amp;rdquo; the self we take body/mind for the self and live the life of the ego. Main hallmark of this is selfishness. He lives a life of petty cares (OMG, my hair is turning white).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The palaces and castles of the selfish are worse than jails. Out of ignorance we forge the chains that bind us and live a life of hell on earth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignorance is the bed of thorns. As long as you are steeped in it, you cannot enjoy the fruits of freedom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more you are clear about ignorance the more you become free of ignorance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A person who dies when the body dies is dead spiritually. When you are dead to the world and the body, that is emancipation. That is moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Enjoyment of sense pleasures is the direct path to decay and death.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignorance -&amp;gt; pursuit of pleasures, riches and religion that is subservient to those two.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Goal: knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quality: simplicity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have self-confidence. Be punctual, it shows you are earnest about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is relationships.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to enrich every relationship with love. Don&amp;rsquo;t put reciprocity, expectations in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seek love which is God. Seek freedom (psychological freedom from expectations, from seeking advantage) so you can discover that love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love is unity in diversity. If diversity is real, there is no love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In non-duality the truth is one but appears as many. Differences but not divisions. We are all one in essence but different in appearance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are able to overlook the outward differences because you focus on the inner source which is the same in all living beings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In dualistic ethics there is no scope for forgiveness. How can you forgive real evil? Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Christ were teaching non-dualistic ethics, forgiving your enemies.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Advertising has chasing us cars and clothes. Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don&amp;rsquo;t need.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our Great War is a spiritual war, our Great Depression is our lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop trying to control everything and just let go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip one on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night and then throw it away.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>lož je ložou len vtedy, ak máš osobný príbeh&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>celý život si sťažuješ, lebo neprijímaš zodpovednosť. &lt;strong>prijať zodpovednosť znamená, že si kvôli tomu ochotný aj umrieť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>v tvojom živote bola raz jedna veľmi významná blondínka. už nie je. z jediného dôvodu - &lt;strong>bol si príliš dostupný. vždy si bol na dosah a žil si úplne rutinne.&lt;/strong> jedine, čo vám nakoniec zostalo bola nuda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>umenie loviť je schopnosť stať sa neprístupným. byť neprístupný znamená, že sa sveta okolo seba dotýkaš len zriedka.&lt;/strong> nezoberieš si päť prepelíc, ale dve. neodlomíš vetvičku len tak. nevystavíš sa vetru bez oprávnenia. nezneužívaš a nevysávaš ľudí. &lt;strong>zámerne sa vyhýbaš tomu, aby si vyčerpával seba alebo druhých.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>lovec vie, že vždy a znovu naláka zver do pasce a tak si nerobí starosti. robiť si starosti znamená byť prístupný. robiť si starosti znamená, že začneš na niečom ľpieť a ak na niečom ľpieš, musíš vyčerpať každého a všetko, na čom ľpieš.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>je neprístupný, pretože svoj svet nevysáva. ľahko naň zaťuká, zostane v ňom ako dlho potrebuje a potom sa rýchlo presune a nezostane po ňom ani stopa. využíva svoj svet striedmo, jedno či sa jedna o rastliny, ľudí, zvieratá, či sily. svoj svet dôverne pozná a napriek tomu je preň neprístupný.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>spontánnosť. Don Juan zahúkal ako továrenská siréna na obedňajšiu prestávku.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>zámerne ma vydesil svojím neočakávaným chovaním, aby mi ukázal, ako strašne predvídateľne jednám ja. aj lov premeníš na mechanicku rutinu. ja &lt;strong>nerobím nič mechanicky&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>dobrý lovec pozná zvyky svojej koristi. preto je dobrým lovcom&lt;/strong> (ak nevieš pri partičke pokru po chvíľke, kto bude ošklbaný, budeš to ty).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>lovec nemá žiadnu rutinu. nie je ako zvieratá, ktoré loví. je slobodný, neuchopiteľný, nepredvídateľný.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>niektoré zvieratá nejde vystopovať. preto sú vzácne. nemajú žiadnu rutinu. preto sú kúzelné.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>priemerný človek sa bojí a preto sa stane korisťou. preto mu zostávajú dve možnosti. ujsť alebo si pripraviť zbraň a postaviť sa k súboju. keď v divočine stopuje lovec, nikdy nevstúpi na miesto, bez toho aby si uvedomoval, aké sú jeho ochranné body.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="9---posledná-bitka-na-zemi">9 - Posledná bitka na zemi&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lovec musí žiť ako lovec, aby mal zo života čo najviac.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dobrý lovec mení svoje spôsoby tak často, ako potrebuje.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čím si tvrdohlavejší, tým lepšie to bude, až sa ti nakoniec podari zmeniť.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>všetci sme hlupáci, ani ja nie som výnimkou.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>máš pocit, že si dôležitý, že je tvojou povinnosťou vysvetľovať, čo robíš, ako by si bol jediný na svete, kto chybuje. neprijímaš zodpovednosť za svoje činy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>záleží na každom čine, lebo sme v tomto tajuplnom svete len chvíľku a ta je moc krátka na to aby sme mohli poznať všetky jeho divy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>myslíš si, že más dosť času, že život bude trvať vecne. &lt;strong>všetko, čo robíš, musí byť tvoj posledný skutok na zemi.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>šťastní ľudia jednajú s plným vedomím, že nemajú čas a preto ich činy majú zvláštnu silu. majú silu, pokiaľ ten čo jedna vie, že tieto činy sú jeho poslednou bitkou. Ináč cely tvoj život budu iba činy bázlivého a opatrného človeka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>smrť tohto králika je darom, rovnako ako jedného dna bude tvoja smrť darom pre niekoho iného. (Butler: v každom zvierati je Kristus, ktorý pre nás zomiera).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="10---byť-prístupný-sile">10 - Byť prístupný sile&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>rozdiel medzi bojovníkom a lovcom je, že bojovník je na ceste k sile zatiaľ čo lovec o nej vie veľmi málo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník je lovec, ktorý nemá chybu, lovec, ktorý lovi silu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>pri snívaní máš silu.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mäso (strava) je prestúpené silou.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pre neho bolo zjavne hračkou zostávať v absolútnej nehybnosti celé hodiny.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nemeniť jedálne návyky príliš drasticky.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sila (Shakti) - z počiatku neuveriteľná a strašne vzdialená záležitosť, že je ťažké o nej aj premýšľať. niečo neovládateľného, čo prichádza k človeku. spôsobuje zázraky priamo pred očami. a konečne sila je niečo v človeku, niečo, čo ovláda tvoje činy a predsa poslúchne tvoje rozkazy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>snenie - život, Lílá, teda jej sen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>stav pre &amp;ldquo;zastavenie sveta&amp;rdquo; - spojuje bázeň, moc, silu a smrť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="11---bojovníkové-rozpoloženie">11 - Bojovníkové rozpoloženie&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>usilovať o dokonalosť ducha bojovníka je jedinou úlohou hodnou nášho ľudstva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>predstava, že si vydaný na milosť a nemilosť je neprístupná. nikto nikomu na svete neubližuje, tobôž nie bojovníkovi. preber zodpovednosť (buď ti je po vôli to, čo sa s tebou deje, alebo s tým niečo rob).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>podrobnosti ani živosť snov nie sú dôležité.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vidieť svoje ruky = snívať.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ovládať svoje sny.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mal si primeranú mieru sebaovládania a primeranú mieru odovzdania sa. dokážeš prekonať sám seba, ak si v patričnom rozpoložení. bojovník si ten stav vytvára sám. jednať v takom stave je veľmi výhodne. odhodíš v ňom všetky hovadiny a zostaneš prečistený.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>človek potrebuje rozpoloženie bojovníka pre všetko, čo robí, ináč sa pokriví a oškaredie. potom kňučíš, že ťa nútia všetci tancovať, ako pískajú, že si list vo vetre. v takom živote nie je sila.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník je lovcom, berie všetko v úvahu. to je ovládanie. ale len čo sú úvahy u konca, jedná. to je odovzdanie sa. bojovník nie je listom vo vetre, nikto s nim nepohne, aby robil niečo proti sebe alebo proti svojmu najlepšiemu úsudku.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>bojovník môže byt zranený, ale nikdy urazený. nie je preňho nič urážlivého v činoch jeho blížnych, teda pokiaľ je v zodpovedajúcom rozpoložení.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="12---bitka-sily">12 - Bitka sily&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>neponechať nič na náhode, všetko sa počíta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ak ide o lov sily, nemôžeš mať žiaden konkrétny plán. lovec lovi to, čo sa mu ukáže - musí byt stále v pohotovosti.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sila je pocit, ktorý ma človek z určitých veci. je osobná záležitosť. nemôžeš ju pripútať ani presne povedať, čo je.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ja som tak mladý, ako chcem byť. ak si ukladáš osobnú silu, telo dokáže neuveriteľne kúsky. ak ju premrháš, bude z teba za chvíľu tlstý starec.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kto loví silu, pozoruje všetko a všetko mu predáva nejaké tajomstvo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>si človek a máš nebezpečné a záludne sklony - trváš na tom, aby sa ti všetko vysvetľovalo k tvojej plnej spokojnosti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>nemôžeš odísť bez poďakovania. bojovník sa neobracia chrbtom sile, bez toho, aby sa poďakoval za dobro, ktoré sa mu dostalo.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>naučiť svojho ducha kľudne a nezúčastnené prihliadať.&lt;/strong> nič z toho, čo robím, nesmie prezradzovať, čo cítim. miesta sily majú schopnosť vysávať rozrušených ľudí.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="13---posledné-stanovisko-bojovníka">13 - Posledné stanovisko bojovníka&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>musíš byť nekonečne opatrný. keď človek zachádza s silou, musí byť dokonalý. tuto bývajú omyly smrteľne.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>musíš sa starať o toto miesto a toto miesto sa postará o teba. &lt;strong>cela táto zem (ktorú vidíš) je tvoja.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>každý rys si ulož do pamäti. toto je miesto, kde budeš ukladať svoje zdroje a rezervy. budeš tu prichádzať v snení. tu ti budu odhalené tajomstva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>snívať - mentálna aktivita počas bdenia, fantázia.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čo človek prežíva s snením, by sa malo zhodovať s dennou dobou, kedy sníva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>miesto, ktoré si obľúbil. tam zomrieš, bez ohľadu na to, kde budeš. bude to miesto presýtené nezabudnuteľnými spomienkami, miesto zázrakov, odhalenia tajomstva, miesto, kde si si uložil silu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník ma povinnosť sa vracať na miesto, ktoré si obľúbil, vždy, keď narazí na silu, aby si ju tam uložil. chodiť tam môže tak, že príde alebo, že sníva.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finálna rekapitulácia: tam bojovník zatancuje svoj posledný tanec. umieranie je veľkolepá, monumentálna záležitosť. tu budeš vyprávať o bitkách, čo si vyhral, prehral, o radostiach a ochromeniach. o zázrakoch, ktoré si nazbieral. smrť tu bude sedieť a pozorovať ťa. a keď dôjdeš na koniec svojho tanca, ukáže smrť na juh.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="14---chôdza-sily">14 - Chôdza sily&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>osobná sila je pocit. niečo, ako keď si šťastný. môžeš to nazývať rozpoloženie.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>loviť silu sa nedá dopredu nijak plánovať. a presne to je na tom to vzrušujúce.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(telo, sila a mladosť). &lt;strong>zachádzam so sebou dobre a preto nemám dôvod sa cítiť unavený či nesvoj. tajomstvo nie je v tom, čo robím, ale skôr v tom, čo nerobím.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čo by som mal robiť, don Juan? Nič, pokračuj ako doteraz. Sila ti nájde cestu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník sa vždy dobre uistí, že všetko je v riadnom stave - súčasť bezchybného jednania.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník jedna, ako by vedel, čo robí, aj keď v skutočnosti nevie nič.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bojovník jedna bezchybne, keď dôveruje svojej osobnej sile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>silu zbieraš tak, že postupne uzatváraš všetky body, odkiaľ ti odteká.&lt;/strong> to nemusíš robiť zámerne, pretože sila si sama nájde vždy spôsob, ako to spraviť. sila je nepostrehnuteľná, keď sa zbiera a ukladá.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>máš v sebe niečo veľmi jalové. ty mi proste chceš vyhovieť. odjakživa chceš každému vyhovieť, každému sa prispôsobuješ a tým sa samozrejme automaticky staviaš nad všetkých a nad všetko.&lt;/strong> tvoje prispôsobovanie je jalové, zráža ťa k úbohosti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jedinými protivníkmi, ktorí sú nám rovní, sú naši blízki.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vždy, keď si za mnou prišiel, sa tvoje &lt;strong>telo&lt;/strong> naučilo isté veci, aj proti tvojej vôli.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;nedelat, co umím delat&amp;rdquo; je kľúčom k sile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>prvým cieľavedomým krokom, ako zbierať a ukladať osobnú silu, je dovoliť telu, aby &amp;ldquo;nedelalo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> (meditácia).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="15---nedeláni">15 - Nedeláni&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>unavuje ma, že sa stále považuješ za nekonečne dôležitú bytosť, ktorej je treba stále znovu a znovu dokazovať, že svet je neznámy a zázračný.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>neľutuj nič, čo si kedy robil, lebo &lt;strong>keď hodnotíš skutky napr. na zlé a dobré, prikladáš svojmu ja neopodstatnenú dôležitosť.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>buď dosiahneme, že je nám mizerne, alebo zo seba spravíme silného človeka. množstvo práce, čo nás to stoji, je rovnaké.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>deláni je to, čo robí tebe tebou a mňa mnou (čo robí niečo niečím - priradenie nama-rupa). keď sa na niečo dívaš, je to delani a keď niečo vidíš, je to nedelani. &lt;strong>bez určitého deláni by v našom okolí nebolo nič známeho.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>delani by znamenalo, nechať ten kamienok niekde povaľovať, pretože je malý kamienok. nedelani znamená zachádzať s kamienkom tak, akoby bol mnohom viac než obyčejný kameň.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>priemernému človeku záleží na tom, či je niečo pravda, alebo nie, ale bojovníkovi nie. ak je niečo pravda, priemerný človek jedná a verí tomu, čo robí. &lt;strong>bojovník jedná v oboch prípadoch. ak je niečo pravdivé, robí to kvôli &amp;ldquo;delani&amp;rdquo;. ak je niečo vyhlásené za nepravdivé, bude stále jednať, tentokrát kvôli &amp;ldquo;nedelani&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>najťažšia časť z bojovníkovej cesty je uvedomenie, že &lt;strong>svet je pocit.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nedelani je veľmi jednoduché, ale ťažké. nejde o to tomu rozumieť, ale o to to zvládnuť. konečným cieľom človeka oddaného poznaniu je vidieť, a videnie dosiahne iba vtedy, keď zastaví svet pomocou techniky nedelani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď človek niečo robí s ľuďmi, mal by sa starať iba o to, aby vec predložil ich telu. nezáleží, či rozumejú, či nie.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>aby bol človek v bezchybnej forme, potrebuje jedno a to zaoberať sa nedelanim.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tiene sú ako dvere k nedelani (tieň je, aj nie je).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>na poznanie najvnútornejších pocitov druhých treba pozorovať ich tieň.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>zväčšiť svet, tak, že ho zredukuješ: zameraj sa na detail, dostane nevídanú ostrosť a detaily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>musíš nechať svoje telo, aby objavilo pocit sily a nedelani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>myslieť si o sebe niečo, či presný opak, je delani&lt;/strong> (pekný/škaredý). &lt;strong>pripútať sa k hocijakému takému delani je strata času. Prísť k skutočnej bytosti v tebe, je nedeláni ja.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>nedelani je vec tela.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>tvoje lovisko je v tomto svete (ukázal na rušnú ulicu). delaniu sveta nie je možne uniknúť a tak bojovník premení tento svet na svoje lovisko. bojovník vie, že svet je tu, aby bol užívaný a tak ho využíva do posledného kúsku.&lt;/strong> bojovník je ako ten pirát, ktorý si bez škrupuli zoberie všetko a používa to, s tým rozdielom, že &lt;strong>nemá námietky, ak niekto iný vezme jeho a nemá pocit, že by sa mu ubližovalo, ak je sam používaný.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>na tej oslave si bol ako šašo, nie preto, že by to bolo slúžilo tvojmu účelu, ale preto, že si sa vydal ľudom napospas. nikdy si nič neovládal a preto si musel utiecť.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Bojovník je stále bdelý, aby sa ho chopil. Žiješ tak, že nenechávaš nič na náhode?&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>oddávaš sa snahám všetko vysvetľovať (vysvetlenie - niečo zo (vy) svet(l)a). v tvojom prípade už nie sú vysvetlenia potrebne.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>telo ti povie. &lt;strong>hlava - vysvetlenia, telo pocity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dneska ti kojoti nehovoria nič a nevidíš čary sveta. to všetko si robil proste preto, že sa v tebe čosi zastavilo. od chvíle, kedy sa narodíme, nám stále niekto hovorí, že svet je taký a taký atď., a preto prirodzene nemáme inú možnosť, než vidieť svet, ako nám hovoria.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>čarodej, ktorý nevidí, veri, že kojoti hovoria, ale ten, kto vidí vie, že veriť tomu znamená uviaznuť v ríši čarodejov. a podľa rovnakej mieri neveriť, že kojoti rozprávajú, znamená uviaznuť v ríši obyčajných ľudí.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kojotí čarodej - ten, kto mnoho veci čerpá od svojich bratov. ideálny spoločník - zmija.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to skutočne, o čo ide, nastáva, keď si telo uvedomí, že vie vidieť. iba potom môže človek poznať, že svet, na ktorý sa denne dívame, je iba popis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>aby človek videl, musí sa naučiť dívať na svet ináč, a jediný spôsob, ktorý poznám, je svet čarodejov.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>vedel som, že idem správnym smerom, a že tie fantómy sa ma snažia odlákať z cesty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>po stretnutí s spojencom už nebolo skutočné nič.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>cesta je skutočná, iba pútnici skutoční nie sú.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>stretneš sa s spojencom, zápasíš a skrotíš ho. potom sa budeš chcieť vydať domov, ale čo si tam zanechal bude navždy stratené. to už budeš čarodej, ale to ti nepomôže. v tú chvíľu je pre nás všetkých dôležité iba to, že sme opustili všetko, čo milujeme alebo nenávidíme alebo si prajeme.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tvoj spojenec roztočí iba teba samotného a uvrhne ťa do neznámych svetov.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď sa roztočíš s svojím spojencom, zmení sa tvoja predstava sveta. a predstava je všetko, čo je. a keď sa zmení, zmení sa sam svet.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Genaro zanechal svoju vášeň v Ixtlane. nechal tam svoj domov, svojich ľudí, všetky veci, o ktoré stál. A teraz sa túla s svojimi citmi a niekedy, ako hovori, možno dorazí do Ixtlanu. nostalgia.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>odišiel som, ale vtáci zostávajú a spievajú. a mal som pocit, že nás všetkách troch zaplavila vlna veľkej bolesti a neopísateľného osamotenia.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>človek na ceste poznania prežije, iba ako bojovník, lebo jeho umenie je udržiavať rovnováhu medzi hrôzou, že je človek, a zázrakom, že je človek.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>keď si niečo vynucuješ, nič nezískaš (nechcem nič, čo mi nie je dané).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ak chceš prežiť, musíš byť jasný ako kryštál a musíš si byť sám sebou absolútne istý.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="class-1">Class 1&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>considered highest text of Vedanta. Something like Mandukya. Generally not taught to beginners.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>requires an open mind. &lt;strong>When you have an open mind, you will not be there. Only the faculty of cognition will be there. If you are a person, then you are not open&lt;/strong>. Keep aside satyatvabuddhi about the world - an agenda in the world and dehAbhimAna&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pot is vAcAramabhaNaM - born from speech -&amp;gt; mind -&amp;gt; nama (mouth), rupa (mind). There is only clay.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you call jagat it just appears as mental image and it disappears and the mental image resolves. That&amp;rsquo;s the only reality of jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramana Maharsi: &lt;strong>you don&amp;rsquo;t see jagat independent of you as a person. And you don&amp;rsquo;t feel yourself as a person until and unless you are interacting with a world outside of you. Ego and world come and sink together.&lt;/strong> Originate from the same source. And in themselves &lt;strong>both are not real, just an appearance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jagat: there is nothing. Not even the knower of nothing is there. It is all just an appearance. &lt;strong>Both Baudhas and Vedantins come to the same conclusion.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as the mind moves, the world is there. When it stops, like in sleep or samadi, the experience of the jagat is there not anymore.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sakshi, substratum, adhisthana. Some satyam has to be there. The knowingness, brahman, my self - I am.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need a ground. That ground is you. That ground is atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you know the truth, then there is nothing more to say. Enlightened people are generally very quiet people. &lt;strong>We, students like us, grow in silence and peace. Set aside meaningless speech and emotions. Rise above vishi-vashi sentimentality. We should not interact with the world too much.&lt;/strong> E.g. offence: it is your ego that doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to understand the truth. It tells you this and that is real. There cannot be hurt without ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be quiet, meditate instead of social engagement. Spend the time in silence, contemplation and shravanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family life and honest profession are never an obstacle to the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One who has raga dvesha is an egoic entity. He becomes karta and bhokta, which produces further raga dvesha -&amp;gt; circle of samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Words coming from silence are also silence. Words coming from the ego are just noise.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seer, seeing, seen. When you see a flower, is it included in the seeing? Seeing pervades the seen. And, can there be a seer without seeing? It is the seeing that pervades the seer. When you see an object. &lt;strong>The seeing is the truth, but appears as though divided in two (seer, seen). Seeing comes/is first, then seer and seen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you see is unreal. It is all mithya. That you see is real. Like movie or a dream - what you see is unreal, that you see is real.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the conditioned upadhi are the jnaneindriyas, then you have drastha, darshanam, drsya. When karmeindriyas are the upadhi then you have karta, kriya and hetuh (reason -&amp;gt; ego).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are enjoyer only when there is imagination that you are enjoyer. Only the space-like awareness is real. Until I know it, it is the Brahman. When I know it, it is the atma.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-2---ananda">Class 2 - Ananda&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vedantins: sat and cit are one and the same and real - Brahman / atma. Generally in duality they are seen separately. &lt;strong>What exists (sat) is outside and the knowledge (cit) of existence is inside you. This is how we are divided.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no outside. Everything is in you. You are the ground of all nama rupas.&lt;/strong> There is nothing outside of you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cit is the nature of sat and sat is the reality. Ananda is the fragrance of sat cit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generally in a pleasure situation a lot of movement of the mind happens. This is often reflected outside (talking, dancing &amp;hellip;). Pleasure - mind is put on excited, high-state of energy. If it stays long in this state -&amp;gt; burn out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pleasure - you are very self-conscious about it (my victory, my success &amp;hellip;). You are not conscious of ananda. There are no attributes to be concious of, no want, no limitation. You cannot describe it in a positive way.&lt;/strong> You just merge and are the ananda. Whatever comes from outside and goes is timebound. Whatever is your own is timeless - ananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sat cit ananda = satyam shivam sundaram. Sundaram - inner beauty, a perfection of the entire creation itself. When you look at the world there is a sense of beauty which is mind-made and therefore very transient.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Transitive verbs - bring about duality easily. Suggest there is an actor and objects.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tamoguna covers the ever-shining sat-cit-ananda. Sattvaguna reflects it. More rajoguna (krodha, lobha, moha) -&amp;gt; less ananda.&lt;/strong> Tamasic people (overeating, too much sleeping, substance abuse) -&amp;gt; even less ananda. More sattva = more ananda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ananda - source of life. That is what makes you an animated body mind persona. That is the Iswara. It is the hub-like atma which keeps prana and apana in place and through them body is kept alive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to find it? There is no how! Just try, you cannot fail. Sadhana: we have to discover it (ananda) before the body falls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God - Ishwara is like a sphere with infinite radius. Contains everything, includes, pervades and transcends the space. Sphere with infinite radius has the center everywhere. In every human heart. Shining in every place and shining without action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Thinking creates an entity. That entity you are not.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m - being is never in doubt, or do you ever experience &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not&amp;rdquo;? Aham asmi is optional. Sometimes it is there, sometimes not. But naham asmi is never there, it is not possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jagat drsyate (appears). Jagat nasti. Appearance only can be negated. &amp;ldquo;Even this will pass&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman/atma is nameless, because you need attributes for a name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A person of discrimination will not revel in all these sense pleasures (Gita 5:22)&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to live life as an enlighten person. This is what Yoga Vasistha is about.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is like martial arts - there are levels of students (like belts).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you take unreal for real your ability to see the real is strongly compromised. It is enough to negate the bhrama - (error, delusion). Name of the delusion is jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Certain questions cannot be answered. They can only be seen as wrong. E.g. when, where, how did the Big Bang happen?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The inexplicable is explained by Maya. Like blue color of the atmosphere. There is no blue color. It&amp;rsquo;s just trick the dispersed light, senses and the mind play on you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-3">Class 3&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Isvara is always pointed out with the pronoun &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s that &lt;strong>reality that you cannot perceive with eyes, conceive with mind (ideate), because it has no nama rupa. But you can feel it.&lt;/strong> You cannot miss this presence, this godliness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Origin of bhrama: we are so much accustomed to sensual perceptions that we think that only what can be perceived / conceived (thus has a nama rupa) exists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The body of Brahman is akasha. Everywhere is in akasha - it is the reality in which everything comes and go. Brahman - it is the pervasive akasha that is shining (prakasha) by itself . You don&amp;rsquo;t experience space. It is inferred by the mind. But it has to be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cit = evidence. Brahman = all-pervasive expansive cit = Isvara = that (indescribable, wonder you cannot miss)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind = past and future. That which IS mind can never reach. When the mind is, there is no present. And when the present is, there is no mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Citta (heart, memory, reason, mind, love) minus modification resolves to cit. Mind cannot conceive the present, but it can merge with it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind itself has many categories. Intellection, ideation, imagination, emotions, recollection, I-thought&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jivan mukta has &lt;strong>no aspirations and no fear.&lt;/strong> He&amp;rsquo;s purna. He can smile at the sword that is going to kill him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahmajnani = brahmajnana = brahman.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Purification is always karma.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have to move from &amp;ldquo;srsti drsti vada&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;drsti srsti vada&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong>Srsti is not parinama - a modification of the godhead. It is an appearance. In your drsti the srsti appears. Whenever there is appearance (modification) there must be your srsti (seeing) first.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Seeing itself is creation.&lt;/strong> Like seeing of a daemon for a mental patient.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In cetana parinama (change) is not possible. Only in jada is.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the beginning. srsti-drsti: god creates from a second substance -&amp;gt; god creates from nothing (miracle) -&amp;gt; god creates by modification (parinama vada; would make god insentient object) -&amp;gt; Drsti-srsti vada: god upholds the appearance of the world. &lt;strong>Reality is that which makes the appearance possible.&lt;/strong> Without light you cannot have a movie -&amp;gt; soham, because jagat is only an appearance - illusion (something, that is not there).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The child doesn&amp;rsquo;t see a blue dome of the sky. It slowly starts seeing things the way elders see them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Out of 100 things only one thing is registered. Same for sounds, smell&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a huge difference between identity and equality. Jiva ID isvara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t give a second thought to the thing called jagat. Just ignore and forget it. Or do you record all the dreams do you have? This is the highest state of jivanmukta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you are looking outside you are dreaming. When you look within you are awake.&lt;/strong> You look out and see is my house, my people, think about your plans, past &amp;hellip; Contemplate upon akasha, the flow of thoughts stops and start feeling the fragrance of reality. When the mind is no mind you already are in communion with reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Virtual world: the jagat is born out of your imagination just like the blue of the sky. Just like digital world. Where is it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahma - adhyAsa (superimposition). &lt;strong>It is not a bhrama as long as you are in it. And as you come out of it, there is no bhrama either. Maya. It is neither sat nor asat.&lt;/strong> With knowledge you cannot take it for real because you know it is unreal. Without knowledge you cannot take it for unreal because you don&amp;rsquo;t know better.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m so and so is a vasana = mental impression = samskara. Born out of ignorance. Discover and reject them. You&amp;rsquo;ll function more efficiently as you are not weighted down by the vasanas. You&amp;rsquo;ll discover you&amp;rsquo;re in the Presence all the time. Whatever you&amp;rsquo;ll do is mediation. Meditation = communion, realization of the fragrance of the reality in everything. It&amp;rsquo;s the vasana that covers up the fragrance of reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Means of cognition help you to know a thing that wasn&amp;rsquo;t known before. Sruti will not make you know something you haven&amp;rsquo;t known before. It resolves the limited idea about yourself. Along with ajnana all the vasanas are eliminated -&amp;gt; atma is shining.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-4---bodha-vicara">Class 4 - bodha, vicara&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>That, oneness, cannot be experienced. Experience is a process and has a division (experiencer, object of experience) associated.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upasakas - reaching the loka of devata is moksha for them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For vedantins there is no gaining. &lt;strong>What you gain you&amp;rsquo;ll lose again.&lt;/strong> For them moksha is the svarupa = brahman = atma. Bandha is the ignorance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bodha = realization. jnanam = knowledge. There is no pot realization, except understanding it is only nama rupa. That&amp;rsquo;s why we say normally only ghatajnamam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flying helicopter on the screen in a movie. Is there any? It would tear the screen. Where is the flying helicopter? In myself. I&amp;rsquo;m the substratum in which the flying helicopter is seen. The flying helicopter is an appearance on the substratum of the conscious being that I&amp;rsquo;m. What is true to the movie is true to the jagat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jagat na jayate, nasti. jagat drsyate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What makes us suffer is the attachment. And this attachment is part of the drsya&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I can never become an object. I can only be myself. And know that whatever I experience is different from me and unreal. Strictly speaking bodha is knowing what all I&amp;rsquo;m not. It is precondition for atmasakshatkara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Samsara is only a superimposition, an appearance. Without this realization there is nothing like svabodha&lt;/strong> (= atmasakshatkara) in anybody&amp;rsquo;s life at any time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is not a subject matter that is well settled and can be taught systematically like Newton&amp;rsquo;s laws. You have to investigate, inquire, examine, study, contemplate and come to know all in yourself..&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Devaloka - ambience of bhoga. Once you are there you&amp;rsquo;ll be busy with bhogas. Therefore the question of understanding of Vedanta doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur. Example: gala dinner.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why am I born in this world as a human being? Bhagavan&amp;rsquo;s reply: so you can reach me. There is no other purpose. Therefore do shravanam. And understand it for yourself so you can claim it as your knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generally people are experts in quoting. But that is missing the point. Sastra and sravanam is not about being a member of a club and expanding it. Thoughts we have picked up by sravanam have to be converted into living thoughts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Till you know you&amp;rsquo;d listen&amp;rdquo; - very nice escape route. One has to feel a sense of urgency about integrating this knowledge. Look within, search within. Sravanam is not only about listening alone (like listening to puranas). It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it complete. It needs also vicara (inquiry, exploration, journey).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In other journeys the goal is important and path there only as much as it takes you to the goal. &lt;strong>In Vedanta, there is no goal. You are the goal. It is an exploration without a goal, without a path.&lt;/strong> You don&amp;rsquo;t travel on a path yet you reach the end of a path. Any journey requires time. Here, there is no time involved. Pathless. Goalless. &lt;strong>The entire emphasis is on exploration - vicara.&lt;/strong> You constantly explore and as you explore you&amp;rsquo;ll discover newer and newer horizons of yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma has infinite expressions. Where will it end? &lt;strong>Exploration is the goal. There is no kheda - distress. You are exploring your own svarupa.&lt;/strong> Atma is the only thing lovable in the creation in itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-love - I love my body, mind, emotions, ego vs. love of the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation - exploration into the unknown. Free transport into my own svarupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Normal misconception: I&amp;rsquo;m is sustained by thinking, doing and speaking. (In silence) I&amp;rsquo;m.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The word &lt;strong>appearance and experience is the same&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Everybody has a world vision, there is common elements but it is always subjective. My table is different than yours. Three people are looking at the same rope: one sees a snake, the other an ornament, the last a piece of wood.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even when you use &amp;ldquo;existence&amp;rdquo; as word, put &amp;ldquo;seeming&amp;rdquo; there. It is very practical. Makes a huge difference in a crisis. If you are in a worrisome situation, ask is this real? How many times did we face troubles in the past? They came and went. &lt;strong>Explore, don&amp;rsquo;t conclude.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Problem: people doubt atma. They don&amp;rsquo;t doubt the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jagat is like Aurora Borealis or rainbow - beautiful, yet doesn&amp;rsquo;t really exist.&lt;/strong> Fly into them and see for yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Minus pot-thought there is no pot. The thought is the critical thing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you remain thoughtless, nirvana (the state without suffering) becomes evident. It is there, yet hidden behind active mind, which throws a screen of thoughts on the reality which is yourself. It gives a false notion there there is no other dimension except body and mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Niddidhiasana - cultivating inner silence. In this silence slowly the insight will come - that opposites, duality are not so overwhelming.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-5---vasanas-acquisition">Class 5 - vAsanAs, acquisition&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unless you watch, examine, inquire you will not be able to know the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All attempt to become happy is misery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no enemy outside, just a vasana.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Examine your vasanas - mental impressions - that make us unhappy, so you understand the causes for your sorrow and fear. Because in the space-like knowingness there is no fear nor sorrow. Vasanas rise and fall in atma and as we identify with them a flow of thoughts covers the reality which is space-like knowingness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give up desires (=vasanas) -&amp;gt; moksha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you already have given up is not important. What is still to give up is. Become empty, like space &lt;strong>(don&amp;rsquo;t confuse blank with empty). Open space doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any furnishing and it is beautiful. So is empty mind. Empty mind is creative mind. If the mind is empty the truth comes into its own, and the truth you are.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind free of all the vasanas = brahman. amanibhava.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t create new vasanas and allow the old ones to drop off. Soon the mind will melt away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acquisitiveness of worldly things adds to the vasanas&amp;rsquo; load of the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Stop thinking about the world. Do you duty, that is enough.&lt;/strong> you have already taken care of the world. &lt;strong>You need not save the world. Save yourself. What world do you want to save? One which is a projection of your mind?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pearls and thread -&amp;gt; garland. pancha bhutas and vasanas (thread) -&amp;gt; body. There is no body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>This body has to be cleaned, fed, clothed - the only vasanas that you need. Give up the rest.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you want moksha you have to pay the price of the finite to gain the infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless there is anticipation, expectation there cannot be pleasure, nor pain. Pleasure and pain are mental states, not you. They are driven by memory. In any given situation there is neither pleasure or pain. By individual&amp;rsquo;s response of acceptance or resistance it becomes one. Therefore just watch, be a witness. (It&amp;rsquo;s OK)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depth of my being - divinity. Width of my being - all existence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fear - being unsure about the present state of comfort.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>birth is the single cause of ignorance in human life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People suffer because of what they acquire.&lt;/strong> Both physical burden and burden in head.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In what way is (accumulating) punya different from money?&lt;/strong> Want to play games with god? Stop being clever, manipulative.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>After accumulation comes the problem of safeguarding. You cannot just walk away (that&amp;rsquo;s freedom).&lt;/strong> Riches are the source of endless strife.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The philanthropy of the rich man has its origin in his inner guilt. A rich man cannot have the quality of ahimsa or daya. There is violence in competitiveness and in acquisitiveness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Unless you are fundamentally simple, live a disciplined and orderly life and are a humble-hearted guy, what values are you talking about? Rich man&amp;rsquo;s values are conditioned values, distorted. His god doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in this creation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life and death don&amp;rsquo;t ask what you have? They ask what you are. One has to gain what alone is worth acquiring. Inner silence and peace. Then the truth comes by itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no imperfection in this creation. If you see some, it is your heart. Your mind. World is your projection. Therefore create harmony within. If you have it, they you find god&amp;rsquo;s glory in every bit of the creation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A mind which is preoccupied with thinking the whole day is a sick mind. A mind becomes an effective tool only when you know inner silence.&lt;/strong> Otherwise a mind is punishment, a curse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Once you know the truth, there is no question of losing it again.&lt;/strong> The child will not go to the womb again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Life - state of jivanmukta where the mind is free of all vasanas. saH jivati (he alone lives). All others are just inhaling and exhaling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware of the flow of the thoughts and movement of the ego = mananam. Reflection of what is going behind the curtain. Looking at your face. You get disturbed because you look ugly in the mirror of the sastra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are two kinds of jnanam. vasanajnanam and vivekajnanam. pashus and some people have the first one only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sastra is a burden for people without viveka, it evaporates unless repeated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>People think sound is the music. No. Silence between the notes is the music. That is the shanti. The inner silence. Shanti = stopping, dousing, withholding movement of the mind and yet remaining alertful and watchful&lt;/strong>. If this is not there the mind becomes a tormentor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are not identified with the body/mind in the sleep. So they are not a problem for you. Arrive there in the wakeful state.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-6---ahagkara">Class 6 - ahaGkAra&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;re an ego because of your social situation, religion, culture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever I&amp;rsquo;m I&amp;rsquo;m but I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not the egoic entity. &lt;strong>ahaGkAra -&amp;gt; aham karomi - I&amp;rsquo;m the doer, enjoyer. Ahamkara means body identification.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the ego is created you create a set of values that suit the ego (cementing the ego).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>karmakAnda makes you an egoic entity. Based on the phala you develop attachment to the action.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ego has to pursue vedanta and gain mokSa - highest distortion of Vedanta. &lt;strong>mokSa is not for but from the ego&lt;/strong>. Teaching or studying mokSa zAstra is just another qualification for the ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Child has all the sense organs functioning wonderfully, has prANa, the happiness in the world but the ego is not there. &lt;strong>birth of ego: Raju eats food -&amp;gt; I eat food.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birth and death -&amp;gt; belief system - religion, not philosophy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ego - unreal and amAya (disease). &lt;strong>Most of the diseases originate in the mind, often gastric, back pains. Come from the restlessness of the mind.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>svabhimAna helps to overcome abhimAna (identification - aham mama), which is ahamkara - durabhimAna, darahaGkAra - only. It is the enemy, which projects enemies and friends to the outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless you understand what is sleep you will not understand what is AtmA. I&amp;rsquo;m there in sleep but the ego is not there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Only when you are self-concious that is the ego. You are not self-concious during waking all the time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let there be action, but not on the behalf of ego. That is the karma yoga. Where you are not enjoyer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the ego resolves, all the agitation of the mind comes to an end. it is the egoity that makes the mind more and more agitated and brings, ambition, greed, competition, mental violence into life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ego is an object, not a subject. &lt;strong>you can get rid of the ego by watching the ego instead of identifying with the ego and watching the world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Relationship is like a mirror. If you find there conflict you assume that coming from the other person but it is coming from you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In silence and peace alone people will grow. Try to become outwardly and inwardly silent. Like Buddha I want to remain in my svarupa all the time. Shiva, Dakshinamurti, Buddha are always in meditation. That&amp;rsquo;s the only way to eliminate the enemy called ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware of your own being. If you are, all is resolved, there are no thoughts nothing else.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meditation - observation without being an observer. Centerless observation.&lt;/strong> there is also an action without being an actor. There is the awareness without the ego, thinking without the thinker. &lt;strong>When the center vibrates the entire liquid vibrates.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The vision that something is good or bad is bad already. Good - vision in which the opposites are not there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Give up bhoktRtvam (enjoyership), the greed for karmaphala, which is the foundation of the ego. Then kartRtvam, then name and fame.&lt;/strong> (fall: eva - apple, adam - snake)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as the individual is there, there is no truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Agitation is because of insecurity, characteristic of ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ego is just a thought. A thought is never real. It is a manner of thinking -&amp;gt; speaking -&amp;gt; acting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep the enthusiasm, give up the aham, karma phala greed. Keep the courage. Give credit, don&amp;rsquo;t take credit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need zAnti, not worldly accomplishments. You are students of vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is about the mind, paying attention to the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stomach pain is enough to put an end to the world of comfort you have accumulated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pay proper attention to your mind. Don&amp;rsquo;t focus on the body too much, nor wealth. Conflict - result of the problem of the mind. Make the mind calm and quiet and you will come out of the conflict. You are in sorrow - watch the mind - it was the mind that put you in the sorrow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smoke coming from the mind: intolerance, frustration, anger, resentment, mental resistance. Flame of sorrow, distress, unhappiness. I&amp;rsquo;m getting converted into ashes just like flame converts a heap of wood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accept everything, deny the ego.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People go crazy because of the mind. It wants something by the time it gets it it loses interest. Jumping from one thing to the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mind can be your friend or your enemy.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-7---trsna-insecurity">Class 7 - tRSNA, insecurity&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>tRSNA - greed is like darkness. There is no cap, no end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Insecurity is there because of greed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We spend whole life acquiring things. Acquisitiveness is direct result of the greed that is in our hearts. If there is some, no matter how well positioned in the society, healthy, rich we are, we&amp;rsquo;ll be insecure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents are always insecure about children.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop vairAgya - which is also called vaitRSNya - freedom from greed. You have to dismantle it piece by piece.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All tRSNa, all &lt;strong>greed is the single source of insecurity in our life&lt;/strong>. Makes us blind to the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>samsara, fear, insecurity, living on the verge of sorrow. There are many blemishes in samsara. tRSNA is one of the many, yet it occupies the first place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Greed expresses in the &lt;strong>form of competitive acquisitiveness&lt;/strong>. Makes us suffer for a long time. A person in the forest experiences fear now and then, a person in the palace can&amp;rsquo;t sleep because of his greed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cut the creeper of tRSNA with the sword called viveka. mithya amithya vastu viveka. We come to this world empty handed and we leave it just the same. In between, what is the use of becoming a victim to the endless greed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For some more money a person loses his courage, stability, status etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at birds. They collect food just required for that day. &lt;strong>Do you come across any animal that holds things for the future?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Insurance - paper producing industry. No wealth is produced, just shuffling money here and there. Capital for this industry is our fear.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Basis for our insecurity is always thinking of the future.&lt;/strong> Thinking about the future -&amp;gt; insecurity -&amp;gt; greed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tRSNA expresses in our lives in two ways a) acquisitiveness b) insecurity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>santoSaH - learn to live happily with what you have. Contentment is a great virtue in Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How much land does a person need? A hole of six feet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if a person gets something and is struggling to get something else it shows that he did not get any fulfillment in the first thing. &lt;strong>srI - wealth and rAjya - power they never make you fulfilled.&lt;/strong> Whatever you acquire in this world is transient and superficial.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Desire is the opposite of acceptance. What is is not good, what should be, I imagine. Desire is mind&amp;rsquo;s mechanism to fill that gap.&lt;/strong> foolishness: the desiring mind can never fill fulfillment, contentment in what is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Viveka: wisdom, strength of mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What difference it makes? Time will devour. Don&amp;rsquo;t get completely consumed by what is time-bound. Try to find what is timeless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vairAgya: the body is not mine. The body is not for me (like rented car). Viveka: the body is not me -&amp;gt; all the actions of the body are offered to the whole. I speak, walk, do not for my benefit but as a offering to the whole. Those who think like this are no different from Izvara, from uttama puruSa.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-8---dehabhimana-vairagya">Class 8 - dehAbhimAna, vairAgya&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We identify with the body, create a personality and then get consumed by the problems of personality. All problems belong to it, to the ego. In sleep, there is no body, no person (ego).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you go to sleep, body, person (ego), world merge together. When you wake up they emerge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the person is in place, it starts fretting around issues regarding the person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are not &lt;strong>ready to face the death with a smile on the face.&lt;/strong> They are too busy, they are never ready. That&amp;rsquo;s why nobody will ask their permission.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body will fall sooner than we expect. People never consider the transient nature of life and the body. &lt;strong>People want the dream to continue.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Predecessor of movies - gandharva nagara. Hypnosis by description.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no stability in the lightning, cloud, movie &amp;hellip; body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion: comforts of the body. God: body. Shrine: place where the body is kept. Whole life is gone in catering the needs and demands of the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Body is a tool. Put it to good use. Keep it in good condition. And then leave it alone. You don&amp;rsquo;t identify with a tool. Develop generous indifference towards it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Too much emphasis on food, on well-being of the body becomes very counterproductive. Makes life a lot more difficult.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you fight cancer, it fights back. Peace of mind is robbed for whatever time the person lives. Learn to accept it and learn to live with it. See how it reacts. Don&amp;rsquo;t treat it as an enemy. You&amp;rsquo;ll suffer less. The body has to fall, it is a natural process. Treat it, don&amp;rsquo;t fight it, that will just create conflict in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the body becomes stricken with diseases, you&amp;rsquo;ll not have time for philosophical issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t fight it, you accept it and treat it. Develop some indifference. Whatever you fight it will become stronger.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vairAgya is like vitamins. So that problems of life can be tackled properly. Without vairAgya a person&amp;rsquo;s heart will be broken.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Settled in life - free from all desires and fears.&lt;/strong> In realising the self settlement will come. Study, contemplate, reflect and meditate. Live it, now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unemployment is less painful, worry about unemployment is more painful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Places of enjoyment are very cruel.&lt;/strong> Pleasures created out of riches are all perishable. &lt;strong>They are merciless when the aftereffect starts working.&lt;/strong> People are jealous, society has no mercy. Phalam is derived from perishable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are not a mumukSu, till you have vairAgya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a value system, in which there is no birth and no death. And develop a generous indifference towards the body. Then zrAvaNam, mananam, nididhyAsanam (profound and repeated meditation).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-9---mental-patterns-opposed-to-moksa">Class 9 - mental patterns opposed to mokSa&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Eyesight helps to see things but then it creates its own set of problems, like projections, desires etc.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hearing fills the intellect by vAsanAs by repeated hearing. Can such buddhi be made stable?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taste -&amp;gt; diabetes, heart attack&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The real tsunami is created by the mind. Tormentor sitting inside, which makes people hate, fight each other. Those who are able to withstand this tsunami are the real heroes, not brave great warriors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weapons to fight the mind are viveka and vairAgya. You do not get the sense of self from the body and sense organs. E.g. a person gets blind. If he derives the &lt;strong>sense of self&lt;/strong> from the sense organs he&amp;rsquo;s in big trouble.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People also derive their sense of self from actions. Atma is being, not actions. Once you establish your self as a doer (e.g. teacher), you are in trouble.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mind filled with vAsanAs of sense pleasures is the obstacle to mokSa. You put them in place, you have to remove them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without quietude of the mind you will not be happy in life.&lt;/strong> It is the thoughts that breeds fear and sorrow. In case of heart problems doctors (in India) recommend to eliminate raga dveSa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Japan: vajrAsana (which automatically makes your body straight) + green tea.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is essentially sattva, physical body tamas and sense organs rajas. We fill the mind with so many (karma)vAsanAs that it becomes rajasic, hyperactive and then it becomes tamasic, toxic. Food is tamoguNa.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a rajasic mind there cannot be any quietude. It is very unsteady - &lt;a href="http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;amp;script=hk&amp;amp;tran_input=lola&amp;amp;direct=au&amp;amp;anz=100">lola&lt;/a>. It has become like peacock&amp;rsquo;s tail.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Formula of a samsari: Make money, enjoy, occasionally make some dAnam. You have to acquire viveka and vairAgya when you are healthy and strong. After retirement is too late, the body just crashes and whatever energy you&amp;rsquo;ll have left will be needed to take care of it. Still, better late than never.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jagat = phenomenal world (not just &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo;). Ever in flux. Never the same. Always divided into opposites.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Never say jagat asti or bhavati. It gives a sense of reality&lt;/strong>, yet it is not sat jagat. Say jagat dRzyate (= unreal, mere appearance, mere name - nAmadheya).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you really feel distressed, contemplate on this &amp;ldquo;this life is a dream&amp;rdquo;. Why worry? &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to appreciate reality only when you know that the world is not real. Reality is not something you&amp;rsquo;ll gain. It is already you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cause effect relationship is not really important if the world is not real, not born.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind is getting distracted because you assume jagat is there. Meaning there are things to be gained in jagat (bhogavAsanA) and things to be performed (karmavAsanA).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In vedantic meditation autosuggestion has critical importance. &amp;ldquo;This world is a collection of bhogas. I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in any&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not the doer, the jobs in the world are as unreal us the world - I need not accomplish nothing in the world&amp;rdquo;. REPEAT - abhyAsa, and you will see no difference as whether you are in meditation or not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Gem of human beings - his mind is space-like. Everything is cognised, but nothing sticks.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Real - sthAyI - what is, what persists, what stays. &lt;strong>World is like flash of lightning, it appears and disappears. You cannot hold on to nothing.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Daydreaming.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is like a long hallucination. AtmA/Izvara is real.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-10">Class 10&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Entire samsara is because of identity with the physical body. Learn to live beyond the body consciousness - vairAgya - indifference. &lt;strong>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what kind of dress I wear, what kind of food I eat.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t identify with the body, don&amp;rsquo;t pamper the body. In the name of sadhana don&amp;rsquo;t punish the body. Be very balanced about it - &lt;strong>be generous yet indifferent&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ramakrishna&amp;rsquo;s view of the body: &amp;ldquo;machine that manufactures impurities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> Anything that comes in contact with the body needs to be cleaned after few minutes. If you want to keep the body in good condition, you&amp;rsquo;d not identify with it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As you pamper the body, it becomes sick.&lt;/strong> (No) sedentary lifestyle -&amp;gt; (no) diabetes. Shoemakers sitting cross-legged -&amp;gt; never get any kidney disease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whether you hate or love, the relationship will not be long. All relationships are very transient. &lt;strong>Why hate anybody? It is madness.&lt;/strong> As you hate the other you become sad, stressed-out, you spoil your heart. &lt;strong>As you love you become happy yourself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even if the other is objectively doing wrong, see that it is only a small game. SvapnasaGgama. There is no fun in hating anybody, in the knowledge of the very transient nature of human body and relationships, just love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you feel anger, frustration try to get rid of that. It is not good for your psyche, body, spirit. Sit in meditation, remember that person, than visualize after 40 years, what will be this and that bodies? Where will they be?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Neutralize body identity so you can have a peaceful life for the rest of your life.&lt;/strong> In your life stand on the firm ground of the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Skeleton meditation: sit firm in meditation, be aware of the body. Then be aware of the skeleton. There is ground below and the skeleton is routed in the ground (because of gravity). Meditate for 2.5h.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>anityia - transient. Now it is and after some it it is not. asatyam. Hallucination. All the objects incl. body and mind are constantly changing and nothing remains the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>bAlyam - parents are insecure and they transmit it to the children. They have a &lt;strong>blueprint (recipe for happiness)&lt;/strong> - this is what the boy/girl should become. They have a blueprint for their marriage as well. If it happens, they are happy, if not, you are not. They push the children. So the childhood is robbed - by the parents. They give wrong vAsanAs to the children. They give their thoughts instead of their love. They teach what to think, not how to think. Transference - we want to fulfill our dreams through them. Even if the childhood is happy, it is still transient. Like flash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yauvanam - there is energy but not wisdom to use the energy properly. It is also very transient, flash-like. Like a dream that persists for a while.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Instead of living in a simple way, we accumulate - parigraha, saJcaya. Every house is like a museum. Ramana Maharsi: People don&amp;rsquo;t accumulate outside only, they accumulate also in their heart.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>As long as you are carried away by the changing things, the changeless remains hidden.&lt;/strong> Conserve all your energies for one great longing for the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>kAla - time is like a very capable hunter&lt;/strong>, killing us effortlesly. We are its game. One look it enough, no matter what is the status of its prey. It plays without break.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A mind in which vairAgya has taken strong roots knows no unhappiness.&lt;/strong> Events will be happening, yet the person remains in repose. vairAgya = no interest -&amp;gt; no desires. Not a single thing attracts some attachment from you, otherwise desire is not far. All your interest should be attracted towards AtmA only. Finally total absence of expectations: &lt;strong>I do not expect anything from the world, from the people, body, mind. Food is for the body, not for me. I as the pure awareness do not need anything.&lt;/strong> Then you will not know unhappiness, whatever you will get is a gift, a joy.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="qa">Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There might not be a visible difference between vairAgya and depression. Depression - no understanding. Sickness. Biochemistry of the brain in disorder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How to be happy? a) &lt;strong>The only way to be happy is to make others happy.&lt;/strong> b) As long as you are looking for it you don&amp;rsquo;t get it, you&amp;rsquo;ll remain in misery -&amp;gt; you&amp;rsquo;ll remain in constant happiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love, not attachment is needed for the life of gRhastha. &lt;strong>Attachment - we seek something from the other person. Ego&amp;rsquo;s movement.&lt;/strong> In love there is no taking there is only giving.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sphuraNa - shining. &amp;ldquo;I know the pot&amp;rdquo; is an action and there is division between the object and subject vs. &amp;ldquo;the pot is known&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Action of love is a spontaneous action. There is no actor. Body and mind might be tired, but there will be no stress - no emotional drain.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no reality in all this worldliness. There is reality in your heart. There is god in you. The more you get entangled in the affairs of the world, the bigger the price you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay for it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsara - kartrtvam &amp;amp; bhoktrtvam. To believe that you are sustaining the wife and children is the samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Upadesha Sahasri - Swami TV</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-11-19-swami_tv_-_upadesha_sahasri/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-11-19-swami_tv_-_upadesha_sahasri/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIVkPyhriWk&amp;amp;list=PLd6RYR-zr5hHxdqnhshXuLD4FNmXJ_KxM&amp;amp;index=1">Upadesha Sahasri (2019) Talks by Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswati&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="class-1-2">Class 1, 2&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Life - infinite, vast, mystery, not just an occupation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family people, society believes life means securing livelihood. Thinking like this we miss the whole point of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The same life in you is in a bird, sun, stars, rivers, everywhere. Hiranyagarbha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Job, marry, children and become more and more like a machine. Example: wet grinder. Remain fearful, anxious, afraid of life and death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sorrow and joys, both will be there in life. So what you should do is to know yourself. Varuna tells Bhrgu: &lt;strong>dear son, go and find God, go and find truth of life. In Vedanta the teacher encourages to explore and investigate, not only converts - passes down a belief.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If a belief system is offered it cripples the mind of a person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body and the embodied are of two different orders of reality. Find out what is the embodied.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Religious person is in time. Do karma and get the karmaphalam later.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If time has no more meaning then life and death are one. No birth, no death -&amp;gt; timelessness. A spiritual entity is not concerned about death, nor birth, nor continuity. What is spiritual is timeless - eternal. Psychological time has no meaning to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only one word can describe you - aham. &lt;strong>A (beginning) HA (end) M (silence - atma)&lt;/strong>. Apartment standing, apartment collapsed has no influence on the space. You are that space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fan is a fixed point, electricity is not. Fan is good or bad. Electricity is not.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-3-4">Class 3, 4&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The only meaningful comparison of Brahman is to Akasha. Presence all-around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Truth never makes you suffer, it always liberates. The only reason for suffering is ajnana. Once you understand that you are liberated. &lt;strong>Ajnana = taking names and forms to be real.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human mind comes always with the logic to support its folly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Boundaries are imagined by the mind and not real. Only the space is real. Contemplate on the external physical space and the inner space of consciousness with no physical and time boundaries - seed of Brahman - where entire universe abides.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>idam sharIram kshetra - this body is the field, which produces the crop of sukham or dukham (experience).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nothing exists unless it is uploaded to the consciousness. It must be shining in the consciousness. Nothing exists without someone knowing it. Without knowing the body the body doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Who is that who knows the kshetra? Don&amp;rsquo;t conclude nothing about the one who knows the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma = pramatha = the one field knower in all the fields. That is your svarUpa.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the interfaith meeting, interfaith persons won&amp;rsquo;t be there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any object which is perceived can only attract adjectives &amp;ldquo;it is&amp;rdquo; (sat) or &amp;ldquo;it is not&amp;rdquo; (asat). Brahman is not perceivable, not conceivable, beyond the domain of speech. It is one and it is yourself. You can describe something that is other than you, you cannot describe yourself. You can only be yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t rush to conclusions. You&amp;rsquo;ll be overlooking other information.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your persona is based only upon the past. Historic self. Step out of the time (psychologically). You cannot step out of time tomorrow, you can only NOW.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step out of the conditioning (of gurudom) into the realm of Atma, timeless existence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-5-6">Class 5, 6&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Supreme self. If you are able to look at the body it proves you are not the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Progress in samsara is regress in spirituality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Game: watch the mind. Try to understand it. Tell it to shut-up if it wants to make you a dog in the mirror house.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dynamic of your thinking: what you call present is sandwiched between past and future. What you call future is past only. A poet said: &lt;strong>the past flows into the present and covers the entire present and then flows into the future.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Step into the timelessness by objectifying the thinking mind (which is about the past only anyway), be aware.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prana means indriya. Ekadasha rudraha = ekadasha prana. Because they make people cry - people cry only because of the mind and indriyas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whatever is not possible by logic is possible by Maya. Like infinite akasha sitting in the pot.&lt;/strong> Or the infinite being embedded in the finite body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is talking. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m talking. If I feel that I&amp;rsquo;m (guru, &amp;hellip;) then I am talking. Yet I don&amp;rsquo;t have any objections against language conventions which distort reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you do karma with the idea of getting a result and you being the doer. Is your mind getting purer?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doing != being. &lt;strong>Doing is time-bound, prakuruti. Being is timeless, purusha.&lt;/strong> &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a doctor&amp;rdquo; means your being is confused with doing. When mind and body change = action = doing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditation: Think of some enemies. See that the same Iswara is in them as in you. Visualise: When you are breathing, you are breathing the infinite.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only when you feel as ego you have enemies. Only when you shut your eyes to the divinity then you see the foe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Jada is a superimposition on chetana. All is chetana, only the upadhi changes. Like in a movie - mountain, person and a river are all the same light.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atma is not perishable nor not perishable. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into the opposites. It is neither.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman = uttama purushaha = paramatma. If you are carefully looking at the world it points out to a mystery beyond itself. You look within and you can recognise a mystery beyond your limited self. That mystery is one without a second. Don&amp;rsquo;t keep a safe distance from it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-7-8">Class 7, 8&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Handing over a belief system to the student cripples his mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shruti - expression of direct experience vs. smrti - what you pull out from your memory (pickle knowledge, preserved knowledge). Smruti comes from human intellect, shruti&amp;rsquo;s origin is deeper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smruti is valid only if it follows shruti in letter and spirit. Smruti gives laws to people to lead their lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vision of Upanishads replaced with sectarian belief.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manusmrti has made the vision of Sri Krshna from Gita into a dead letter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vision of unity vs. support for fragmentary thinking. You have to find the correct kind of text.&lt;/strong> Whatever stotras you recite should not go against shruti. Study those smrutis and those stotras which do not contradict the shruti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teach only those shrutis and smrutis which present paramatma as asamsari. Teach not text presenting atma (your self) as samsari - sukhi/dukhi, karta/bhokta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>kimkara - dasa = slave. Master asks what to do and I do. Not having own thinking. Just following. Pushes the person into a system.&lt;/strong> Vision of atma should never be compromised. Never present atma as kimkara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid all literature that does encourages subservience of the jiva to some higher gods and thereby encourages undesirable practices in the name of rituals. Same for formulas for more sukham less dukham.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study and think.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vision of every mahatma gets distorted over time. Shankaracharya, Krishna, Christ, Buddha &amp;hellip; In generally it happened to shruti itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teaching: Paramatma is not different from anything else. Vision: when you see the world you see god. &lt;strong>Like a god-expo. There is no seeing god apart from seeing the world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To see god is to be god. Is he not the very light by which you ask the very question? &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo; is the seed. God (all existence) is the tree.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christ doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk of eternal damnation. Theology does.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qualifications for Vedanta. Viveka - head, vayragya - heart. Be a sisya to the vision. Ready and willing to be instructed. Sisya must have a very clear understanding why is studying Vedanta. He must be done with the world and must want to be uplifted from samsara - life of becoming.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After instructing test the student - &amp;ldquo;who are you my dear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-9-10">Class 9, 10&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Look within, search within. In meditation you look within. This should be made clear to the student.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal of student must be to escape samsara. He must be fed-up with life of becoming. Otherwise they will misuse vedanta.&lt;/strong> Samsari - unhappy with what IS, with the present, no matter what area. He has to change the world. Samsara - a general sense of unsatisfactoriness of it all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The teacher must always love the student. The student might or might not love the teacher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at the moon - you&amp;rsquo;ll become happy without any other reason.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Kastvam asi&lt;/em> - Who are you?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Relationship between Atma and Brahman is identity, not equality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weather also determines people&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of god. Paradise is green because those people were born and raised in a desert.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Should you give up your honest profession to know yourself? No, keep it. Should I give ambition, insensitivity, greed in my profession? Yes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hamsa - jnani. He&amp;rsquo;s a holy hobo. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick to one place. And he&amp;rsquo;s supreme by the power of his knowledge. Western country - hippie. India - sanjasi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsaris take up projects. Cannot digest it, cannot spit it out. Example: a snake with a frog in the mouth. Caught between birth (they love and celebrate) and death (they fear). Samsaris create endless problems for themselves and blame others for them. Nobody can uplift them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your goal must be freedom, then you are a student of Vedanta. Die hard religionist is not different from a die hard worldly person. Difference is in the means by which they pursuit they desires.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In settling your motive you settle the journey and its outcome. Freedom is not doing what you want. That you do anyway. Name for it is independence. Here freedom is psychological freedom - from all desires -&amp;gt; from fear, insecurity, worry -&amp;gt; sense of freedom as one&amp;rsquo;s own svarupa, indefinable, space-like. Moksha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Net of desires is (psychological) time. The moment you desire something you create psychological time and move the heaven outside of now, to future.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vivekananda: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know where from my next square meal will come yet I am not concerned&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acarya: 1) presents the vision of the shastra in very clear terms 2) helps the student to live that vision. 3) lives the vision himself/herself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People who are afraid of death are also afraid of life.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Worldly people: some like dog protecting hay, not using the wealth vs. people having never enough because of costly pleasures. Some balance between these two.&lt;/strong> Religious people not different, also under the illusion of being body and mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Constantly contemplate so that the identification with the body will be resolved. Body will be destroyed, eaten, invaded by diseases &amp;hellip; None of that can happen to myself. You might not be able to change what will happen to the body/mind, but you can always put an end to the imagination of being them. There is wisdom in doing that. Otherwise you are in for some serious trouble as the age comes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swami Omkar (taught only in English): &lt;strong>If you identify with the body, you may do any number of rituals, pilgrimages, charities it will account to zero. If you can disidentify with the body then you need not perform none out of that, you have made it to the highest divinity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ideation. Forming nice ideas about a thing. All study amounts to ideation&amp;hellip; Intellect feels more and more accomplished, acquires a title, gives eloquent speeches about those ideas.&lt;/strong> Idea is always connected with a (set of) words. An idea is never the thing. An idea of god has nothing to do with god. &lt;strong>It is just elaborate Maya&lt;/strong> - Mahamaya [consort of Parabrahman].&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intellectuals - very tough nuts to crack. For them ideation is the goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First step and the most important step of Vedanta (spirituality) - disidentification with the body. Once you are trapped in a sick body, nothing will help you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worldly view: body is the god and religion is providing for the body. Opposite view - harsh religious one (e.g. bhartrhari): body is the tomb of the soul, source of temptation or humiliation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hurting the body to gain favour of god = superstition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you excite the body mind you get a sensation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monstrosity of ignorance and superstition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Right attitude towards body: brother donkey (stupid, lazy, sturdy) - generous indifference. Nobody in his right mind can&amp;rsquo;t hit nor love a donkey. Deserves stick and carrot approach. Put it to good work, keep it going hard, give it good food. Never identify with it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transmigration of the soul - religion. Vedanta - soul is immortal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsara has no beginning. How can it be understood? But if it is repeated a few times - the idea is formed. Just like a pearl is formed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-13-14">Class 13, 14&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Straight line time is mind. Past, present, future. Psychological time. Makes you suffer. Makes things repetitive in life. Makes you meet the present with the ballast of entire past. Meet &amp;hellip; fresh, there is love in it. We should meet life without the intervention of the burden of memory, then whatever it brings is divine.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Circular time is chronological time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t do, you are done.&lt;/strong> Are you doing or are you getting done? What is that is doing you? &lt;strong>Karma (yours). Makes you go round and round.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We inherit thoughts without thinking. Think, explore, contemplate upon it. Then it is not Mr. X&amp;rsquo;s thought, but yours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nature: People get what they deserve. Iswara is like that. Instead of desiring it you deserve.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Examine the joy you get as a result of karmaphala.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are your own guru. &lt;strong>Be a light onto yourself (bhagavan Buddha&amp;rsquo;s last message). If you accept one particular person as your guru, then there is no more learning for you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samsarchakrabamanam - I want to become that. You work for it. You get it. You become disenchanted. REPEAT. Or become disenchanted with it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parable: hamsa (bird) sitting on the rim, becomes disenchanted, moves to the axle and is the sakshi, stable, enjoying the show .&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you do upasana of the smart phone you become as jada as itself. That&amp;rsquo;s why the TV is called the idiot box -&amp;gt; couch potato -&amp;gt; idiotic. Stupid and idiotic describes the mental state of tamoguna.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t go to the guru do get another set of karma and upasana.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s what put you on the wheel in the first place anyway. Proverb in Telugu: if you want to break your head, the stone you are holding is good enough. Examine the karma and upasana. You go to brahmanistha, who&amp;rsquo;s studied extensively and knows the life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sharirat anyaha - I&amp;rsquo;m distinct from the body. The body goes through N changes, but the embodied is not subject to modification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purusha is person, not male, in Vedanta. Male in karmakanda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-knowledge is not making the self the other, but &lt;strong>develop a small space in regard to the body, you have to think (mind) and feel (soul) not as the body.&lt;/strong> This doesn&amp;rsquo;t you have to be harsh, cruel to body - superstitions. Thinking - knowing. Feeling - not emotional feeling, but inner transformation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body goes to places. I am what I am. Always inhere in the heart, don&amp;rsquo;t come, don&amp;rsquo;t go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You worship gods and goddesses that are shaped by your desires and fears. You don&amp;rsquo;t know the real god - that you have to find out.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-15-16---qa">Class 15, 16 - Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Omkara meditation: sit upright. Chant OM while exhaling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If there are no human beings on earth, all other life is there, then there will be no time on earth.&lt;/strong> Time - mental category projected by the human mind. Time - duration of movement from point A to point B.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bonding means being sentimental. It is promoted by the society&lt;/strong> - it is a social morality. Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse between love and bonding. &lt;strong>Love is freedom, there will be no bonding.&lt;/strong> Parents don&amp;rsquo;t know how to love children because they are so &lt;strong>badly attached. Expressing in the form of domination, possessiveness etc. Bonding leads to competition, there will be no learning.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What you call society is in your head. There is no society. Only you are there. Society is samsara.&lt;/strong> Vedanta is not about society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>My world and your world. They are distinct, subjective. You are alone in your world.&lt;/strong> Every world description has a signature on it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In a dream there are other subjects and have their own subjectivity. Dream: projection of the mind without the contribution of sense organs. Waking state: mind + sense organs. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s my enemy&amp;rdquo; - no sense organs involved, entirely dream (subjective). This is a rose - sense organs + mind (subjective). Nothing (objective) is left now, therefore the entire world experience is subjective.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Face life fresh, not through the prism of memory. Don&amp;rsquo;t make people known or unknown to you.&lt;/strong> They are all people. Then life is experience very fresh. &lt;strong>Stop pursuing the future. Give up psychological future. Thumb rule: future is utterly unpredictable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If truth is simple, people don&amp;rsquo;t like it. If truth is complex, people don&amp;rsquo;t digest it. Welcome to samsara.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Living thought (opposite of ideation) is superior to a ton of precept.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ego = identification with the body and believing you are the actor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worshipping God, ancestors (who merge in Ishwara) is for me, not for God nor the departed souls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awareness - cit - knowingness. Like electricity - you can&amp;rsquo;t see it itself but it makes all the things work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Just watch the mind. You are different from it. It cannot play any trick on you unless you allow it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-17-18">Class 17, 18&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Unless you are conscious, there cannot be any idea of beginning. So beginning doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to the consciousness.&lt;/strong> First consciousness, then beginning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The way you think and feel about yourself determines whether you are intelligent or in the grip of Maya (space/time). Do you see yourself as a process?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upadhi - cloak. You are not whatever you wear. When you don&amp;rsquo;t know that, you&amp;rsquo;ll try to dominate the other. You&amp;rsquo;ll appear as a jivaatma (personalized awareness) to yourself. Yet the fact is that you are not a person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you peel all the layers of an onion, boundless space is left. Paramatma (impersonal awareness). Sarvaatma. &lt;strong>Because of Maya you believe you have one body, yet the entire universe is your body.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your personal body is part of prhitvi. Food will become your body. The wheat field is your body, by which it is sustained. Water is constantly getting exchanged with water outside. Therefore when you pollute a river, you pollute your self. Water outside is also your body. There is no boundary between the air outside and inside. Same for fire and akasha.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The personal body comes and goes, the universal body is always there with you. The personal body blinds us so completely that we don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate the universal body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Effort (karma) binds you. You reach sarvaatmabhava by clarity of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are sentimental (about the unreal), then you are under the grip of Maya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>First you sense something what IS. You become conscious of (its) Presence. Then mind comes and is anxious unless it categorizes it (pigeonholes). This is how the mind tricks you. It pushes you until you give a name to the form. Another name for the mind is Maya. When you don&amp;rsquo;t name it everything is Presence (sat).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nama rupa is what covers the truth. It is all superimposition. &lt;strong>Presence is the truth. Mountain is a superimposition. Don&amp;rsquo;t be in a hurry to name it. Mind will learn not to name in time. There will be uninterrupted presence. No cutting into names and forms.&lt;/strong> Presence = brahman = atma = being = yourself. If you would be different from the being you&amp;rsquo;d become sunya.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Better say &amp;ldquo;I is&amp;rdquo;, as the &amp;ldquo;am&amp;rdquo; divides the presence. It is the same presence everywhere. Go beyond the tense also. Drop &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; also, it makes you kind-of personal. Just be. That&amp;rsquo;s what you are - Presence - inside not different from outside.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By associating the Godhead with a physical form, you are insulting the Godhead.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-19-20">Class 19, 20&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lakshana - pointer, as no direct definition of atma is possible. You begin with nama rupa, dismiss them, you arrive at presence (sat, brahman, self). Ornament -&amp;gt; gold.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;existence of nama rupa&amp;rdquo;, they appear, they are not real. If you do, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to dismiss them. &lt;strong>They don&amp;rsquo;t come into existence, nama rupas come into appearance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Just because a name is given, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prove the name. It proves the namelessness. Yet we give the name to make the communication possible.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mind cognizes a particular object by modification. It modifies itself into a particular thought by obtaining the shape of it. Mind is rupa, speech is nama. By hearing a name the mind obtains the shape associated with it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First words, then words and silence, then silence (niddidhiasana). People who say only words and more words remain a bag of bones. If you only start with silence the issue of ignorance won&amp;rsquo;t be addressed. Therefore initially we name atma. Yet sentimental name is not good. So we give a name which is not a name (akasha nama). Generally a name brings a form to the mind. But because a form is not associated with this particular name, the mind resolves. The idea is not to move the mind, because wherever it gets it won&amp;rsquo;t be the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sakshatkara happens in where the shining is, in the atma and not in the mind.&lt;/strong> It happens in between, when the mind is still. Therefore a name (akasha, brahman) is given that isn&amp;rsquo;t associated with a form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The moment you say akAsha the mind becomes silent. It merges in the inner awareness, which is boundless and timeless. &lt;strong>Silence of mind is the harbinger of Brahman.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brahman means &amp;ldquo;bigger than space&amp;rdquo;. Bigger than the biggest. Brahman is spaceless (space-abhava upalakshitam brahman - pointer to brahman). Satyam is always pointed out by abhava. You cannot point out directly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moksha, &lt;strong>Brahman is also called Shanti. Shanti = ashanti dismissed. Any number of ashanti is created by mind, e.g. from anxiety or seeking pleasure.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the category of nama rupa, which are mithya. Whatever you are familiar with, is unreal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When somebody says something, you only get hurt when you identify with the body.&lt;/strong> Nothing can hurt you. You are asarira. You are not the body, you don&amp;rsquo;t own the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Holistic, threefold health. Physical. Mental - mind is quiet, not agitated, not worried. You don&amp;rsquo;t get agitated by what others say or do. Spiritual - you do not identify with the physical body (and mind, pancha koshas). I&amp;rsquo;m not the one who can be drowned by water, who can be burned by fire. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In atma there is no punyam no papam. They are in vijnanamaya kosha. That is what transmigrates. A criminal has the same atma as a saint.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ganga - flowers come and go. Dead bodies come and go. Same for punya papa. No trace of those sticks with you. They can never affect you. Jiva is essentially asamsari, just like Ishvara (there is no difference), only by ignorance he is a samsari. Your nature is divinity only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sakshi (Brahman, yourself) knows. Sakshi doesn&amp;rsquo;t require pratyaksha (direct seeing) and anumana (inference - thinking). Mind is closest to the atma. States of the mind known to the mind is aparoksha knowing, they are known directly by perceiving (experiencing). Sakshi knows itself by being (itself) - sakshataparoksham. No pramana required. Role of sastra is just to tell what you are not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You don&amp;rsquo;t know atma by any pramana. You know atma by being.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="class-1">Class 1&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Yoga, gym&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t neglect the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practical Vedanta with impact on life, not academical. Not sub-serving a system, method, formula. You can&amp;rsquo;t have both. No prioritization, just one goal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intellect - tool for knowing - pair of tongs. Self-enquiry instead of self-knowledge&lt;/strong>. Tongs cannot catch themselves. You can only be yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who are you? You are not looking for the answer but staying with the question. Where from comes the answer? Mind. &lt;strong>Whatever the mind knows is ignorance, not knowledge.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppose you know the self. Then it becomes the other.&lt;/strong> It is not only unknown but also unknowable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uncompromising scriptures: Upadesha Sahasri, Yoga Vashista and Ashtavakra Gita&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ashtavakra is outspoken. Of present times only Ramakrishna can be compared to him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aham prakurute paraha&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you are loving, quiet, peaceful you are not conscious of your mind. You are only when it is sick. Same with the body.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-2">Class 2&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In belief there are no questions, no inquiry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t find happiness, health, love, yourself, God outside of you. You have to search, you cannot hand over the responsibility to someone else, e.g. guru. You are your own guru.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only healthy body will allow you to search/go beyond the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1st step in Vedanta - disidentification with the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maze of verbal expressions vs. reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conduct daily exercise in discrimination. Look at yourself as something beyond physical body. It is enough to know what you are not. Inhale - I&amp;rsquo;m not the body. Exhale - I&amp;rsquo;m not the mind. Train feeling (bhava), not thinking: aham prakurute parah -&amp;gt; brahmanhood. Aham shantaha. Sit upright, allow the mind the become silent. That silence is you. &lt;strong>When the mind becomes noisy, I&amp;rsquo;m not there. Then tell it shantoham.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prakuturi = changeful.&lt;/strong> You are the same in childhood, adulthood and old age while your body and mind is not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion of the masses vs. &lt;strong>true religion - &lt;em>aham prakurute paraha&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Noisy, extroverted people cannot be silent, they hope this commotion provides some distraction from their own inner misery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inner light: I am and I know that I am. &lt;em>Aham bodhaha&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-3">Class 3&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Religion, belief, followers -&amp;gt; leader. Following, believing is easy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thinking reserved for artha, kama, dharma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wild crane vs. a parrot in a golden cage. Freedom vs. security. Uncertainty, you don&amp;rsquo;t know what will be your next move. You cannot call nothing your own. Do you love that? You are called mumukshu.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I provoke you to think. I point out the malaise that has taken root in our lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without knowing oneself there is no basis for thinking, speaking, acting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove layers of ignorance. Know yourself, starting with the body, then the mind&amp;hellip; -&amp;gt; joy of self-realization: freedom, lightness in life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Body - brother donkey. Approach with generous indifference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Even when somebody wakes you up from deep sleep, don&amp;rsquo;t lose sight of your true nature. In your thinking you should always know yourself correctly. Aham bodhaha (awareness).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bliss - it is there but you cannot describe it. No difference between a happy and desperate man in deep sleep.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Which is superior? The costly diamond or the light of awareness in which I see it as diamond. Delusion: belief that the diamond I see is costlier.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You do all what is supposed to be done by a father. But never believe you are a father. You are Brahman. (controlled folly)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-4">Class 4&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Moha - delusion, taking something for something else. Projection - seeing things that are not there.&lt;/strong> Snake/rope - seeing something outside that is created in the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ignorance: All sorrow comes from self-forgetfulness, from giving importance to the outer thing. Desiring it leads to fear. When the thing is lost, you have not lost anything.&lt;/strong> This is how we get deluded. This is how we put ourselves in a painful state.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wisdom: Be alert. Look at yourself. The thing moves out of focus and does not appear valuable any more. The question of desiring it does not arise.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Biggest delusion is thinking that happiness, which is your birthright, comes from the outside, e.g. wealth, other people. This is attachment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mortgaged happiness: In a given relationship you experience sorrow because you expect to derive happiness from that relation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Origin of (Hindu) pilgrimage: illusion that God is outside of you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Difference jnani and samsari. Jnani says all are my people or none is my people. Samsari says some few are my people. Same for world. Like a dream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are afraid of the world because it appears to be alien to them. Only a small part is me/mine. They are in opposition to the rest. &lt;strong>Samsari&amp;rsquo;s world is a fragmented world. The world is produced by his own imagination. It&amp;rsquo;s a personal world. Hanging by a thread of memory.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mine -&amp;gt; fragmentation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bhava = (inner) feeling. Sarvaatmabhava - the entire world is myself = state of realization. Before that vivekabhava = state of seeking -&amp;gt; Nothing is mine.&lt;/strong> Aham ekaha. For waking state just like in a dream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta - universal philosophy, not Indian philosophy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Body shines i.e. becomes evident. The way I illuminate the body the same way I illuminate the world.&lt;/strong> The same way this body becomes known in the quality of knowingness the same way the world becomes known. First you become aware of the body, then of the sensations, thoughts, emotions, then knowledge in the intellect and then of the awareness itself. That is you and that you illuminates both the body and the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Body and the world come together. You cannot have the one without the other.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-5">Class 5&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aho = wonder. We gradually lose it. You the person lose yourself in it. When there is wonder, there is communion. There is only the knowing, there is only oneness. That wonder is called bhakti - devotion - wonder in the heart. Once you convert the wonder into an experience (sensorial and mental) and want to repeat it you lose it. Division is created and the act becomes mechanical.&lt;/strong> No wonder, enthusiasm is left. We convert the devotion, wisdom, reverence into a mechanical ritual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Camera converts the present into past so you can enjoy it in future. Present is destroyed. Converts the reality into nama rupa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wonder - my prayer.&lt;/strong> That is the true religion, not the religion of the masses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world and the body - you cannot have the one without the other. They come and sink together. Water and the wave. Movie and the lens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You have space/time only when there is a human mind to project it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look at the tree in a way so that the mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t interfere. With a suspended mind you are not looking at a particular tree. Mind more quiet - you are not looking at a tree at all. Subject object division collapses. You are not a person any longer. You are a person looking at a tree only when the thing seen is a tree. There is only seeing. &lt;strong>Quiet mind -&amp;gt; nama rupas are not projected. You are a Presence, the tree is a Presence and somehow there is no division.&lt;/strong> The thing you are looking at is not the other, it is the same Being that you yourself are. That is called Advaita.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When I take myself to be the body mind there springs a world before me - &lt;em>sa šaríram ahó višvam&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong> Ramana Maharshi: The world comes into being when I wake up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rama running after the golden deer - chasing nama rupas. Stop chasing&lt;/strong> [unlearning].&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attributed human -&amp;gt; human -&amp;gt; human consciousness -&amp;gt; living consciousness -&amp;gt; consciousness = being absolute.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Killing the present: name is the past, the thing in itself is the present. Name comes from the mind&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Immediate perception - do not allow any definition (division) of the mind to intervene. Just pure awareness. Just be (yourself). Don&amp;rsquo;t be this or that. (Spiritual) ego has no basis without the world around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot give up the nama rupa called world by keeping your own nama rupa.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Allow, don&amp;rsquo;t force, the mind to become quiet and it will.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He did not believe in God because he knew God. I&amp;rsquo;m always in communion with the God. If you see God in you, you see God everywhere. In your own Presence God is present. You do not arrive at God with positive effort but by psychologically giving up all - dismissing the unreal - vivekabhava.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-6">Class 6&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>God is the light by which you perceive (fivefold) the world. Appears as little spark &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo; when conditioned by body/mind&lt;/strong>, which is at the beginning and end of every cognition (knowing). Cleanse mentally of imagined limitations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In dualism otherness persists. Attractive for the mind because thinking requires a lot of energy. People prefer to believe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Space and time - continuum. You cannot have one without the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learnings vs. wanting and waiting to be told. Subject vs. object. Living entity vs. dead. Taking vs. giving away responsibility for oneself. While you are learning there is no gurudom in it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being - appearing. Water - waves. Wave, whirlpool, foam etc. is looking at water through the prism of space and time. Looking directly all is water only.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nothing is really born.&lt;/strong> AjAtavAda from mandukya. Child was, is, will be. &lt;strong>Human mind gives the birth.&lt;/strong> If you don&amp;rsquo;t accept the birth, where are the causes for it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Atma alone is, everything else appears.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Idea of the rose comes from the head. You say plant caused (given birth to) the rose. &lt;strong>The rose is not what is there, the rose is what you project. The rose is in your memory. A person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know rose never sees rose.&lt;/strong> Rose comes from the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Consciousness in movement is called mind. Mind is thoughts (waves) and it&amp;rsquo;s background is the consciousness (lake). What you call rose is but rose consciousness. Rose is = rose consciousness is.&lt;/strong> Everything that you perceive as though outside is in your consciousness. What you call outside is also in your consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Entire movie and sentiments is in your head. Mind is the film. Screen is the canvas, space/time. You are the light, intercepted by the mind.&lt;/strong> Whatever you see is outside of the body but not outside the consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta is examining, investigating, not being told. Dumb students need to be told. Even pashu need not to be told.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you see a rose you give the birth to a rose.&lt;/strong> When you stop seeing it is not there at all. &lt;strong>A thing is only when you are conscious of it. You are the author of this universe. The universe is not separate from you: &lt;em>Višvam atmanaha na binnam&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>višvam = world. vi - many, manifold. šva - cognised.&lt;/strong> World is what is congnised by the five senses. Outside, inside both is in your consciousness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dark room with a pot. When you turn on the switch, what will you see? Whatever was not there earlier. Always you see the light. You never ever see the pot. Pot is in your head.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is outside is vibration, what you hear is sound (interpretation by human being).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The entire universe is seen, therefore jada. The one who is looking at it, who perceives is chetana. The God you worship is hopefully chetana. Look for it in yourself, not in jada. Hanuman doesn&amp;rsquo;t find Sita in the beautiful Sri Lanka, but in the heart - Ashokavanam.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-7">Class 7&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Angiras: by knowing which everything else is known? Know yourself. A drop of ocean is in front of you. Know all about it and you will know all about the ocean. &lt;strong>A drop of ocean is everything the ocean is&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideation vs. knowledge. The word is not the thing (word is outside, idea/concept is inside).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideation (in Vedanta) might be just the obstacle to understand the situation, realize what is the truth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Set aside the so called knowledge from the head, make consciousness empty and be alert. Realization: ideation -&amp;gt; actuality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heaven = post mortem gratification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moksha according to Shankara = sarvaatmabhaava. Begins with vivekabhaava.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta = transformation in consciousness, not ideation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you practice true religion, you&amp;rsquo;ll be alone or have two, three people around you. Religion of the masses - we want masses around.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unless there is a sense of separation you don&amp;rsquo;t get that identification (religious identity).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vasudhaiva kutumbakam - entire humanity is my family.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Indian -&amp;gt; human being -&amp;gt; conscious being -&amp;gt; being. I&amp;rsquo;m the existence which is the existence of all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as you believe that you are born into the world and will leave the world behind so long you will not know yourself correctly. &lt;strong>When you wake up the world springs into existence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amrtasya putraha - you are the offspring of immortality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meditate: World is uphold by your consciousness. When you are going to sleep, you devour the entire universe. Whatever appears shines in my light of awareness. I&amp;rsquo;m all that appears in the concsiousness. Feel this. You are born when you identify with the body. Understanding this is the aim of true religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Clean your heart by driving away malaise, jealousy. You see somebody with good health/luck/etc. -&amp;gt; god bless them! There is no friend, there is no foe and there is only divinity which is myself. Love all as yourself, forgive your enemies.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-8">Class 8&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rajjusarpa: &lt;strong>When there is ignorance of the real, the false makes an appearance.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you are afraid of something, that thing will be in your thoughts -&amp;gt; worship. Snake - Vishnu, Shiva. What you are afraid, you&amp;rsquo;ll see everywhere.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>When you face a snake, you don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem. You do what is appropriate. That is intelligence, not fear. Imagined snake - problem, fear.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Horoscope - fear. Chart reading - new religion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Word &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo; brings only fear in human mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People are afraid of both death and life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more wealth you accumulate the more insecure you become.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In familial, social, religious live we are driven by fear. It has many shades: insecurity, worry, anxiety. Show me a person free from anxiety and I will show you an atmajnani.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If there is fear, the other person cannot solve it for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Self-enclosing egocentric activities generate a lot of anxiety. Self-enclosing activity is one that generates some advantage for the apparent self.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are not too many wise people in the world. They do not adorn robes of a guru or a priest. They remain quiet without a lot of fanfare.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Apparent self (center of a circle) is ever changing and mortal, real self is never changing and the self of all (incl. of vegetable and mineral kingdom).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ajnana is the single source of insecurity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mahatma + Brahmaaksasa (=jagat) story: you cannot eat me. You can eat the body. I&amp;rsquo;m not the body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you fight the truth, you&amp;rsquo;re always the loser.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You see all these divisions because you are yourself divided inside. If you are integrated within, you&amp;rsquo;ll see integration outside as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-9">Class 9&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Seeing the truth might be difficult and inconvenient - like a person accustomed to darkness seeing the light. There is a sense of security remaining in the darkness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vedanta has nothing to do with religion, Vedanta is beyond religion (karma and upasana). Vedanta is looking at yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no urgency, immediacy, eagerness to know the true self. People have petty issues and are looking for answers for these. Truth can wait. Rise above &amp;hellip; samsara has its own dynamic, it will not become perfect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Relationships - main sources of suffering. Obsession with body, relationships, world are main obstacles to self-knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guru is the pointing finger. Those who worship the pointing finger miss the moon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mirror with a golden frame. What are you interested in? Outside beauty or beauty in your heart?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Essence of gurudom - &lt;strong>waiting to be told -&amp;gt; losing the sharpness of mind&lt;/strong>. Learning instinct is not there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Learn to look at yourself correctly. Not as the body / mind = original sin in christian mysticism (avidya - hinduism, dukha - buddhism). Identify with Atma = heaven&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suppose that you know what you are. Then what you know becomes the other. Are you the other? Know what you are not. You know yourself by being yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You cannot see sunlight. What you see the daylight - sunlight reflected in the atmosphere. You can only infer the sunlight. Pot shines because of the daylight because of the sunlight.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the body mind. It is the mind that makes you worry. Go beyond. The less obsessed you are about the body, the healthier it will be.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t life in the past which is dead, don&amp;rsquo;t life future which is not yet. &lt;strong>Live in the eternal present.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chronological time vs. psychological time vs. timeless. As long as you are identified with the mind, you are in time. Timeless is by not identifying with the body/mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowing / learning is never in the future. It is always in the present. Moksha will not come! Process, methodology are in time. Knowing is timeless, doing in time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t be caught in the flow of the mind all the time. Step back, do not identify. Just watch. Be not happy, unhappy about some particular thought patterns. You&amp;rsquo;ve crossed the barrier of mind and thus time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entire universe shines because of the inner light of awareness -&amp;gt; you are the origin of the universe. When the inner light (sun) shines, the whole universe (world) shines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-10">Class 10&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Only when you perceive, the world exists.&lt;/strong> A thing only exists, when it is known to a conscious being. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley">George Berkeley&lt;/a> - &lt;strong>esse is percipi - objects, nothing doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist outside of the mind because it&amp;rsquo;s the senses that &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; their existence.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Vedanta we &lt;strong>don&amp;rsquo;t say world exists. We say jagat bhati - world shines&lt;/strong> (svetlo -&amp;gt; svet svieti, jagat - jagať). Loka - the world is that which you look at.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is is and what you see is something else. &lt;strong>What IS is spaceless. What you see is spacebound.&lt;/strong> Infinite, substratum cannot be perceived - no difference to be perceived. That&amp;rsquo;s why Brahman is formless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wealth - source of endless suffering and conflict in life. There should be no proactive accumulation. Proactively you should prevent the accumulation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Space/time &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; is provided by the senses and inference - snake, dream, movie = illusion, entertainment. Unchanging reality - rope, screen, observer. &lt;strong>The secret of the entertainment is that you never lose touch with the ground reality.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Realization - seeing the false as false. Then you become free of the false, free of sorrow and fear. And the real remains real in its glory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Screen - sat, light - cit. Film - mind, canvas - space/time. Adhisthanam for the vishvam - the inner light.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be a teacher to yourself. Atma - satguru. &lt;strong>Whenever you face distress, just sit upright and look at yourself. Learn to look at yourself&lt;/strong> - antarmukhatham - fundation of vedantic knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ideation happens in such a perfect way that you even don&amp;rsquo;t know that you are a victim of ideation. Iota of realization &amp;gt; ton of precept.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Maru (desert) mareechika (sunlight) - only buddhi will save the deer, not what he perceives (i.e. illusion). Human beings = thirsty deer&lt;/strong>. We make Gods accomplices to our greed. They can favour us not by reorganizing the world according to our taste but by giving some sense to us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ask yourself - &amp;ldquo;am I chasing something?&amp;rdquo; Stop chasing! Shame upon you that you have to chase something.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="class-11">Class 11&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Transmigration of the soul, all beliefs regarding birth and death - religion. Not part of Vedanta. Atma is immortal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As long as you believe you come into this world and leave it you will not know your true nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are the Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra. The world comes out of you. In every moment there is Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>First you wake up, like Vishnu and then start creating things. The first thing you create - &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;. Then identify the self-existence with the body. That creates space and time. And then you create the world (this is my house, wife, career etc.).&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everything starts and ends with the primordial sense of &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no common world. Every world description has a signature upon it. Occasionally there is overlapping.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You are the master of your destiny. If it is a lousy world you created, you can make it into a beautiful, happy one. The world you are living in has the origin in you.&lt;/strong> This is Vedanta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Matter is what appears in you. It is consciousness only, light. And it is the human concsiousness that creates everything. I am the creator.&lt;/strong> If you find yourself creating strife &amp;hellip; why not create harmony? You can create what you want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The world is a glittering and empty show and you are the showmaster. The world is by your consent. You have the authority to be what you want to be. World is not (real). Gold alone is, ornaments are not. Without your imagination, there is no world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My wife, children, career, friend, enemy &amp;hellip; just my imaginations. &lt;strong>World is the conviction that you are conscious of a world.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rose, game, harmony, space &amp;hellip; is not outside but in your head. Each is just a &lt;strong>bunch of sensations that is converted by the brain into what we believe to be an external object.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop identifying with the body and you&amp;rsquo;ll understand you&amp;rsquo;re the cradle that holds the entire universe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If there is no original sin, you don&amp;rsquo;t have a humankind, world. Children don&amp;rsquo;t have a world.&lt;/strong> They cry when hungry, sleep when tired, otherwise they are quiet and happy - &lt;strong>mind has not yet started projecting&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Imagination &amp;ldquo;produces&amp;rdquo; things, attachment gives reality to them. Precondition: ajnanam. Cut of both imagination and attachment and see what remains. You&amp;rsquo;re the Shesha. Jnanam is like fire. Fire convertes ornaments into gold.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Truth is always simple. Complex = unreal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nabhi - navel. Nabha - space. Vishnu (I) -&amp;gt; navel (center, space) -&amp;gt; lotus (earth) - Brahma (human being). 4 heads -&amp;gt; 4 vedas -&amp;gt; speech -&amp;gt; mind (origin of speech; movement in concsiousness, movement = Brahma) -&amp;gt; consciousness (Vishnu). speech = word. word = creation&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;m the Vishnu, creator is the Brahma, the mind. Vishnu didn&amp;rsquo;t create this world, Brahma did. Prostrations to myself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&amp;hellip; &lt;em>u nekonečne dlhej cesty sa nedá pokúsiť o nič viac, ako nájsť jej začiatok a stanoviť jej smer. Predstieranie, že cesta je pochopená a dokončená, je prinajmenšom klamaním samého seba. Jednotlivý študent na nej môže dosiahnuť dokonalosti iba v subjektívnom slova zmysle a vyprávať o nej môže iba tak, že povie všetko, čo bol schopný zhliadnuť.&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; Georg Simmel&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zorba the Greek (1964)</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-09-14-zorba_the_greek/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-09-14-zorba_the_greek/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I went for it all. Wife, house, children. The full catastrophe.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Life is trouble. To be alive is to undo your belt and look for trouble.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Good or bad, what is the difference? They all end up the same way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A man needs a little madness or else he never dares to cut the rope and be free.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>“This is true happiness: to have no ambition and to work like a horse as if you had every ambition. To live far from men, not to need them and yet to love them. To have the stars above, the land to your left and the sea to your right and to realize of a sudden that in your heart, life has accomplished its final miracle: it has become a fairy tale.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Awareness: Wake Up to Life</title><link>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-09-03-de_mello_awareness/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://uzak.github.io/post/2019-09-03-de_mello_awareness/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here are some notes from Anthony de Mello&amp;rsquo;s program &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRREgz-K8Io">Awareness: Wake Up To Life, New York, 1986&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="on-waking-up">On waking up&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All mystics agree: &lt;strong>all is well. If you don&amp;rsquo;t see it, you are asleep.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People don&amp;rsquo;t want to be cured, they want relief. &lt;strong>Cure (waking up) is painful. Wise guru will never attempt to wake people up.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="will-i-be-able-to-help-you">Will I be able to help you&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t expect neither to help nor to damage you. You did it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You are never in love with anyone. You are in love with your prejudiced, hopeful idea of the person.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t trust anyone, you trust your judgements about the person -&amp;gt; blame on other: &amp;ldquo;how could you let me down?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t try to make them happy. You only get into trouble. Banana in the ear parable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="on-the-proper-kind-of-selfishness">On the proper kind of selfishness&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;d rather be happy than have you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="on-wanting-happiness">On wanting happiness&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t want to be unconditionally happy. We are ready to be happy provided&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love = freedom = peace = joy = happiness = spirituality (i.e. the most practical thing)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="on-psychology">On psychology&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Psychology - relief&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People have to suffer enough emotionally before they are ready to wake up. It&amp;rsquo;s only when they are sick of their sickness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There must be a better way (than depending on &amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Johny and cow dung parable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sign of waking up: Q: &amp;ldquo;Am I crazy or are all of them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every new idea when it began was in the minority of one, or as blasphemy. E.g.: Jesus, Buddha.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step 1) realize you don&amp;rsquo;t want to wake up&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="neither-is-renunciation-the-answer">Neither is renunciation the answer&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Renunciation is delusion. It ties you to the object of renunciation. You give it as much power as you use to fight it. Receive your daemons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="listen-and-unlearn">Listen and unlearn&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Agreement and disagreement don&amp;rsquo;t matter - have to do with words, not with Truth. Truth has to do with attitude (of openness), then it will be sighted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Truth can&amp;rsquo;t be described, only what is not - illusions. Neti Neti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All I can do is help you to unlearn.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you listening to get confirmation for what you already think? Or to discover something new?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>belief - security vs. faith - insecurity. Faith: open, ready to listen, ready to follow, not knowing where it leads you, no matter what is the consequences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faith doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to be stupid - challenge what you hear. Buddha: monks and scholar must not accept my words out of respect but analyze them like a goldsmith does with gold.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Step 2) readiness to listen, understand and challenge your belief system. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve got the wrong ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-masquerade-of-charity">The masquerade of charity&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>even your most selfless acts are masquerading as altruism. self-centeredness #1 pleasing myself, #2 pleasure of pleasing others - more refined selfishness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A good is never so good as when you are not aware you are doing good. Sufis: a saint is one until he/she knows it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Less worthy motives - awful. Worthy ones - selfish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acting based on pure feeling vs based on the idea of myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The same process is used to produce a saint Francis Xavier and a terrorist. Brainwashing: full of flame, zero awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are doing something for the love of anybody in your self interest - it does give you a good feeling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-centeredness #3: some people do things not to feel guilty and call it charity. It gives you a bad feeling if you don&amp;rsquo;t do it -&amp;gt; you have no guts to say &amp;ldquo;no! I want to be left alone&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We love hurting people, we just don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it ourselves because we will be hurt in return.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whats-on-your-mind">What&amp;rsquo;s on your mind?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Life is a banquet but most people don&amp;rsquo;t see it and are starving. We are surrounded in happiness, joy, love. Repent (wake up) and accept the good news. You&amp;rsquo;ve committed your sins because you were at sleep anyway. Put on a new mind!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brainwashing: introjecting (other peoples&amp;rsquo;) ideas. Funny: you&amp;rsquo;ll be ready to die for them. Do you react emotionally, feel stunned when they are attacked -&amp;gt; sign of brainwashing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manure parable: &amp;ldquo;how old should be the horse?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attach yourself to reality instead of ideas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not Jack. So you&amp;rsquo;ve changed your name&amp;rdquo; parable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All your good deeds sprang from self interested. Maybe your neighbour has coarser taste - but it is the same thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most difficult people (for Jesus to deal with) were those who were convicted how good they were.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="cd-2">CD 2&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="good-bad-or-lucky">Good, bad, or lucky?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stop feeling bad. We&amp;rsquo;re all the same. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jesus was so much at home with sinners because he understood that he&amp;rsquo;s not a bit better. The only difference is in what we do, not what we are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pharisee is not evil, he&amp;rsquo;s just stupid.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="our-illusion-about-others">Our illusion about others&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You choose not to see through people, to see them in bright colours, because you chose not to see through yourself&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Enlightenment is when you are ready to exchange your dreams for facts.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;There is nothing you can do about it but wake up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you want it too badly, you are in big trouble.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are enlightened? What does it matter?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What do you hope for? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just another form of desire?&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="self-observation">Self-observation&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The only thing someone can be of help to you is in challenging your ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What you can do yourself is self-observation. Watch yourself, as if it were happening to someone else. There is no method, no technique.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s painful to see your illusions shattered.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s what repentance is all about&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>remembering - memory, awareness - attention.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>awareness of negative feelings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>understand that the &lt;strong>feeling is in you, not in reality.&lt;/strong> No person on earth, no event has the power to make you unhappy, disturb or hurt you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>never identify with the feeling. -&amp;gt; depression is there. Not: I&amp;rsquo;m depressed. It is not an essential part of I. Same with horny, angry etc. your depression and your kicks have nothing to do with your happiness. Fight, do your duty but keep your heart at the lotus feet of the lord (unaffected).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>understand, that when you change everything changes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h2 id="sleepwalking">Sleepwalking&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Swing into action, but not to get rid of your negative feeling. It is not by your actions that you will be saved/enlightened, but by your Being, by what you are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We see people and things not as they are but as we are! The world is as we feel. The day you are different, you&amp;rsquo;ll see them different. She seems so rude -&amp;gt; I feel frightened.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="change-as-greed">Change as greed&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything. &lt;strong>The more you do the worse it gets. All you have to do is understand.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have no right to make any demand on any person. I&amp;rsquo;ll protect myself from consequences of your actions, but you can be whatever you choose to be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lunatic: You better do as I expect you to or else I shall have negative feelings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do it enjoyable, not well. Village orchestra parable (competition).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Part of waking up is to live your life as you see it fits you. The selfishness lies lies in demanding that someone else lives his life as it suits you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What will happen when we wake up? Why bother?! You&amp;rsquo;ll make it a goal and you&amp;rsquo;ll be determined to get there and you&amp;rsquo;ll say I refuse to be happy until I&amp;rsquo;m awakened.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s OK the be the way you are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parable: student writing letters to Guru about what he understands&amp;hellip; Until he stops. After a long time he inquires and the students answers: &amp;ldquo;what does it matter?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="a-changed-person">A changed person&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>As you identify less and less with &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; you are more at ease with everybody and everything. You are no longer afraid of being hurt, not liked, being left. You no longer desire to impress anyone. You don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to explain yourself, apologize (after all, what are you expecting from an ass?).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody rejects/accepts you. They reject whatever they think you are. It&amp;rsquo;s your responsibility if you pick that up.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="losing-the-rat-race">Losing the rat race&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Losing the self: ever tried to lose something? &lt;strong>You lose, when you are not trying. You are never so centered on your self, as when you are depressed.&lt;/strong> You are never so ready as to forget yourself, when you are happy. Happiness releases you from the self.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To die to the self is to understand its true nature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God: I am he who is. You are she/he who is not. God is the dancer, creation is the dance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To lose the self is to suddenly realise that you are not what you thought to be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prepare the ground for the loss of the self: &lt;strong>disassociate yourself with the transient things.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="permanent-worth">Permanent worth&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Worldly success&lt;/strong> - fragile, transitory. &lt;strong>How we are reflected in the mirror of other peoples&amp;rsquo; minds.&lt;/strong> One understands one&amp;rsquo;s worth when one no longer identifies in term of transient things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blessed experiences make life delightful, painful experiences lead to growth. use negative feelings for understanding, watching it from outside, to disassociate from it - cut the connection with it. after some time it might not come at all, but it won&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>State of wakefulness - state where you drop desires, cravings (unless I get what I desire, I refuse to be happy), i.e. their fulfillment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="desire-not-preference">Desire not preference&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Suppress desires -&amp;gt; become lifeless, without energy. Desire = energy. Suppressing desire - being tied to it.&lt;/strong> Understand it, transform it into a preference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Happiness, dropping illusions - seeing things not as I (me) am but as they are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every time you are unhappy, you have added something to the reality. Reality provides the stimulus, you provide the reaction. You&amp;rsquo;ve added something. Demand, expectation, craving.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changing the world won&amp;rsquo;t change you. Changing the pen won&amp;rsquo;t change your handwriting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is change, flow. If you want to live, you must have no permanent abode, no place to rest your head. The one who would be constant in happiness must frequently change. The whole enjoyment of the symphony lies in your readiness to allow the notes to pass. Parable of Nasruding playing a guitar with one string.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="clinging-to-illusion">Clinging to illusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you cling, life gets destroyed. &lt;strong>When you hold on to anything, you cease to live&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A thrill comes from the fulfillment of a desire, craving. It brings anxiety. Sooner or later it brings its hangover. Feeding yourself with thrills - feeding a racehorse with cake and wine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Illusion: it is important, natural to be important, to belong, to love. Natural is to be free, to love.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You become happy with contact with reality, not by being desired, important, loved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;You are a genius.&amp;rdquo; If you give reality to it, you will have to live up to it. Smash it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life is what happens to us while we are busy making other plans.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="hugging-memories">Hugging memories&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An inner change always registers in your eyes, face, body.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Looking at the people, world through the fixed picture of prejudice. You are more likely to respond accurately, when you see clearly. Do you really see someone you are attached to or you are afraid of? The emotion gets in the way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m conditioned, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a shopping list inside. So when I meet the person I fall in love (= desire). And you see her after you have married her. That&amp;rsquo;s when love might begin.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Addiction is blind, love is clear-sighted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every concept that was meant to help to get in touch with reality ends up becoming a barrier to reality. Unless you realise that the word is not the thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="getting-concrete">Getting concrete&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Concept - you have the same word for all the individuals. Example: leafs on tree. Great for finding similarities, communication, indication, science. It gives you an idea what it is not. Whatever IS is found concrete. Krishnamurthi: The day you teach the child the word for the bird he will cease to see the bird.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Concept is always static/frozen. Reality flows (is movement, action, change).&lt;/strong> Watch! Look. Get in touch with things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reality is whole, words and concepts fragment reality. Each language cuts reality differently (e.g. difficult translation of &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Concept, idea, word, thought (fragment) vs. vision, intuition (whole).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Concept is abstract, reality is concrete.&lt;/strong> Concept is help to lead you to reality, but is not the thing -&amp;gt; idolatry. Concept - true and FALSE at the same time. Experience reality. God is a mystery: there is no words for reality (that is beyond words and concepts). The task of theologians is to explain everything through God and explain God as unexplainable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If words can&amp;rsquo;t really describe what is experienced how much more difficult is to use them to explain the experiencer (Vedanta).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Thanks to concepts we develop intelligence&lt;/strong>, which in due time can see its own limitations. Become not children but LIKE children. We have to fall from the stage of innocence, to develop &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; thanks to concepts and then to be redeemed and to to paradise. Put off the old man and return to the state of the child without being children anymore. We start by looking at reality in wonder, but not the &lt;strong>intelligent wonder of a mystic&lt;/strong> but the formless wonder of a child. Wonder -&amp;gt; boredom (along with language, concepts) -&amp;gt; wonder.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>One never quarrels about reality, we only quarrel about opinions, judgements.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t seek for truth, drop you prejudices, concepts, judgements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ultimate knowledge of God: to know, that we do not know God. Neti-neti. Via negativa. Even our questions about God are absurd. C.S.Lewis: &amp;ldquo;Q: How many minutes are there in the colour yellow. A: 25 carrots.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lose beliefs and come to faith. Sometimes the best thing for awakening is a tragedy to struck us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our tragedy is that we think we know, so we never discover.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="cultural-conditioning">Cultural conditioning&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are thousands of powerful words (concepts) that correspond to nothing (e.g. a country). Tree vs. India. Yet they have the power to trigger emotions in us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Part of our liberation is liberation from our country - cultural conditioning. They teach you to be proud of your country. Wear your culture like you wear your clothes. Don&amp;rsquo;t identify.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not being able (to not give alms, etc) - compulsion, mechanical. The beauty doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from a habit (programming, past experiences etc.) but from sensitivity, clarity of perception and accuracy of response.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Passing through the eye of the needle - &lt;strong>little baggage:&lt;/strong> Experience something fully, then drop it and experience new moment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awareness -&amp;gt; understanding &amp;hellip; imagine a human giving you always a fair deal, uninfluenced by words but only by reality.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="filtered-reality">Filtered reality&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We are constantly getting feedback from reality. But we filter it - by our conditioning, culture, past experience&amp;hellip; So you see things that are not there or don&amp;rsquo;t see things that are there - paranoid person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Root of sorrow - craving, attachment. Fear and desires distort and destroy perception.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Programmed to unhappiness: when we were young we were drugged to need people and are trading reality for acceptance, approval, appreciation, success&amp;hellip; Script (for creating attachments): until you get this object, you cannot be happy. When you get it you have to work to keep it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You gain the world, but lose your soul to non-existent things: power, prestige, winning, popularity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is only one way out. Deprogramming. How? Become aware of programming. You cannot change by an effort of the will, ideals, building new habits. Your behaviour might, but you won&amp;rsquo;t. You only change through awareness and understanding. When you see a stone as a stone and not as a diamond.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="detachment">Detachment&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We are striving to reorganize the world (which is always changing) to keep our attachment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prison of programming, fantasies. Happiness is a state of non-illusion. Freedom - drop the baggage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are going anxious, angry? Your attachment has been threatened.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercise: &lt;strong>imagine something you are attached to and say to it: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t need you to be happy. I&amp;rsquo;m only deluding myself into the belief that without you I won&amp;rsquo;t be happy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My favourite place is somewhere else. Be here and now. And when now goes, let it go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where awareness comes in, programming goes. Programming (recipes) is opposite of awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We view people through our attachments. Only when you are able to tell your best friend I don&amp;rsquo;t need you - you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to enjoy his company thoroughly. Attachment destroys our capacity to love. Love - sensitivity, consciousness, clarity of perception.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="addictive-love">Addictive love&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>How can you love people when you (emotionally) need people? You can only use them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I can only love people when I die to to the people, when I&amp;rsquo;m in the desert. Loneliness -&amp;gt; Solitude. Desert begins to flower.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Somebody is angry with me -&amp;gt; we think something is wrong with me, but actually there is something wrong with you.&lt;/strong> You&amp;rsquo;re having a tantrum? I don&amp;rsquo;t have any desire to rescue you.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>You can be happy in your tension. Before enlightenment I was getting depressed, after I get depressed. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it a goal, e.g. people getting tense trying to relax.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The harder you are trying to change yourself, the worse it will get. Come to reality, to senses.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>resist not evil - when someone strikes you on the left cheek offer the right as well. &lt;strong>You always empower the demons you fight. Understand (incl. consequences), don&amp;rsquo;t renounce.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Violence might change your behaviour, but never you. Understanding, insight provides easy change, there is no residue of violence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="assorted-landmines">Assorted landmines&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>To doubt (to question) is infinitely more important than to adore (to believe) -&amp;gt; brainwashing. Doubt is a healing bar, thought it will burn at first it will heal you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As soon as you start thinking as a (communist, catholic, &amp;hellip;) you cease to think.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a meaning. Meaning is a formula, a set of sentences a mind can understand. Meaning is only found when you go beyond meaning. Life only makes sense when you perceive as mystery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you enjoying yourself? Bernard Shaw: it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Community is founded by free people, not by slaves emotionally dependant on other people. You enjoy yourself and reality and thus everybody.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How many people spend their lives eating the menu not food.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Lose your mind and come to your senses&amp;rdquo;. Take it with a pint of salt: you&amp;rsquo;ll need an intelligent mind to understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awareness = life.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-death-of-me">The death of me&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The only tragedy in the world is ignorance and all evil comes from there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Death is not a tragedy, death is wonderful. It&amp;rsquo;s only when you are afraid of life you are afraid of death.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The person who is fully alive is full of death. Dies to every moment just to be resurrected again.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The test of your awakening is the death of your belief in injustice and tragedy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changing the system will put a different set of wolfs in place, unless they are woken up. A system is about as good or as bad as the people who use it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t change the world, first change yourself. First take the plank out of your own eye. So when you move out to change others so you come from Love (Love can be hard).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="insight-and-understanding">Insight and understanding&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Insight, not effort, not cultivating habits, not having an ideal (ideals do a lot of damage)&lt;/strong> - it makes you focus on what should be instead of what is (present reality).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What happened? Was it always like this? Why did you want &amp;hellip;? Find the skeleton in your closet - the emotions that tie you to a situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="no-pushing-it">No pushing it&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not a question of imitating Christ, but becoming what he was.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pushing a broken car - you are making a mess of your life. &amp;ldquo;But we did it.&amp;rdquo; Insight, not pushing, not effort.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="getting-real">Getting real&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Father, what you said was absolutely true but totally useless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Observe yourself, pick-up those negative feelings, you&amp;rsquo;ll find your own way of explaining that and you&amp;rsquo;ll change. Then you&amp;rsquo;ll have to deal with a big villain - self-condemnation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="assorted-images">Assorted images&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Image of insight: boat with sails. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to push it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is nothing so cruel as the nature and there is no escape from it. Yet it is the heart that does the injury, the person&amp;rsquo;s own heart. When you cut water, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get hurt. When you cut solid stuff - it breaks. You&amp;rsquo;ve got solid attitudes inside-&amp;gt; pain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the eye is unobstructed, the result is sight. If the ear is unobstructed, the result is hearing&amp;hellip; If the mind is unobstructed, the result is wisdom. Wisdom is not experience, not applying yesterday&amp;rsquo;s solution to today&amp;rsquo;s problem. It comes from not being experienced, not carrying over residue from past experiences but rather being sensitive to this situation/person. If the heart is unobstructed, the result is love.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="saying-nothing-about-love">Saying nothing about love&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Plato: one cannot make a slave from a free person (i.e. a wise person). If someone forces you to walk one mile, go two. Need to change exterior situation? You need to be out of prison to be free? Freedom is in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prison - addictions, attachments, negative emotions, conditioning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can only love when you are alone. Love - to see as it really is, not as you imagine it to be (labels, projections from the past). Seeing needs a disciplined, alert mind. Take the trouble the see each situation, person in present moment&amp;rsquo;s freshness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="losing-control">Losing control&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Seeing means also dropping the control the society exercises over you. To remove it is like tearing yourself apart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pleasing addiction: as a child you were given taste for the drug called approval, attention, appreciation, success, prestige, power. Instead of solid nutritious food of life: work, play, fun, laughter, company of life, pleasures of senses and the mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A.S. Neil (Summerhill): a sign of a &lt;strong>sick child is always interested in persons. Healthy child is interested in things&lt;/strong> (it is sure of mother&amp;rsquo;s love).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awaken person: no longer marches to the drum of the society. It dances to the tune of the music that springs from within.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dependant on people, feeling terror when making mistakes etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sartre: hell is other people. If you are dependent, living with people is tension. Being without them, brings the agony of loneliness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="listening-to-life">Listening to life&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Enjoy things! Healthy food of life for mind and senses. Most of people have lost the capacity for enjoyment. They need more and more expensive gadgets. No time, guilty, overworked&amp;hellip; [back to simplicity].&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In natural state, animals don&amp;rsquo;t overeat, exercise as necessary etc. We have an inner conflict. &amp;ldquo;Take that plate of sweets away as in front of them I loose my freedom&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you enjoy immensely you need very little.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Slow down, taste, hear, smell &amp;hellip; + Awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-end-of-analysis">The end of analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Knowledge != awareness. Information: poisonous snake on my arm (leads to effort, rationalizations, alienation from oneself). Awareness: it would get brushed off through me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tasting and feeling the truth - awareness - you&amp;rsquo;ll change. When you just know it, you won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forced change, being rigid on yourself: &amp;ldquo;You want to be a martyr, marry a saint.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dead-ahead">Dead ahead&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The passport for living is to die, to imagine you are in your grave.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t live, you&amp;rsquo;re just keeping the body alive. When you are protecting your life (vegetable state) you&amp;rsquo;re dead. Only when you don&amp;rsquo;t care, you live. Life is for the gambler.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Information - cold facts. New feel, new perspective - Awareness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="cd-8">CD 8&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="the-land-of-love">The land of love&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you wish to love, you must learn to see again. If you wish to see, you must give the drug away - get rid of tentacles of society. Be in the world, but not of it - free and utterly alone in the heart.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>In solitude - in the desert - the dependence on your addiction will die. Aloneness means not depending emotionally on others&lt;/strong> - no longer seeing others as means of satisfying the addiction&amp;hellip; Asking to die.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Imagine a life where you refuse to enjoy a single word of approval and appreciation. Refuse to call anyone your &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo;. Having nowhere to rest your head.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>See with a vision that is clear - unclouded by fear or by desire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To come to the land of love you must pass through the gate of death. Get there by ceaseless awareness, by infinite compassion you&amp;rsquo;ll have for a drug addict. To develop a taste for good things of life - to counter your cravings. Love of work, which you enjoy doing, love of laugher, intimacy with people of whom you do not cling. Activities that you so much love to do, that success / approval / recognition won&amp;rsquo;t mean a thing to you. Return to nature, send the crowds away, go to the nature and silently commune with clouds, see, birds, plants&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Man with fire parable: He was not concerned about getting their recognition or their gratitude. He was concerned about their well-being&amp;hellip; Got killed by priests of the system and made into an idol, but there was no fire.&lt;/strong> We overemphasize &amp;ldquo;Lord Lord&amp;rdquo; but where is the fire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Love is generated through awareness. No other way. Love is not something you generate, you have. It has you. You surrender.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Analysis = paralysis. Insight! Aha experience -&amp;gt; change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Living means having dropped all impediments and live in the freshness of present moment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anything you are aware of keeps changing! Don&amp;rsquo;t identify with the feeling. As you do you&amp;rsquo;ll get insight why they came into place. No need to dwell in the past anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You are free to do whatever you as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t interfere with the freedom of others.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no violence in the kinds, because no one has practiced violence on them. Most of our evils arrive from violence to ourselves. A.S.Neil: Every child has god within. Our attempts to mold the child will turn the god into a devil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Progress. Are we more loving? Or have we created people of greater speed and precision?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A.S.Neil: &amp;ldquo;The religion that makes people good also makes people bad. But the religion known as freedom makes all people good for it destroys that self-conflict that makes people bad.&amp;rdquo; Wars come from self-conflict, we project what is inside to outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A.S.Neil: &amp;ldquo;The first thing I do when a child comes to Summerhill is to destroy its conscience.&amp;rdquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t need conscience when you have consciousness. Stop making demands on yourself, stop pushing yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nourish yourself on good wholesome food: sunsets, nature, good movie, good book, music, enjoyable work, good company and hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll break your addiction to those other feelings. Compare those feelings. Soul feelings vs. worldly feelings.&lt;/li>
