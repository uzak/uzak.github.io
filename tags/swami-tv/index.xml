Understanding is action only. Follow-by actions means effort only. You understand and act, that simple it is. That is how understanding operates. You know the movement of your mind. Mind is the object. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it a subject. If you make the mind subject: one part of the mind knows the other part of the mind. But then who knows that one part is known by the other? The witness, the true self.</description>

      <description>src1 4 ways of spirituality: karma, bhakti, yoga, jnana. Temple provides facility for all of these. People do all four. Nothing happens, because the mind is compulsive - hyperactive. Karma becomes mechanical, jnana becomes ideation, bhakti becomes a show - you&amp;rsquo;ll need outer symbols of love. Yoga - should be conscious, lose the eyes, be aware of every single movement the body is doing. How to feel brahman? You feel full and happy for no reason.</description>

      <description>As long as this &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; is with you, you&amp;rsquo;ll not understand what is meditation. It is not a process, not a technique, not a method. You&amp;rsquo;ve to drop the question &amp;ldquo;how to meditate?&amp;rdquo; and ask &amp;ldquo;what is meditation?&amp;rdquo;. Going to a dark room, isolating from the world around you, family, daily life. And you self-enclose yourself in a movement of the mind determined by the (dvaita) school of meditation you attend.</description>

When Gita was started, there was dharma, not religions. In the context of a dharmic civilization worship of Ishvara is called karma. 500 CE something like religious ID started. Before there Christ&amp;rsquo;s teaching were there. Action is different than work. All natures works. Only humans act. Action is work performed by a human being with a motive. Vivekananda. Humans are slaves. They don&amp;rsquo;t work like masters. They are slaves to the motives behind their acts.</description>

      <description>Class 1 The self is as it is not as it is imagined. The self remains veiled by the vasanas. And it reveals itself when there are no vasanas. That is called self-realization that leads to moksha. Desirelessness is godliness. A brashtah is one who doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay on the course. The loss is not total. Whatever ground you&amp;rsquo;ve gained, you&amp;rsquo;ll not lose it. All worldly accomplishments (wealth, power, knowledge) will be lost.</description>

Part 1, 2 Teaching from the Gita is more practical as that of Upanishad. Closer to the ordinary life. The body is the chariot. Arjuna is the master of the chariot. You&amp;rsquo;re Arjuna. Be clean. Be frank. Be like an open book. One who&amp;rsquo;s like that is Arjuna. No crookedness, no crafty-ness, innocence. The tree is called Arjuna because it soars straight into the sky. If you keep a distance between you and the teaching, you&amp;rsquo;ll be quoting Gita, not living Gita.</description>

      <description>Satsang 2022-09-02 the same vision, depth, as an Upanishad. If you have already studied Vedanta it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to have an open mind. What can I teach you? You already know. Listen without judging, with open mind, that&amp;rsquo;s meditation. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to take all this to the level of meditation. If you live a life of karma yoga you&amp;rsquo;re already a liberated soul. You see the snake instead of a garment because you&amp;rsquo;re insecure.</description>

      <description>Class 1 Upadesha is instruction. In jnanam there is only instruction, no handing over. Like there is in religion - handing over a mantra. The one instructing you can call instructor. You need not instruct nobody to go to a physician when he&amp;rsquo;s ill. But when the psyche is ill, nobody will even acknowledge that he&amp;rsquo;s sick. And when somebody points out that you&amp;rsquo;re sick in the mind, you become angry.</description>

      <description>Satsang 2021-08-03 The right way to listen to a speaker is to set aside your knowledge. Knowledge - accumulation. You neither agree nor disagree with the speaker. The idea is to think about it and that is how we learn Most of meditations can be classified as fancy or imaginations. Sometimes this fancy or imaginations acquires a status of tradition. Law of repetition: whenever there is repetition it is bound to become a cult.</description>

      <description>Class 1 Small prakarana by Shankaracarya pravaha - flow, activity, current. When it comes to knowledge, there no division between east and west. Nature of work is grow, until it occupies all free time you have. It is the means that shapes the end. You won&amp;rsquo;t get the end independent of the means If bhakti is separates from philosophy, it becomes superstitious. Religion loses its transforming power. Society comes into focus, not individual liberation.</description>

      <description>Class 1 Message of hindu dharma to the entire humanity can be summarised by this single verse. IshAvAsyaM idaM sarvaM - all this is pervaded by God. anta - essence, end. Vedanta - essence of Veda. Essence comes at the end, just like dessert. pramA - correct knowledge, correct understanding. Vedanta - means of knowledge. Veda is a body of knowledge, collections of words that help us to know. Thus it is a means of knowledge.</description>

Class 1 Yoga: communion with God means god consciousness. Because it is like communion with space. It means you feel the presence of Ishwara at all times, everywhere. kamukha = lover, horny All manifestation is in the form of opposites. You cannot have a world without contradiction. You cannot have any manifestation without the dharma adharma opposites. If a person is pursuing sukha trying to avoid dukha, he is not trying to transcend.</description>

Mind is a movement. It has to flow either towards samsara or towards Ishvara. There is no 3rd flow. As it contemplates upon Ishvara there is a reasonless joy. Mind becomes what it things upon. When mind contemplates upon Shiva that is enough to bring out inherent joy as wave after wave. Bhakti is an emotion. It is not knowledge, it is emotion. It prepares the mind for higher knowledge by purifying.</description>

deva - shining. The one light that is always shining: consciousness. Happiness flowing from (coffee) cup into heart -&amp;gt; revert. By conditioning gold as neckless you have not made its value lesser. Gold is the origin of necklace and gold abides in the necklace. Existence has an opposite - non existence. Being has none. Being is the foundation of the entire universe. Being is atma, the essence of entire universe of forms.</description>

      <description>Summary
SA/EN anuvAka 1 - 11
Class 1 (2021-01-16) Primary aspect of Rg Veda is upasana. Mental worship. In Yajur Veda focus is karma. Veda is divided into samhita (collection of mantras, hymns) and brahmana, which is dos and donts, rituals. Brahmana is subdivided into 1) brahmana 2) aranjaka 3) last portion is upanishad. We&amp;rsquo;re all devotes of supreme will. Rshih - the one who sees the truth. In Vedic times the vedic seers worshiped the same supreme will in the form of natural forces.</description>

1: imagination vs. acceptance, mechanical vs. wonder(full) Your attachment to the name and form acts like a shield to cover up the reality. Even while seeing the name and form you see through the name and form and then you&amp;rsquo;re in communion with reality. You&amp;rsquo;re awareness of the waking state. Not the world and person that shines through it. Samsara is put in place by identification with the gunas because of ignorance.</description>

1 &amp;amp; 2: Seeing. Exploration vs. Accumulation Outward simplicity with inward fragmentary thinking (caste, creed, lingam&amp;hellip;) -&amp;gt; obstacle to the truth. If mind is the origin, it isn&amp;rsquo;t truth, only concept/idea. Products of the hand (objects) and of the mind (ideas) have taken over our reality. Give up all of those. (3) Always open, always learning, no conclusion. Conclusion means the truth is truncated, no longer infinite.</description>

Goal: knowledge. Quality: simplicity. Have self-confidence. Be punctual, it shows you are earnest about it. Life is relationships. Try to enrich every relationship with love. Don&amp;rsquo;t put reciprocity, expectations in place. Seek love which is God. Seek freedom (psychological freedom from expectations, from seeking advantage) so you can discover that love. Love is unity in diversity. If diversity is real, there is no love. In non-duality the truth is one but appears as many.</description>

Class 1 considered highest text of Vedanta. Something like Mandukya. Generally not taught to beginners. requires an open mind. When you have an open mind, you will not be there. Only the faculty of cognition will be there. If you are a person, then you are not open.

      <description>Upadesha Sahasri (2019) Talks by Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswati
Class 1, 2 Life - infinite, vast, mystery, not just an occupation. Family people, society believes life means securing livelihood. Thinking like this we miss the whole point of life. The same life in you is in a bird, sun, stars, rivers, everywhere. Hiranyagarbha. Job, marry, children and become more and more like a machine. Example: wet grinder. Remain fearful, anxious, afraid of life and death.</description>

      <description>Ashtavakra Gita - Swami Tattvavidananda
Class 1 Yoga, gym&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t neglect the body. Practical Vedanta with impact on life, not academical. Not sub-serving a system, method, formula. You can&amp;rsquo;t have both. No prioritization, just one goal. Intellect - tool for knowing - pair of tongs. Self-enquiry instead of self-knowledge. Tongs cannot catch themselves. You can only be yourself. Who are you? You are not looking for the answer but staying with the question.</description>
