going down to the water.
The lame and dreamy goat
brings up the rear.
There are worried faces about that one,
but now they&amp;rsquo;re laughing,
because look, as they return,
that goat is leading!
There are many different kinds of knowing.
The lame goat&amp;rsquo;s kind is a branch
that traces back to the roots of presence.
Learn from the lame goat,
and lead the herd home.</description></item></channel></rss>
