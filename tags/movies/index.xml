      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be alive like this tree around which we&amp;rsquo;ve built this world. Is there a way to avoid this war? Troy will not fall so gently. Turn Troy to dust. Return with the spoils of enemies you&amp;rsquo;ve slain and my heart will rejoice. The gods of sea and sky carried me towards Troy. The walls of Troy reach to the clouds. I did not want you to escape this journey.</description>

      <description>The year is 2045 and the reality sucks so much that practically all humanity spends most of its time in a virtual reality called OASIS. Recently its Author has passed away and he&amp;rsquo;s offered his position including the ownership of OASIS to anybody who masters his three challenges:
 Win an unwinnable race. The key to this challenge is to drive backwards. Ask the Lady of the Author to dance. Easy, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>Initial song name from OST: Dead already
  I&amp;rsquo;ve lost something. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what it is but I know didn&amp;rsquo;t always feel this sedated. But you know what? It&amp;rsquo;s never too late to get it back.
  It&amp;rsquo;s the weirdest thing. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a coma for about 20 years and I&amp;rsquo;m just now waking up.
  &amp;hellip; retiring to the men&amp;rsquo;s room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a life that doesn&amp;rsquo;t so closely remember hell.</description>

      <description>Losing all hope is freedom. Illusion of safety. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. It&amp;rsquo;s only after we&amp;rsquo;ve lost everything that we&amp;rsquo;re free to do anything. Advertising has chasing us cars and clothes. Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don&amp;rsquo;t need. Our Great War is a spiritual war, our Great Depression is our lives. Stop trying to control everything and just let go. Condom is the glass slipper of our generation.</description>

      <description>A king might move a man, a father may claim a son, but that man can also move himself, and only then does that man truly begin his own game. Remember that howsoever you are played or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone, even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power. When you stand before God, you cannot say, &amp;ldquo;But I was told by others to do thus,&amp;rdquo; or that virtue was not convenient at the time.</description>

      <description>I went for it all. Wife, house, children. The full catastrophe.
  Life is trouble. To be alive is to undo your belt and look for trouble.
  Good or bad, what is the difference? They all end up the same way.
  A man needs a little madness or else he never dares to cut the rope and be free.
  “This is true happiness: to have no ambition and to work like a horse as if you had every ambition.</description>
