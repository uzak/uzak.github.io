It can perform calculations, store and retrieve information and controlls devices.\nComponents # Input devices # Keyboard Mouse Microphone Scanner Touch display Serve to enter data and instructions. Analogy: like your senses - they gather information for the computer from the outside worlds.\nOutput devices # Present results of computer\u0026rsquo;s processing to the user.\nMonitor Printers Speakers Analogy: your actions. You communicate with (towards) the world by them.\nVon Neumann Architecture # Proposed by Jon von Neumann in 1945.\nHow does a CPU work? # Operating Systems # Programming # Hands-on Exercise # Install htop.
