        <p>Initial song name from OST: <em>Dead already</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve lost something. I’m not exactly sure what it is but I know didn’t always feel this sedated. But you know what? It’s never too late to get it back.</li>
  <li>It’s the weirdest thing. I feel like I’ve been in a coma for about 20 years and I’m just now waking up.</li>
  <li>… retiring to the men’s room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a life that doesn’t so closely remember hell.</li>
  <li>Don’t underestimate the power of denial.</li>
  <li>I’m just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.</li>
  <li>I’ve got that [frozen] homeless woman on videotape. Why would you film that? Because it was amazing. What’s amazing about it? When you see something like that, it’s like God is looking right at you just for a second. And if you are careful, you can look right back. And what do you see? Beauty.</li>
  <li>That’s the day where I realised that there was this entire life behind things. And this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know that there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.</li>
  <li>Video’s a poor excuse. I know. But it helps me remember. I need to remember. Sometimes there is so much … beauty … in the world. I feel like I can’t take it. My heart is just going to cave in.</li>
  <li>This isn’t life. This is stuff. And it has become more important to you than living.</li>
  <li>Today is the first day of the rest of your life.</li>
  <li>No, no. You don’t get to tell me what to do ever again.</li>
  <li>Me-centered living.</li>
  <li>I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me but it’s so hard to stay mad when there is so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once and it is too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that’s about to burst. And then I remember to relax and stop trying to hold on to it. And then it flows through me like rain, and I can’t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life. You have no idea what I’m talking about, I’m sure. But don’t worry. You will someday.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The Beatles - Because:</p>

    <p>Because the world is round it turns me on<br />
  Because the world is round, ah</p>

    <p>Because the wind is high it blows my mind<br />
  Because the wind is high, ah</p>

    <p>Love is old, love is new<br />
  Love is all, love is you</p>

    <p>Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry<br />
  Because the sky is blue, ah</p>

    <p>Ah, ah, ah,ah</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimate song name from OST: <em>Still dead</em></p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>still - without movement, without noise (de), calm</li>
  <li>still - eternal, always, persistent</li>
</ul>

<p>still = truth = infinity = being</p>
