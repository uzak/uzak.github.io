# Saradastotram
* Krishna: sradhavan labhate jnanam. Asradhavan labhate hypothesis.
* First sradha, then medha, then dharana (retaining power). All are different manifestations of Saraswati only.
* bhadrakali - auspicious destroyer (of ignorance).
* In vedanta intelligence should go with character. If any is missing, vedanta won't work.
* Peace goes with character.
* Because knowledge can be converted into language we need not to make the discoveries again and again.
* Bumanness is destroyed if Saraswati is not there. Humans will be as good as animals.
* IT means saraswati devi.
