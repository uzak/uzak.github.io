Nature of Caitanyam
===================

```
aprameyah      - cannot be experienced. it is ever the experiencer, subject.
                 like camera. no proof for existence needed, never in the
                 picture
nityah         - eternal. like light, when hand is removed.
nirvikarah     - not subject to any change. constant. even when hand is 
                 moving, light doesn't change.
sarvagatah     - all pervading. no (spatial) boundaries. like light. 
akarta, abokta - doesn't perform any action. therefore no punyam no papam.
                 hand can do action and become dirty. light never does.
satyah         - independent existence (independent upon matter). everything
                 depends on atma for existence. atha = truth. real.
```
