                            <p>Everyone thinks of themselves as capable and outstanding while I appeared unlearned.<br>
A virtuous person never forces his way and hence will not make faults.</p>
<p>Thus, a kind person is the teacher of the unkind.<br>
An unkind person is a lesson for the kind to learn.</p>
<p>It is the empty space in the room that gives its function.<br>
Therefore, something substantial can be beneficial.<br>
While the emptiness of void is what can be utilized.</p>
<p>The wise does not speak.</p>
<p>Many words lead to exhaustion.<br>
It is better to center on the true essence within.</p>
<p>Water benefits all things and contends not with them.<br>
It puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be and thus is closest to Tao.<br>
A virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to the perfect place.</p>
<p>Wealth and treasures are but illusions that one cannot possess.</p>
<p>Thus, honor is based on humbleness.</p>
<p>In pursuing Tao, one is enlightened with the true nature and thus diminishes daily one’s worldly desires and knowledge.<br>
The continuous depletion of one’s desires persists until one acts accordingly to the natural Way.<br>
By acting without personal intention enables one to accomplish all things.</p>
<p>The saint trusts those who are trustworthy.<br>
He also trusts those who are not trustworthy.</p>
<p>Hence, a saint does not strive to do something great.</p>
<p>I have Three Treasures that I hold and guard.<br>
The first is Kindness.<br>
The second is Simplicity.<br>
The third is Humbleness.<br>
With Kindness, one can be courageous.<br>
With Simplicity, one can be generous.<br>
With Humbleness, one can be the lead to provide guidance.</p>
<p>A faithful Tao cultivator does not use force.<br>
A good warrior does not lose his temper.<br>
A great conqueror does not challenge others.<br>
A good leader is humble.</p>
<p>One who pretends to know what he is ignorant of, is at fault.</p>
<p>Thus a saint acts without holding on to the achievements.<br>
He accomplishes but does not claim for credit.<br>
He has no desire to distinguish himself.</p>
<p>The Tao of Nature,<br>
Does not contend, yet easily wins.<br>
Does not speak, yet always responds.<br>
Does not summon, yet all things gather.<br>
Does not contemplate as if at ease,<br>
Yet all plans were devised perfectly.<br>
The Law of Nature is like a giant web,<br>
Although sparsely meshed, nothing can slip through.</p>
<p>People would then enjoy the simple food, simple clothing, and be contented with a simple life.</p>
<p>The wise one does not argue.<br>
He who argues is not wise.</p>
<p>The Way of a saint is to act naturally without contention.</p>

The more he helps others, the richer his life becomes.<br>
The more he gives to others, the more he gets in return.</h2>
<p>Therefore, a saint cultivates himself with introspection and self-discipline without blaming others for faults.<br>
Hence, a person of virtue acts as if he were the debtor.</p>
<p>The Tao of Nature is impersonal which makes no exception to anyone.<br>
It always assists those that are kind and virtuous.</p>
<p>When a plant is alive, it is soft and flexible.<br>
When it is dead, it becomes dry and brittle.<br>
Therefore, hard and rigid shall lead to death.<br>
Soft and gentle shall lead to life.<br>
Thus, a strong army with rigid force shall not win.<br>
A thick and big tree will be cut down for its use.<br>
The big and strong will take an inferior position.<br>
The soft and gentle will take superior position.</p>
<p>He who makes promises easily seldom keeps his words.<br>
He who constantly regards things as easy shall result in difficulty.</p>
<p>The saint realizes his true nature and hence does not distinguish himself.</p>
<p>He who acts with desire shall fail.<br>
He who tries to possess shall lose.</p>
<p>Most people fail when they are near completion.</p>
<p>The ancient Tao cultivators,<br>
Did not lead people to acquire knowledge to be tricky,<br>
But to guide them to restore their simplicity and innocence.<br>
The reason people are difficult to be governed is because they are clever and witty.</p>
<p>Harmonize with the glory.<br>
Mix with the lowliness.<br>
Because the wise is unified with all and has no distinction,</p>
<p>I have no personal desires,<br>
Manage without intentional concern.<br>
Taste without desire of the flavor.<br>
Hold the same regard for big or small, abundant or little and reward the unkind with kindness.<br>
Plan for the difficult while it is easy.</p>
<p>Simplicity is to restrain one’s desires.</p>
<p>A great nation rules by placing itself in a lowly position like the rivers that flow into the low regions of ocean.</p>
<p>Tao gives birth to all things.<br>
And Te (virtue) nurtures them.<br>
Matter shapes them.<br>
The natural environment matures them.<br>
Therefore, all things abide by Tao and honor Te.<br>
Hence, Tao gives life to all beings and Te nurtures, grows, fosters, develops, matures, supports, and protects them.</p>
<p>Great tone has no sound.<br>
Great Tao is formless,<br>
It is invisible and has no name.<br>
It benefits all and fulfills all.</p>
<p>The greatest crime is to have too much desire.<br>
The greatest disaster is not to find contentment.<br>
The greatest mistake is to desire for endless possession.<br>
Hence, when one is gratified with self-contentment,<br>
True contentment can then long endure.</p>
<p>Because a saint does not restrict himself with the greatness,<br>
Hence his greatness is accomplished.</p>
<p>Gentleness overcomes strength, and the meek overcomes the strong.</p>
<p>A person of knowledge and self-opinion will be hindered from the enlightenment of Tao.</p>
<p>To know the strong masculine principle, yet abide by the gentle female principle is like being the valley of the world where all rivers will flow into.</p>
<p>Therefore, one who follows the true nature will understand the principle of cause and effect and shall not rely upon the strength of force.<br>
By knowing the effect, although one has no choice, one still abides with the principle of cause and effect and does not resolve into force</p>
<p>When Tao is manifested, names were given for the purpose of distinction.</p>
<p>Transcend the saint’s teaching and conceal one’s wisdom for potential use, shall benefit the people a hundred fold.</p>
<p>I am calm and peaceful like the boundless ocean.</p>
<p>To be in need is to possess.<br>
To be hollow is to be filled.</p>
<p>Although he is surrounded by the splendor of wealth, he remains to live a simple and ordinary life.</p>
<p>Therefore, he who values the world as much as he values himself, can be entrusted with the ruling of the world.<br>
He who loves the world as much as he loves himself, can be entrusted with the guidance of the world.</p>
<p>Those who are not content with fame is like polishing the edge of a knife.<br>
The sharper it gets, the easier it is to break.<br>
The nature Tao teaches one to retreat after one’s success and not to hold on to the credit.</p>
<p>A person of great virtue is like the flowing water.</p>
<p>Although he is not self-concerned, finds himself accomplished.<br>
It is because he is not focused on self-interests and hence can fulfill his true nature.</p>
<p>By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall into dispute.<br>
By not valuing the hard to get objects, people will not become robbers.<br>
By not seeing the desires of lust, one’s heart will not be confused.</p>
