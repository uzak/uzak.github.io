                            <h1>Mundaka</h1>
<ul>
<li>mundaka = head,</li>
<li>spider and net,</li>
<li>arrow, bow, target,</li>
<li>river and ocean,</li>
<li>two birds on a tree,</li>
<li>fire and spark.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Kena</h1>
<ul>
<li>eye of the eye, voice of the voice...</li>
<li>Cannot be known. Cannot be not known. Is the ID. When it is known it can only be the reflection. Just like an eye cannot ever see itself.</li>
<li>Indra needed Uma Devi. We need also a guru for self-knowledge. It cannot be gained without.</li>
<li>Lord like lighting, blinking, thought. And possessor of all glories.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Katha</h1>
<ul>
<li>Naciketas and Yamadharmaraja,</li>
<li>chariot analogy,</li>
<li>body and consciousness. Two independent inseparable entities. Like light and hand.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Kaivalya</h1>
<ul>
<li>not commented by Shankaracharya,</li>
<li>topic is moksa (kaivalyam) = no need to change the setup,</li>
<li>on meditation,</li>
<li>teacher Brahman, student rshi Ashvalayana,</li>
<li>world is only a mithya product/property of brahman. It has no effect on him -&gt; on me.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Taittiriya</h1>
<ul>
<li>2nd bimba vs. pratibimba ananda. atmananda Vs koshananda; </li>
<li>7 proofs for the existence of brahman: <ol>
<li>every product presupposes intelligent cause (creator). nimita karanatvat</li>
<li>material cause. upadana karanatvat</li>
<li>brahman alone is existing in the form of you the experiencer now. jiva rupena vartamanatvat.</li>
<li>ananda hetutvat: hapiness can come only out of infinite. and we are experiencing hapiness... every moment of joy comes out of brahma</li>
<li>inert body is functioning -&gt; because of some cetana tatvam (=brahman) vyapara hetutvat</li>
<li>security of sanyasis. the source of their security (they have nothing). abhaya hetutvat.</li>
<li>bhaya hetutvat. source of fear if it is not understood properly. not understood brahman becomes source of fear. rope -&gt; snake.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>both jnani and ajnani are brahman. jnani has only removed notion of being apart from brahman.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Mandukya</h1>
<ul>
<li>Smallest out of the ten Upanishads; 12 mantras; summary of other Upanishads.</li>
<li>Analysis by Gaudapada.</li>
<li>"frog" upanishad.</li>
<li>4 prakaranam</li>
<li>atma vichara - my relationship with the world. Existence of an object depends on its knowability. Any object is only knowable when there is a knower. Therefore is depending on the knower and therefore is mithya. A knower comes to existence only when I choose to know. Therefore knower also has a dependent existence also is mithya. Both knower and knowable depend on I the consciousness. They are Nama Rupa. The entire Nama Rupa which is resting on me is divided into three categories.</li>
<li>Chatuspath Atma:<ol>
<li>Vishva (knower) - virat (known).</li>
<li>Taijasa - Hiranyagarbha.</li>
<li>Prajna - Ishwara</li>
<li>without reference to any nama-rupa I am called Thurya.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Omkara vichara. 4 parts. AUM plus silence. In silence there is the witness/illuminator of the silence, not nothing.</li>
<li>Karya pada. Tree. Sthula and sukshma</li>
<li>Karana pada. Seed.</li>
<li>Karya karana vilakshana. Beyond both.</li>
<li>Conscious being doesn't need a knower to reveal its existence, unlike inert objects.</li>
<li>
<p>Creation = I plus Nama Rupa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Borrowed attribute. Not my own. Existence for objects is borrowed, like warmth of water. Dream example. Experience does not prove reality, like sunrise, blue sky or flat earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation is unreal and cannot ever come from Brahman. He is beyond time and space thus it cannot be subject to modification. Any modification is caused by time. A cause produces effect by modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gatakasha example: pot space. All attributes (movement, separation, death and birth) belong to the container and wrongly are attributed to the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adhyaropa apavada method. Introduce world, reveal Brahman, dismiss shrsti. Example: 17 elephants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>World is in me. World does depend on me. World does not affect me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the standpoint of consciousness the mind is unreal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buddhism - only flow of thoughts exists. Who is present to witness the flow?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strong raga dvesha - attributing too much reality. Losing the peace of mind, forgetting Vedanta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mistaken Brahman is creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asparsha yoga</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alatam drshtanta - patterns of a glowing stick appear in the night example. No substance other than the stick.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Isavasya</h1>
<ul>
<li>Packed: 18 verses. Commented upon in Brhadaranyaka.</li>
<li>Though: Words do not have literal meaning.</li>
<li>ishwara arpana prasada Bhavana plus satvik actions - karma yoga. Isavasya also recommends upasana.</li>
<li>The more beneficiaries the better.</li>
<li>The wise person see the world as atma.</li>
<li>isavasya idagm sarvam. See the secure atma everywhere.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Aitareya</h1>
<ul>
<li>the only Upanishad from Rig veda</li>
<li>travel of Jiva: bijam in father, then in mother's body, then it's own body, then repeat. If you are tired better known the one beyond this cycle.</li>
<li>prajnanam brahman - the real I</li>
<li>take ant knowledge, remove the thought. What remains is I the pure consciousness</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prashna</h1>
<ul>
<li>Commentary upon Mundaka Upanishad.</li>
<li>Dialogue between a rishi and six disciples - six chapters.</li>
<li>Belongs to Atharvana veda.</li>
<li>First four chapters atma anatma viveka. Creation is of complementary pairs, not opposites. prana shrestatvam. All life is and depends on prana. Prana depends on Atma/Bhagavan. Prana is like a shadow of atma.</li>
<li>5.: omkara upasana as a mean for krama multi.</li>
<li>6.: brahman in the form of shodasha atma purushaha. Creation as the body of the lord.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Brhadaranyaka</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upanishad of the great forests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are all Brahmajis children born out of fear and loneliness.</p>
</li>
<li>Jivatma = new name for Paramatma (within the physical body).</li>
<li>Every dream individual can claim I am the waker. Every Jiva can claim I am Brahman the creator. I became afraid of my own creation.</li>
<li>Not missing anything is ananda. Brahman alone is purnaha. Ananda swarupa. Everybody loves oneself only.</li>
<li>avidyam -&gt; kama -&gt; karma</li>
<li>
<p>World is the object of experience. 7 annam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleeping person example. Consciousness being intrinsic. Other states incidental.</p>
</li>
<li>Upanishad - secret name - satyasya satyam.</li>
<li>neti neti - negate everything relative. Whatever is left behind is paramathika satyam. Sakshi chaitanyam.</li>
<li>Self-love universal.</li>
<li>Since atma is universally loved - atma must be source of ananda</li>
<li>Since atma is source of ananda it must be worth knowing</li>
<li>Atma - Chaitanya svarupa</li>
<li>Atma is source of everything</li>
<li>Atma alone is appearing in the form of everything</li>
<li>Atma is nirvikalpa. I the indivisible self am appearing as the world. Division is only apparent.</li>
<li>
<p>Atma is never an object of your experience. It is the experiencer of everything. Whatever I see can be only image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Madhu Vidya: atharvana rishi Ashwini kumaras samvada:</p>
</li>
<li>whole world is interdependent. You the atma observer are the substratum</li>
<li>atma the indveller in the body. Puru - body. sha - indveller</li>
<li>atma - allpervading brahman. Like potspace is allpervading space </li>
<li>atma is beyond karya karana, time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Chapter</h2>
<ul>
<li>heat generation - argument between scholars. yagnavalkya - 8scholars - gargi - 1000 cows</li>
<li>innermost essence - self evident consciousness. It is ever free.</li>
<li>Sanyasa - mental preparedness to lose anything at any time.</li>
<li>Antaryami (saguna, distorted) - akshara chaitanyam (not distorted) described by neti-neti.</li>
<li>What is beyond matter you can never understand intellectually. Field of consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Chapter</h2>
<ul>
<li>light generation - teaching. Yagnavalkya and Yanaka.</li>
<li>chatuspath atma - consciousness seen as endowed with four aspects. Facets: vishwa - virat, taijasa - hiranyagarbha, prajna - iswara, turiya (pure consciousness).</li>
<li>There is no time and space where consciousness is pure. Any state of experience is state in which conciousness is associated with gross/subtle/causal world.</li>
<li>Pure consciousness can be arrived only through wisdom, understanding. By nisheda vakyam: neti-neti.
    1) what is existent can never be negated. Law of conservation of matter and energy.
    2) what is non-existent need not be negated. Yet Veda negates the world. World cannot come under 1) and not 2) as we experience it. -&gt; world is 
    3) sat-asat-vilakshanam. Existentially existent, factually as good as non existent - mithya. If world is mithya relationship (of the consciousness) with the world is also mithya. I am seemingly related to the world all the time. I am really not related to the world at any time. Since not really related I am always turiyam.</li>
<li>Sense organs, mind, consciousness compared to light principle = that in which presence forms and colours are known.</li>
<li>In the absence of consciousness everything becomes inert. Nothing can be known.</li>
<li>Who makes conciousness evident? Self luminous consciousness I am, unrelated to what is experienced.</li>
<li>Samsara - assuming the problems of the world to be my own problems. Nearest example - dream.</li>
<li>Even before death coming janma is indicated by the dreams we get.</li>
<li>Moksha example: snake removing the skin.</li>
<li>Moksha example: sushupti. Purnatvam and ananda enjoyed in sleep by dropping superimposed limitations.</li>
<li>Moksha - freedom from guilt and regret.</li>
<li>
<p>Without knowledge (that I am will be and always was free) a life is wasted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 compulsory disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li>karma joga: before jnanam after the same is called paropa karmani for loka sangrahaha. like tax for living</li>
<li>upasana: meditation before jnanam. after nididhiasanam (paramathika and vyavaharika amshas of ishwara)</li>
<li>saatgunyam: acquisition and maintenance of daivi sampat. before jnanam called sadhana after alankara (decoration)</li>
<li>Vedanta vichara: pre jnanam - study. post jnanam - nishta (revision).</li>
<li>3 supportive (sahakari) sadhanas and study (mukhya sadhana). all are important all the time. don't give up any.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>devas asuras and manushya being taught from prajapati (da-da-da teaching, like thunder). problem of devas - extrovertedness, kama. help: sense control - damah. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>asuras: inconsideration for others. tendency to be rough. krodha. help: empathy - daya.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>omkara upasana. chitanasharupena (puranamkam) - consciousness compared to bhutakasharupena (vayuramkam) - space. because so many similar features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hiranyagarbha upasanas. mind/intellect. prana  reverence to life in any form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>virat upasana. jataragni. digestive fire. can be heard with closed eyes...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3x anatma upasana.</p>
</li>

<li>looking at death as vanaprasta or sanyasa ashrama.</li>
<li>
<p>cremation offering to Agni.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Panchaagni vidya - travel of jiva in his potential shariram given by atni between death and another janma: svarga - rain - earth - father (by food) - woman</p>
</li>
<li>krshnagatih - price for good karmas. associated with devatas of darkness. svarga. named because spiritual ignorance due to extrovertion is more there.</li>
<li>sukla gathi. krama mukti. good karmas along with ishwara dhyanam. destination Brahma loka. associated with devatas of light</li>
