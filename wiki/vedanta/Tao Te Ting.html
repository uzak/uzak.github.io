                            <p>Everyone thinks of themselves as capable and outstanding while I appeared unlearned. <br />
A virtuous person never forces his way and hence will not make faults.   </p>
<p>Thus, a kind person is the teacher of the unkind.<br />
An unkind person is a lesson for the kind to learn.  </p>
<p>It is the empty space in the room that gives its function.<br />
Therefore, something substantial can be beneficial.<br />
While the emptiness of void is what can be utilized.   </p>
<p>The wise does not speak.   </p>
<p>Many words lead to exhaustion.<br />
It is better to center on the true essence within.   </p>
<p>Water benefits all things and contends not with them.<br />
It puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be and thus is closest to Tao.<br />
A virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to the perfect place.   </p>
<p>Wealth and treasures are but illusions that one cannot possess.  </p>
<p>Thus, honor is based on humbleness.   </p>
<p>In pursuing Tao, one is enlightened with the true nature and thus diminishes daily one’s worldly desires and knowledge.<br />
The continuous depletion of one’s desires persists until one acts accordingly to the natural Way.<br />
By acting without personal intention enables one to accomplish all things.  </p>
<p>The saint trusts those who are trustworthy.<br />
He also trusts those who are not trustworthy.   </p>
<p>Hence, a saint does not strive to do something great.   </p>
<p>I have Three Treasures that I hold and guard.<br />
The first is Kindness.<br />
The second is Simplicity.<br />
The third is Humbleness. <br />
With Kindness, one can be courageous.<br />
With Simplicity, one can be generous.<br />
With Humbleness, one can be the lead to provide guidance.   </p>
<p>A faithful Tao cultivator does not use force.<br />
A good warrior does not lose his temper.<br />
A great conqueror does not challenge others.<br />
A good leader is humble.  </p>
<p>One who pretends to know what he is ignorant of, is at fault.   </p>
<p>Thus a saint acts without holding on to the achievements.<br />
He accomplishes but does not claim for credit.<br />
He has no desire to distinguish himself.   </p>
<p>The Tao of Nature,<br />
Does not contend, yet easily wins.<br />
Does not speak, yet always responds.<br />
Does not summon, yet all things gather.<br />
Does not contemplate as if at ease,<br />
Yet all plans were devised perfectly. <br />
The Law of Nature is like a giant web,<br />
Although sparsely meshed, nothing can slip through.  </p>
<p>People would then enjoy the simple food, simple clothing, and be contented with a simple life.   </p>
<p>The wise one does not argue.<br />
He who argues is not wise.   </p>
<p>The Way of a saint is to act naturally without contention.   </p>
<p>A saint does not possess and accumulate surplus for personal desire.<br />
The more he helps others, the richer his life becomes.<br />
The more he gives to others, the more he gets in return. <br />
--<br />
Therefore, a saint cultivates himself with introspection and self-discipline without blaming others for faults. <br />
Hence, a person of virtue acts as if he were the debtor.   </p>
<p>The Tao of Nature is impersonal which makes no exception to anyone.<br />
It always assists those that are kind and virtuous.  </p>
<p>When a plant is alive, it is soft and flexible.<br />
When it is dead, it becomes dry and brittle.<br />
Therefore, hard and rigid shall lead to death.<br />
Soft and gentle shall lead to life. <br />
Thus, a strong army with rigid force shall not win.<br />
A thick and big tree will be cut down for its use.<br />
The big and strong will take an inferior position.<br />
The soft and gentle will take superior position.   </p>
<p>He who makes promises easily seldom keeps his words.<br />
He who constantly regards things as easy shall result in difficulty.   </p>
<p>The saint realizes his true nature and hence does not distinguish himself.   </p>
<p>He who acts with desire shall fail.<br />
He who tries to possess shall lose.   </p>
<p>Most people fail when they are near completion.   </p>
<p>The ancient Tao cultivators,<br />
Did not lead people to acquire knowledge to be tricky,<br />
But to guide them to restore their simplicity and innocence.<br />
The reason people are difficult to be governed is because they are clever and witty.   </p>
<p>Harmonize with the glory.<br />
Mix with the lowliness. <br />
Because the wise is unified with all and has no distinction,   </p>
<p>I have no personal desires, <br />
Manage without intentional concern.<br />
Taste without desire of the flavor. <br />
Hold the same regard for big or small, abundant or little and reward the unkind with kindness.<br />
Plan for the difficult while it is easy.   </p>
<p>Simplicity is to restrain one’s desires.   </p>
<p>A great nation rules by placing itself in a lowly position like the rivers that flow into the low regions of ocean.   </p>
<p>Tao gives birth to all things.<br />
And Te (virtue) nurtures them.<br />
Matter shapes them.<br />
The natural environment matures them. <br />
Therefore, all things abide by Tao and honor Te. <br />
Hence, Tao gives life to all beings and Te nurtures, grows, fosters, develops, matures, supports, and protects them.   </p>
<p>Great tone has no sound.<br />
Great Tao is formless,<br />
It is invisible and has no name.<br />
It benefits all and fulfills all.   </p>
<p>The greatest crime is to have too much desire.<br />
The greatest disaster is not to find contentment.<br />
The greatest mistake is to desire for endless possession.<br />
Hence, when one is gratified with self-contentment,<br />
True contentment can then long endure.   </p>
<p>Because a saint does not restrict himself with the greatness,<br />
Hence his greatness is accomplished.   </p>
<p>Gentleness overcomes strength, and the meek overcomes the strong.  </p>
<p>A person of knowledge and self-opinion will be hindered from the enlightenment of Tao.   </p>
<p>To know the strong masculine principle, yet abide by the gentle female principle is like being the valley of the world where all rivers will flow into.  </p>
<p>Therefore, one who follows the true nature will understand the principle of cause and effect and shall not rely upon the strength of force. <br />
By knowing the effect, although one has no choice, one still abides with the principle of cause and effect and does not resolve into force  </p>
<p>When Tao is manifested, names were given for the purpose of distinction.   </p>
<p>Transcend the saint’s teaching and conceal one’s wisdom for potential use, shall benefit the people a hundred fold.  </p>
<p>I am calm and peaceful like the boundless ocean.   </p>
<p>To be in need is to possess. <br />
To be hollow is to be filled.   </p>
<p>Although he is surrounded by the splendor of wealth, he remains to live a simple and ordinary life.   </p>
<p>Therefore, he who values the world as much as he values himself, can be entrusted with the ruling of the world.<br />
He who loves the world as much as he loves himself, can be entrusted with the guidance of the world.   </p>
<p>Those who are not content with fame is like polishing the edge of a knife.<br />
The sharper it gets, the easier it is to break.<br />
The nature Tao teaches one to retreat after one’s success and not to hold on to the credit.   </p>
<p>A person of great virtue is like the flowing water.  </p>
<p>Although he is not self-concerned, finds himself accomplished. <br />
It is because he is not focused on self-interests and hence can fulfill his true nature.   </p>
<p>By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall into dispute.<br />
By not valuing the hard to get objects, people will not become robbers.<br />
By not seeing the desires of lust, one’s heart will not be confused.   </p>
