# Jnana yoga

1. I'm of the nature of eternal and all pervasive consciousness.
2. I'm the only source of permanent peace, security and happiness.
3. Only by mere presence I give life to the material body and through it experience the material universe.
4. I'm not affected by anything that takes place in the material world and in the material body including the material mind
5. By forgetting my nature I convert life into a struggle and by remembering it I convert it into a sport or entertainment.

Bhakti yoga = karma yoga + jnana yoga

# Format conversion

From: Triangular: Jiva-Jagat-Iswara (moksha is future event).   
To: Binary: Atma-Anatma (moksha is reality)

Claiming moksha as my swarupam = new format, new mindset
