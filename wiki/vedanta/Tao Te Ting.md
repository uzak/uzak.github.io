Everyone thinks of themselves as capable and outstanding while I appeared unlearned.   
A virtuous person never forces his way and hence will not make faults.   
  
Thus, a kind person is the teacher of the unkind.  
An unkind person is a lesson for the kind to learn.  
  
It is the empty space in the room that gives its function.  
Therefore, something substantial can be beneficial.  
While the emptiness of void is what can be utilized.   
  
The wise does not speak.   
  
Many words lead to exhaustion.  
It is better to center on the true essence within.   
  
Water benefits all things and contends not with them.  
It puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be and thus is closest to Tao.  
A virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to the perfect place.   
  
Wealth and treasures are but illusions that one cannot possess.  
  
Thus, honor is based on humbleness.   
  
In pursuing Tao, one is enlightened with the true nature and thus diminishes daily one’s worldly desires and knowledge.  
The continuous depletion of one’s desires persists until one acts accordingly to the natural Way.  
By acting without personal intention enables one to accomplish all things.  
  
The saint trusts those who are trustworthy.  
He also trusts those who are not trustworthy.   
  
Hence, a saint does not strive to do something great.   
  
I have Three Treasures that I hold and guard.  
The first is Kindness.  
The second is Simplicity.  
The third is Humbleness.   
With Kindness, one can be courageous.  
With Simplicity, one can be generous.  
With Humbleness, one can be the lead to provide guidance.   
  
A faithful Tao cultivator does not use force.  
A good warrior does not lose his temper.  
A great conqueror does not challenge others.  
A good leader is humble.  
  
One who pretends to know what he is ignorant of, is at fault.   
  
Thus a saint acts without holding on to the achievements.  
He accomplishes but does not claim for credit.  
He has no desire to distinguish himself.   
  
The Tao of Nature,  
Does not contend, yet easily wins.  
Does not speak, yet always responds.  
Does not summon, yet all things gather.  
Does not contemplate as if at ease,  
Yet all plans were devised perfectly.   
The Law of Nature is like a giant web,  
Although sparsely meshed, nothing can slip through.  
  
People would then enjoy the simple food, simple clothing, and be contented with a simple life.   
  
The wise one does not argue.  
He who argues is not wise.   
  
The Way of a saint is to act naturally without contention.   
  
A saint does not possess and accumulate surplus for personal desire.  
The more he helps others, the richer his life becomes.  
The more he gives to others, the more he gets in return.   
--  
Therefore, a saint cultivates himself with introspection and self-discipline without blaming others for faults.   
Hence, a person of virtue acts as if he were the debtor.   
  
The Tao of Nature is impersonal which makes no exception to anyone.  
It always assists those that are kind and virtuous.  
  
When a plant is alive, it is soft and flexible.  
When it is dead, it becomes dry and brittle.  
Therefore, hard and rigid shall lead to death.  
Soft and gentle shall lead to life.   
Thus, a strong army with rigid force shall not win.  
A thick and big tree will be cut down for its use.  
The big and strong will take an inferior position.  
The soft and gentle will take superior position.   
  
He who makes promises easily seldom keeps his words.  
He who constantly regards things as easy shall result in difficulty.   
  
The saint realizes his true nature and hence does not distinguish himself.   
  
He who acts with desire shall fail.  
He who tries to possess shall lose.   
  
Most people fail when they are near completion.   
  
The ancient Tao cultivators,  
Did not lead people to acquire knowledge to be tricky,  
But to guide them to restore their simplicity and innocence.  
The reason people are difficult to be governed is because they are clever and witty.   
  
Harmonize with the glory.  
Mix with the lowliness.   
Because the wise is unified with all and has no distinction,   
  
I have no personal desires,   
Manage without intentional concern.  
Taste without desire of the flavor.   
Hold the same regard for big or small, abundant or little and reward the unkind with kindness.  
Plan for the difficult while it is easy.   
  
Simplicity is to restrain one’s desires.   
  
A great nation rules by placing itself in a lowly position like the rivers that flow into the low regions of ocean.   
  
Tao gives birth to all things.  
And Te (virtue) nurtures them.  
Matter shapes them.  
The natural environment matures them.   
Therefore, all things abide by Tao and honor Te.   
Hence, Tao gives life to all beings and Te nurtures, grows, fosters, develops, matures, supports, and protects them.   
  
Great tone has no sound.  
Great Tao is formless,  
It is invisible and has no name.  
It benefits all and fulfills all.   
  
The greatest crime is to have too much desire.  
The greatest disaster is not to find contentment.  
The greatest mistake is to desire for endless possession.  
Hence, when one is gratified with self-contentment,  
True contentment can then long endure.   
  
Because a saint does not restrict himself with the greatness,  
Hence his greatness is accomplished.   
  
Gentleness overcomes strength, and the meek overcomes the strong.  
  
A person of knowledge and self-opinion will be hindered from the enlightenment of Tao.   
  
To know the strong masculine principle, yet abide by the gentle female principle is like being the valley of the world where all rivers will flow into.  
  
Therefore, one who follows the true nature will understand the principle of cause and effect and shall not rely upon the strength of force.   
By knowing the effect, although one has no choice, one still abides with the principle of cause and effect and does not resolve into force  
  
When Tao is manifested, names were given for the purpose of distinction.   
  
Transcend the saint’s teaching and conceal one’s wisdom for potential use, shall benefit the people a hundred fold.  
  
I am calm and peaceful like the boundless ocean.   
  
To be in need is to possess.   
To be hollow is to be filled.   
  
Although he is surrounded by the splendor of wealth, he remains to live a simple and ordinary life.   
  
Therefore, he who values the world as much as he values himself, can be entrusted with the ruling of the world.  
He who loves the world as much as he loves himself, can be entrusted with the guidance of the world.   
  
Those who are not content with fame is like polishing the edge of a knife.  
The sharper it gets, the easier it is to break.  
The nature Tao teaches one to retreat after one’s success and not to hold on to the credit.   
  
A person of great virtue is like the flowing water.  
  
Although he is not self-concerned, finds himself accomplished.   
It is because he is not focused on self-interests and hence can fulfill his true nature.   
  
By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall into dispute.  
By not valuing the hard to get objects, people will not become robbers.  
By not seeing the desires of lust, one’s heart will not be confused.
