# Software Engineering

## Complexity
* Coding is about creating code
* Software Engineering is about managing complexity - creating structure
    * We want simple code, so that humans can understand it easily, without wasting mental resources.


* Structure
    * Pyramid vs. labyrint
        * any new level constructs a new game (level). until game over at the top
    * Structure (vertical) vs one more (copy & paste; horizontal)
    * Computer is a one-more machine; waving 
    * Human intellect can construct structure from what it has at disposal
    * Automation: one more -> structure
    * Divide and conquer; thinking; ordering
    * Problem solving; odyssey
    * Vertical vs. horizontal structure
        * serialize vs. parallelize


chunking, 7 +/- 2
light vs. matter
structure sometimes need to change (when one new comes around). that's SWE process.


* Divide and Conquer
* Method of loci, mushrooms, recall
* chess
    peon vs. knight (includes all)

## Documentation
* Not having to map the labyrint by oneself, but having a pyramid at disposal.

## [Refactoring](Refactoring)

## [Testing](Testing)
* Tests are the scaffolding for your structure. They verify that structure once constructed doesn't fall.
