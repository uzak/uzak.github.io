Protective/copyleft (GPL) vs. permissive/BSD-style.

# MIT
- **simple**, most popular on github (51%).
- **software is provides as is** - copyright holders are not liable for any claims or liabilities.
- derivates can be produced, entitlement to commercial benefits from the sale thereof.
- GPL compatible, but not viral like GPL.
- future licensed software must contain a copy of the license and copyright notice.
 
# Apache 2.0
- second most popular on github (14%), **also handles patents**.
- clearly defines rules regarding patent and redistribution rights
- derivates must provide a copy of Apache 2.0 license. Derivates must retain all copyright, patent and attribution notices form the original SW sources.
- Must notify users of code modifications. 
- If the original includes attribution notices (within a NOTICE file), derivates must also include the NOTICE file.
 
# BSD
- suitable **for long-term research projects which require near-zero licensing costs** and freedom to commercialize research results. Can help minimize legal and organizational overhead with open-source projects
- 0-clause BSD: public domain license which doesn't even require attribution: *Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted.*
- 2-clause BSD (similar to MIT license): 
    - *Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.*
    - *Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.*
- 3-clause modified (BSD): +
    - *Neither the name of the [organization] nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.*
- 4-clause BSD: +
    - *All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgement: This product includes software developed by the [organization].*

# GPL
- doesn't prohibit users from selling derivates, but it requires source code of the derivates also to be freely available (reciprocity obligation).
