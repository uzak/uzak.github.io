But it was most importantly a story of hostile takeovers. Step by step increase our influence, push in our representatives and so on. There could pass a century between the establishment of actual control and formal annexation.</li><li>Somehow many observers presume that we can ignore the economic context of Russian expansion. They ascribe it to ideological, historical, religious motives. That might not be wrong. But this expansion is critically dependent upon technological import and thus can not proceed without a constant flow of export goods.</li><li>Therefore, maintaining these export flows is a matter of first and foremost importance for the Russian leadership. Their priorities are: to secure the extraction of natural resources, and secure their export to the West. Without taking this into account we can’t understand either Oprichnina, nor Putinomics. Basically we can summarise priorities of the latter as building seaports, railways and pipelines. Everything to secure the continuous export of natural resources.`</li></ol><div class=music></div></div><footer class=post-footer></footer></article></div></body></html>
