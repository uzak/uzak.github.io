&lt;h1 id=&quot;satsang-2021-08-03&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz3kr2TDLFA&quot;&gt;Satsang 2021-08-03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right way to listen to a speaker is to set aside your knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; Knowledge - accumulation. You neither agree nor disagree with the speaker. The idea is to think about it and that is how we learn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of meditations can be classified as fancy or imaginations. Sometimes this fancy or imaginations acquires a status of tradition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Law of repetition: whenever there is repetition it is bound to become a cult. Then it blunts the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is meditation a practice or state of consciousness into which the mind comes very smoothly and abides in that? Effort -&amp;gt; karma -&amp;gt; karma phalam… True meditation is effortlessness itself. That requires &lt;strong&gt;huge sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;. When you’re attentive there are no thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Effort brings in the element of time. &lt;strong&gt;Anything where time comes in will bind you.&lt;/strong&gt; Real freedom - time is not involved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Inner) &lt;strong&gt;simplicity in life&lt;/strong&gt;. A mind free from ambition, competition, scheming… A mind which believes it has achieved is not a simple, humble mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetition is when there is memory.&lt;/strong&gt; Memory converts experience into repetition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buddha was the first teacher of vedanta. Walking all his life. Giving one lecture in the morning and one in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is fear only because you seek pleasure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When there is fear, there is cruelty.&lt;/strong&gt; Like sacrificing an animal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A heart filled with fear can’t know what is love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pleasure, fear, cruelty is hallmark of ritualism. This is what Buddha dismissed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-1&quot;&gt;Class 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditation is state of consciousness where there the ideas of effort and reward are not present. There is only attention, that does not exclude anything.&lt;/strong&gt; Attention of what is. It liberates and transforms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I do not do meditation, I come into meditation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:vakya - sentence. In this case “tat tvam asi”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:vrtti - function. Function of the sentence (tat tvam asi).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primary meaning vs. secondary meaning (lakshanah).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you know your self, you’ve known God. There is no other way of knowing God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it comes to jnana section of the Veda, primary meaning is put aside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Masses - always wanting something or the other. Undisciplined. With a collective consciousness of fear and want.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People find it difficult to be humble because they have a sense of achievement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you learn you’re not a follower any more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abheda garbha namaskara: I’m praying to a god who is within me and non-different from myself. Vimala bodhakanam namami.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything 100% like sugar, salt is called &lt;strong&gt;crystal - ghana. Homogeneous. Monolithic.&lt;/strong&gt; Here ghana of knowledge (boddha) of the self. Knowingness in which there is no knowing. Knowing this or knowing that is already contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The bigger it includes the bigger but the lesser doesn’t include the bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is not a prayer from periphery to the center. This is the prayer where the center explodes and merges in the whole.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Out of my own knowledge I create, I sustain in my own knowledge and I take it back when I go to sleep. You sustain a city - that is the power of human thought. You can understand the infinite power of brahman only when you look at your own power. Acintya zakyam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can create illness for you, you can cure your own illness if the doctor cannot cure. The lord who created all commands all. &lt;strong&gt;You created a world for yourself and you command it. Nobody can make you miserable except yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; Now, am I describing the brahman or am I describing you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman also makes mess. He created dharma and adhmara. Hell and heaven. Hero and the villain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The moment you create a form you made a form you become a sect. People who hold on to one particular form are divisive, sectarian and not in sync with the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ananta murti: in reality brahman has infinite forms. You are also one form. Even silly gold can have infinite forms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two options: either hold on to all the forms or embrace the formless. Both are the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bondage briefly: general sense of sorrow and fear. Idea like presently not all is well with me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of want - foundation for complete sense of well being. Freedom. Settlement. Sometimes sorrow might come, but it will also go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When children are playing, they’re in bliss. When you watch them, they stop playing and become shy. There is bliss in you but somehow you’re an obstacle to what is in you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need a mirror&lt;/strong&gt; to see your self, &lt;strong&gt;to enjoy your self. For brahman, the mirror is the maya shakti called shrI. One loves the image in the mirror. The image in the mirror is different yet not different from herself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6RPfeCONfY&quot;&gt;Class 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Duty. In the language of Gita: svakarma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The being is first and foremost in you, then only elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do your study with all the love and enthusiasm. In doing so, you’re worshiping Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;True religion vs. religion of the masses. Vedantic religion vs. popular religion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swami: I never liked the philosophy that a person is unhappy today because in his childhood his parents have done something to him. This has become a big psychological law. Maybe actions were wrong here and there. But the intent was clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatever happened in the past, put it aside. Live in the present.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you accept on person as a guru that day your learning has come to an end.&lt;/strong&gt; From who so ever we learn, he’s the guru.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The right (outer) guru is the one who takes you to the inner guru. Gurus of the world don’t tell you the truth. They maintain the disease so you are patient year after year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All is myself. My diamond ring - it is not carbon anymore, it is myself. &lt;strong&gt;I’m projecting myself outside and relating to it as though it is other than myself.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m the only reality in this entire creation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:prasada = benediction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I care to understand the all-pervading Vishnu is in me and not different from me. Aham eva vishnuh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God made you or we made god? There is no god other than godliness.&lt;/strong&gt; God sounds like a person. Convert god into impersonal. The god you’re worshiping is not outside but in you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;River is a projection. Bank is a projection. It is prthivi. You give names and believe they are real. &lt;strong&gt;Everything is a projection. The one who projects is real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The guru is the one who shows the way back home which is your real self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mahatma has clarity of thinking. He’s not confused. He sees/understands things as they are. Entire world is confused. People see things as they imagine. Jeweler sees gold, people see ornaments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To think of god you have to experience some insufficiency or deficiency in you. You have to think of yourself as limited as small.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Vedic vision god is impersonal. Puranic people have converted it into personal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you say “God” you always feel separation. When you say godliness the separation is not so strong. What you call jiva is a bundle of desires and fears. As that you’re separate from God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satguru is the guru who takes your attention to the (inner) guru in you. Satguru is the adma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow the mind to be silent and you’ll experience pure consciousness. Once the mind projects the body you’re the body. Once it projects the riches you’re the rich man. Once it projects the gender, you’re a man/woman. If it projects nothing, you’re the pure light of consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIbjTlyr2XY&quot;&gt;Class 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tapatraya. Worldly life throws three challenges on us. Nobody is exempt. Tapas - suffering, intense discomfort (associated with intense heat). 1) physical. Body is sick in all kinds of ways 2) elements around us 3) gods. Sending unseen enemies like corona virus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:arca - blazing sun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Life is full of conflicts among humans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entertainment is an industry. There is so much boredom in lives of people. Shut it down and people will go crazy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nobody seems to know the meaning of life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are caught in self-centered activity of ambition, competition and status seeking. People want to achieve something all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re caught in our own thoughts all the time. People can’t stop thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superstitions. In popular religion people can’t tell the difference between superstition and facts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Routine of habit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Psychological dependence upon faith, religion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you’re dependent there is fear. Fear and psychological dependence go together. When there is fear, there is conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tourism. Celebrations. You’re escaping from yourself. One of the biggest escapes is religion. In the mean-time old age comes. It comes much sooner than we expect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everybody is looking for a leader. People want to follow. Followers will destroy the leader and the leader will destroy the followers. That is not the way to escape samsara. A spiritual leader should encourage learning, not worshipping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to equip yourself with shama (mind), dama (body functions). So you can be with yourself for a length of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re a good student you’ll find a good guru. &lt;strong&gt;A good guru is one who has no agenda for you.&lt;/strong&gt; He’s not looking for some reward. &lt;strong&gt;He’s the one who is encouraging you to discover the truth in yourself by yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; One who points to the inner guru, atma - be a light unto yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total attention is when the mind becomes entirely quiet. Then you experience yourself as he pure consciousness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFih9T7nSTM&quot;&gt;Class 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:bhagavAn - one who’s revered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is enough to revere the teacher, you need not worship him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bondage we’re talking of is bhava bandhana. bhava - worldliness. You don’t need thrills. They will destroy people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t matter whether you’re sick or healthy. Cycle of pleasure and pain is a problem. Worldly people get accustomed to this problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is so much effort from the people to grab a piece of happiness.&lt;/strong&gt; It shows that we’re very unhappy. That’s bhava bandana.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose I don’t seek any happiness what so ever. That is freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effortlessness doesn’t mean you sit in a corner and rot.&lt;/strong&gt; If life is sedentary, you’ll become sick. That is not Vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People believe sadhana means intense effort. Effort determines the outcome elsewhere. Not here. How much effort should you put in to get good sleep?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more punishing, the more reward. This doesn’t work.  &lt;strong&gt;You’re carrying a huge stone on the head. Stop carrying it. That’s vayragyam.&lt;/strong&gt; Raga is opposite of vayragyam which is freedom. And vayragyam is effortless.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dialogue is very characteristic for Vedanta. Everywhere else you’re learning about something that is not you. Meaning of a dialogue, a student going to a teacher, is about learning life and oneself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buddha: nobody can hurt you. Only you yourself can hurt you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maturity: he he’s had successes and failures, he’s been exhausted by karmas. He wants something that is effortless now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three states of the mind: distracted, concentrated and alert.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You work and work and work you feel tired. Happily. &lt;strong&gt;Physical fatigue is very good for health. Whereas emotional fatigue is very bad for health. Intellectual fatigue is very good for health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concentrated mind is recommended by the hathayoga people. &lt;strong&gt;Concentration of the mind is the punishment. The problem is exclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; It demands tremendous energy, makes you conflicted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In alertness (sAvadhAna) nothing is excluded. It makes you healthy. It is your true nature. There is no effort involved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity of though: No way silly emotion will come into it. No personal prejudices have a role to play.&lt;/strong&gt; In Vedanta no way the clarity of thought should be compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sri Krishna uses more the word “seeing” than “knowing”. The one who knows Niagara doesn’t know Niagara. The one who sees Niagara now knows the Niagara. We’re 2nd hand people, we don’t know what is 1st hand. All our religion is 2nd hand. There is nothing experiential in it. Idam tad iti - this is that! Direct perception. Apperception.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose I realize I need not seek happiness from the world. It cannot and need not give any happiness to me. That is freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; That is 1st hand knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generally people only quote others. That is 2nd hand knowledge. If I quote from the reverence, but the knowledge is mine, that’s 1st hand knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re looking for emancipation, not redemption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can jnanam have a reward? Karma will give you a reward. But emancipation is not the outcome of an effort.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose you are grieving. You’re grieving because of a misapprehension. You go to a mahatma and he shows a mirror to you: Look at yourself! You’re holding to a false notion. Suppose the person understands - the grief is gone. Grief is there only because of false notion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Study of nyaya (indian logic), or other dualistic philosophies, doesn’t help in understanding advaita vedanta at all. Vedanta is neither divisive nor logic. It is oneness and love. Rather than studying nyaya make some money, enjoy life and come to Gita and get liberated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9vTIX1y3M4&quot;&gt;Class 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“How” is relevant when something is a process. You’re not a process. You’re yourself without any respect to place and time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m with my self, the world is completely shut off. The world experience comes to a grinding halt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is nothing short of a miracle that I sustain the world (which is the world experience) in myself. So much so I can stop it. Just by being with myself. Simply I am. I alone am.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can put aside the world-experience at will or I can bless the world-experience to continue. I’m the master of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only rarely somebody wants the freedom from worldliness. People are interested in artha, kama and then dharma (for reaching other worlds). Heaven is a copy of this world, just more refined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you gain this knowledge but you do not realize it, it just remains conceptual knowledge, slowly it becomes poison. You get false notion that you’re a vedantin.&lt;/strong&gt; And then you may consider yourself as a teacher of Vedanta. &lt;strong&gt;The process of learning has abruptly come to an end.&lt;/strong&gt; Poison: this kind of knowledge makes a person egoic, arrogant, hottie. Jnanam: something you understand first hand, within yourself. You know it yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Tat tvam asi” can do it. What you want to be you already are. This simple and practical it is. Teacher cannot do it for you. You have to give it a chance. You’re free from sorrow. Otherwise I cannot help you with your sorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is very legitimate to do whatever it takes to be happy. The happiness you’re seeking you already are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The moment you say supreme power, God, Ishvara a schism is created. It sounds like it is other than you. If you say paramatma, supreme-self…&lt;/strong&gt; God is God in the clouds. Paramatma is ocean. To experience water, to which part of the ocean you have to go? It doesn’t matter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever difference you feel/perceive/conceive between the supreme self and you is the essence of ignorance.&lt;/strong&gt; It only shows that you do not know the glory of your own self. This is the story of &lt;strong&gt;Hanuman. He’s to leap across the ocean. The thing is he can, but he doesn’t know that he can.&lt;/strong&gt; But Jambavan knew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schism between what you imagine yourself to be presently: crying, begging, unhappy living entity and what you are: supreme self, embodiment of happiness. You’ve to cross that division. That’s leap across the ocean. That journey is not in space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tadatmya&lt;/strong&gt; - oneness. That is this and this is that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somebody wanted heaven (or hell). The kingdom of heaven is within you. You can create both.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re under the kalpavrksha - wield yielding tree - with the name of tatvamasi. It is in you. You want to be unhappy? -&amp;gt; You become unhappy. You feel you’re old? -&amp;gt; Then you’re old. Oh my legs don’t cooperate too much -&amp;gt; they don’t. I can learn! -&amp;gt; you can learn. I will make everybody happy -&amp;gt; you make everybody happy. Tatvamasi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tat - that understanding = idam - this direct perception. tadatmya vishayam jnanam, tat idam mukti sadhanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The moment you recognise the folly it goes away. You’ve to discover the inner fullness. Every soul is potentially divine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The scripture tells you to go and do the puja only if you believe to be the doer. The scripture says don’t do bad things because you’ll get papa. The scripture doesn’t say you’re the doer. You say you’re the doer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t connect the higher and lower paradigms. Only when you’re a doer, you’re responsible for the outcome of the action. For the higher, there is no action, no doer, no result, nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsHebGqfg-c&quot;&gt;Class 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body fits into the medical science only when it is “the body”, not “my body”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can you come out of the “me” and “mine” syndrome?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The world is not real because it is limited and it will perish. The real is unlimited. Brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proverb in Telugu: “The goat always believes the butcher”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speech is the link between the thought and action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In entire Phoenix, &lt;strong&gt;can you find a person who is not in search of something or the other?&lt;/strong&gt; And all that search is in vain. When you do not yourself, your search is in vain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can there be life without relationships? No.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without knowing myself properly, there cannot be any meaningful relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing oneself is not opposed to relationship, not opposed to the society.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You do not need what you think you need.&lt;/strong&gt; You need only to know yourself. Nothing else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If somebody is talking very complex things, he’s not talking the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To believe is very easy, to look at oneself requires tremendous sensitivity. Keep healthy mind in healthy body then you’ll have it to examine the issues of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENvXT9U9dxs&quot;&gt;Class 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we’re trained to be isolated persons. &lt;strong&gt;The person comes from the thought process&lt;/strong&gt; - conditioning of the mind. Minus the mind there is no person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comedy helps to &lt;strong&gt;drop the person&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The so called “secret things” I collect and make a person out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t find “me” and the sorrow separately. The sorrow/fear/dissatisfaction itself is the “me”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conflict itself is the person.&lt;/strong&gt; When the person is negated, the conflict is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In religious context you always say “aham”, “mama”. The person is there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Objectify the body, watch the body. Similarly objectify that person, the ego. That takes you to the spirit. This is the foundation of “sakshi bhava” - being the witness of the person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is some conflict be a sakshi to that conflict and see what happens with it. That takes you out of the &lt;strong&gt;psychological dimension, which is a prison, not your home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;citti samjnana -&amp;gt; cit (ending “i” is an marker)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Table is not solid. It is 99.99% void / space. “Solid” you get by the impression of the touch. Body is not a thing, it is an idea in the mind. Bhagavan buddha said: “body is a wave”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a body only when you think of a body. That is the foundation of the anesthesia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If body is not the thing what is the thing? Caitanyam&lt;/strong&gt; is the thing, it is what is. Like in a movie, all you see is not a thing. Light is the thing, nothing else. Everything else is phenomenological.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for what is. That is how the search for the truth goes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ll not be able to appreciate ananda, as long as you seek pleasure. You’ll not the joy of good health as long as you eat spicy and tasty food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shanti - subsiding, dousing (of the mind). Shanti = ananda = true joy != pleasure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vigraha - matrix. The stuff which the appearing is made from. The essence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kim na prapatyase - why don’t you realise/understand?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The person, along with all its problems, is a phantom. Phantasmagoria. To understand that you need to have a quiet mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christ: “when somebody slaps you on the right cheek, show him the left one”. Means that &lt;strong&gt;his home is not the hurt body mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e54QKx9QL90&quot;&gt;Class 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 levels: matter, energy, intelligence - the spirit. You’ve to look at yourself correctly. Otherwise whole life becomes a punishment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is nothing like missing anything.&lt;/strong&gt; Mahatmas who know anything are like wind, they come in and they go out. No identification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever you notice you’re getting annoyed, tell yourself you’re chitananda shivoham.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best service you can do to the society is take away one ignorant guy from the society.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long you feel I’m a punjabi as long you’ll say I’m satchitananda. Did I ever tell you the village I was born? I do not identify with space. Did I ever tell you my age, birthday? I did not identify with time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose I feel “I’m swami TV”. That’s only a name. What is there in a name?&lt;/strong&gt; The rose smells as sweet even when you call it by any other name (Shakespeare).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m the witness to the ever changing moods of the mind (time) and states of the body (space)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A mask is intrinsically a piece of cloth with two strings attached. It is not (intrinsically) a mask.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body is not flesh. Feet until loins - prthivi. Abdomen - apah. Tummy - fireplace. Chest - vayu. Neck and above - space. You’re not the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you get out of the discovery that you’re not the body? Nothing positive. But great freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business guy is money-conscious. Soccer player is goal-concious. While cooking you’re conscious of the dish … &lt;strong&gt;most of the time you’re not body conscious. You’ve to overcome the residual body-identity.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ve to dismantle structures which promote body identity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You cannot control the body. That is not in your hand. But you can stop identifying with the body -&amp;gt; feeling of lightness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normally &lt;strong&gt;people live a living of craving and fear. Because we’re identified with the body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pot half filled with water is the same as the body. A bunch of panca-bhutas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physician treats the body, not the person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You do not identify so much with the body as with the attributes of the  body: age, gender etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHLd-Te7N0k&quot;&gt;Class 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’d be able to say “I don’t know” only then your mind is open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If Vedanta becomes conceptual it just becomes another kind of religion. Only nomenclature changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay with it for a time, contact a physician by all means, but don’t battle the illness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In life you have to ask the question: &lt;strong&gt;did you put some goal in-front of you and you’re running to it so it can be put behind you?&lt;/strong&gt; That is insanity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat any number of times: I’m not the body, I’m the one who knows the body. You have to deal with the body-identification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implication of never being born is never going to die.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it comes to self-knowledge, cheating doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t you ever make a big issue out of birth and death. There is nothing like birthday.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space is freedom. Develop inner space.&lt;/strong&gt; Begin with the body. &lt;strong&gt;“Body is ill” - there is space. “I’m ill”- there is no space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need as much outer space as you believe. Leo Tolstoy: you need 6 feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you have an inkling that you’re not the body that is the intimation of the infinite. That is self-knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge is always in the present. Never in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t make a goal out of the self to be reached in the future. You’re the self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gravitation is space (akasha) -&amp;gt; kinetic energy (vayu) -&amp;gt; heat / radiation -&amp;gt; water / electricity -&amp;gt; magnetism (prthivi). In gravitation there is only attraction, no opposites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;String theory - everything is only space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeing is not effort, doing is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pot is the seeing. I’m the seer. Pot has a shape. I have no shape. Pot was born and will die. I the seer was never born and am never going to die. Pot is insentient, &lt;strong&gt;I’m sentient - I know myself and also the pot. Where the pot doesn’t know itself and anything else&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mahatma being sick: today you can ask only questions where there is no body identification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See, what are all the areas, where the body ID is ruling, recognize it and dismantle them. Suppose I’m putting color to my hair - that is body Id.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the spirit and the matter interact, the matter doesn’t leave any residue in the spirit and the spirit doesn’t leave any residue in the matter&lt;/strong&gt;. Conduct yourself as you’re not the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jesus of Nazareth became Christ only after crucification. You have to crucify yourself. What is the crucification? Realise I’m not the body. How? &lt;strong&gt;Don’t act on behalf of the body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vasudeva acarya: you’re accusing the annamaya, the body, not me. I’m not the food body. What are you? Take seat and I will tell you in the class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCyGA8bULIM&quot;&gt;Class 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The one alone not seeking happiness is happy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you walking or are you aware of walking? By practising the walking meditation you’ll realize yourself as the witness of walking. Same for speech meditation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is the teaching. But you do not feel like a teacher, you do not look at yourself as a teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As long as you entertain the sense of doership your mind will be disturbed under stress. &lt;strong&gt;The day you realize you’re not the doer you’ve discovered timeless peace of mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re seeing a plant -&amp;gt; you’re aware of the seeing. Like an optometrist looking at your seeing of the letters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You not only hear (ID with the function) but also you know that you’re hearing (dis-ID).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Close the eyes. The eyes are not seeing any forms but you know you’re seeing. I see that the eyes do not see now. That is what you are. Not just a mere function of eyes. You’re the eye of the eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The way to do it is to &lt;strong&gt;stop with the ID habit&lt;/strong&gt;, which is in the worldly people - readily identifying with every - and anything. No mine, no me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not identifying -&amp;gt; humility. Identification -&amp;gt; arrogance, egoism.&lt;/strong&gt; Not pretended humility -&amp;gt; truth shines -&amp;gt; everybody loves you. When you’re humble, there is freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at the lighted cellphone screen makes the mind very agitated, restless, blunted and dull. In the old-age you’ll have neurological issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature never forgives, nature never respects personalities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to engage the intellect in productive use. Use it or lose it, never identifying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind like glass appears to be self-shining. C’mon, glass doesn’t shine. It only appears so because it is transparent. It is the sun that shines. Mind is so subtle and so close to the atma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spirit - source of knowingness. That is shining. Mind is so close that it appears to be shining by itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot stand yourself if you cannot be with yourself. How do you think others will stand you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be alone and look at the mind, see what’s going on. Some chatter, seeking is going on all the time. Do it and you’ll not be bothered. Suddenly minds gets quiet. Instead of watching the mind I became one with the mind that’s why it is going somewhere and you become alert - ID has broken.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Silence and spaciousness go together. Thought has bounds. Silence has no bounds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are two things taken wrongly as love by people. Lust (attachment) and cupidity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Difference (by inference) between a cadaver a living person is prana. Somebody says I want to live longer - ID with prana. Essence of non-ID with prana - vipashyana meditation of Buddha - watching the breath. You realise yourself as the witness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Witness is not a person. The identifier is a person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When there is an emotion. Sit down, close the eyes if necessary and step back - watch the emotion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of the misfortune alone you have so many clients for the astrologers, numerologist, there are so many crowds in the temple, ashrams… No misfortune -&amp;gt; swamis will not have any sisyas with them. But people present a facade in-front of the sorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People learn only from misfortune. Great poets come from sorrow. A poet and a philosopher know the sorrow and have digested it. Normal people can’t and suffer. Befriend the sorrow. Step back and watch it. Use it to your advantage. Sorrow -&amp;gt; metamorphosis (-&amp;gt; wisdom/poetry).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the jealousy and don’t identify with it. It will get digested.&lt;/strong&gt; Establish yourself as the witness. Emotionalism (ID with mind) has no value.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loving, quit, wise, understanding but not emotional. That is where you reach by not ID with the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you know the non-self as the non-self you become free from the non-self.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhagavan creates human beings. Who created the son? Son creates the father (drsti-srsti vada, for advanced students). Not father creates the son (srsti-drsti vada, for beginners). &lt;strong&gt;Child is the father of the man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ajata vada - zenith of the wisdom. No creation. Mandukya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Children - bundles of rajoguna. &lt;strong&gt;When people are given to a lot of rajoguna, give karmakanda to them. They don’t deserve atmajnanam. When they are saturated with the world, give them atmajnanam.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a place for everything in the scheme of things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The parents want their children to hold to their values so in adulthood they follow their way of live. It is a mechanism to dominate and possess the children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Children have to be terrestrials, play in the mud, not celestials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=-MIgQowEegg&quot;&gt;Class 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditation: if you keep the posture from memory, it becomes something which you repeat. When the posture is fresh, it is not a practice, because there is no time in it. &lt;strong&gt;Time is memory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you repeat the posture, you create the time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind is memory. Mind is the parasite. Mind is the knowledge in terms of accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind becoming silent is the same as dropping the memory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paradox: the answer has to come from the mind which is knowledge, past, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here is a question without answer: “Who am I”? &lt;strong&gt;The seeking of answers is the past-time of the mind.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t allow the mind to intervene.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you the present or are you the past? People are the past history walking around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Astrologist are the bluff-masters. They tell you something about the past and sell is as future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tomorrow is Monday? That is past (no matter what day)! &lt;strong&gt;Whatever mind projects and gives the label “future” is also past.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Life is present. Living is past. People know only the living. Wake up and don’t allow the past to be flooding. Tat tvam asi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you don’t give names all you see is brahman. Sarvam khalvidam brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be loving, don’t be emotional (mind).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t admit a thing called assembly in addition to its parts, the word “part” has no meaning. Vedantins and bauddhas do not admit assembly.&lt;/strong&gt; Implication: there is nothing like body distinct from individual parts. And you can’t call them call parts either.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge as accumulation binds you&lt;/strong&gt;. Village guy who did not accumulate knowledge is free like wind. Philosophers don’t look at the body as a separate thing in its own right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pancha bhutas are material things. Not the body. It is an idea in the mind. There is body only when you think of the body. Basis for anesthesiology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practice generous indifference about the assembly, dis-ID with it. &lt;strong&gt;When you give status you make it real.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a phenomenon - appearance in the flow of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wherever you are interested, that will bind you.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose you walk to a shop and get interested. You become customer and consumer. A small wheel in the giant wheel of consumerism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wise man moves around the trees not taking himself for one. Same for body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sun is, other than is, it doesn’t perform anything.&lt;/strong&gt; Whereas the living beings function all time. Time is there only when there is movement (therefore function). Sun is timelessly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pot is unreal. Real is already occupied by clay. When you touch “pot”, you’re touching clay. What you smell, taste is clay…&lt;/strong&gt; The real! When you weight it: 100g clay, 0g pot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusion can be based on similarity: snake and rope. Or conditioning: pot and clay.&lt;/strong&gt; Tarzan knows clay. If you put “pot” in-front of him, he’ll say “clay”. He doesn’t know pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGNgEJ-LwjY&quot;&gt;Class 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always look at yourself correctly. Remind yourself of your true nature. Make not the mistake of ID with what you’re not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tattvam is the impersonal truth. &lt;strong&gt;Person is a manufactured phantom by the mind. It is the problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BG 13th chapter - prakuruti purusha vibhaga yogah - distinction between prakuruti (always in flux) and purusha (ever changeless).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is nothing static in this universe. Even when there is an equilibrium, it is an dynamic equilibrium.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prakuruti - prakrstham krtihi - intense and constant motion, flux.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When we fit ourselves into prakuruti, then we’re samsaris. When we understand our true nature as purusha distinct from prakuruti, immobile (kutastah), you’re not a samsari anymore. You’re a realized soul.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All change presupposes a changeless background. Wind is blowing because space is changeless. Waves are change-full because water is changeless.&lt;/strong&gt; Train wagons vs. rails. This is not violation of newtons 3rd law. It applies to prakuruti, has nothing to do with purusha - you. There is no doership in you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are the being, shining as the knowing, in which there is no doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t cook the food. The fire cooks the food. Bertrand Russel: &lt;strong&gt;“I see the flower” is a mistake. Seeing is not an act. And then you’re not a doer.&lt;/strong&gt; Error of judgement. You better say: “The flower is seen”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is your sense of doership that haunts you to no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The false cannot stand scrutiny.&lt;/strong&gt; The moment you examine it is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sense of doership is wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Where action is needed action happens. Man is not the actor. The natural thing happens naturally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you making the tree grow? The same thing happens with the children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example (bringing milk): only the doer can not do a thing. Allow the natural thing to happen naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no free will.&lt;/strong&gt; What is will? Will is not free, that came from some psychology in which the mind is real, jagat is real. Vedanta should not be brought down to the level of psychology. There is only the illusion of free will.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An actor does what whatever he does because the director asked it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are born in samsara. There is no free. &lt;strong&gt;Let’s examine. Will is the desire. Will the sense of doership&lt;/strong&gt;. Your presence makes everything function. Without you, nothing functions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t do things. They are done to you. You’re lived by the cosmic life, you don’t live. You’re not the karta. You’re the karma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is the our constant concern about the welfare of the body that makes the body sick.&lt;/strong&gt; You live with no concern about it and the body will remain in a good place - you seldom become sick. You’re not the one that becomes sick. You’re the immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vikara (change) is not in you. It is in the mind. Wind blowing is not in the space, but in the wind. Nothing ever happens to the space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever you’re in distress, remember soham. Be a light to yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t create an enemy out of the mind. It is neither good nor bad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the mind. The past comes in waves,&lt;/strong&gt; it doesn’t ask for permission. You cannot stop it because you know it only after it came. It covers the mind by the recollection of the past and you’re already sorrowful. &lt;strong&gt;You cannot prevent it. All you have to do - be alert.&lt;/strong&gt; Be aware. Like sky, it was clear 10 min ago, now it is overcast. Be aware.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Vedanta you don’t need progress. You need patience.&lt;/strong&gt; Patience is not from A to B. It is now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desire is you transport into the future. In desire you seek what you do not have in the present.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be &lt;strong&gt;fully devoted to the present. Another name for the present is duty.&lt;/strong&gt; Forget future. Now it is gone. And you live a happy and blissful life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT4te5DaYkk&quot;&gt;Class 13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;alert is cit, present is sat.&lt;/strong&gt; When the mind is calm, you’re that. Otherwise a worldly person. Just by sitting straight, eyes slightly closed mind gets calm and you cross the threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be bored by the peace, serenity of the sat cit. Learn to love the peace of sat chit. I love to be the aware-full being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;satcitanandoham = shivoham = soham = om.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Witness is always relative. Witness with respect to… It must be associated with the witnessed - body/mind and world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sakshi is like daylight. It is (always shining sun-) light from the other side. Daylight is sunlight reflected in the atmosphere.&lt;/strong&gt; Sakshi is in reference to body/mind. Citabhasa - reflection of the atman. Being citabhasa it is really speaking no different from cit, the absolute. Citabhasa, when identified, it becomes the person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Window. From one side it is part of the room, with a size etc. From the other of the unlimited space. Sakshi is window to the truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The movement of the mind must be there to experience the body and the world. If the mind becomes quiet, they vanish. And now the witnessing awareness is not witnessing anymore. It is pure awareness, the atma.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We prefer the falsehood because we’ve invested in the falsehood.&lt;/strong&gt; “Vested interest”. &lt;strong&gt;Psychological dependence.&lt;/strong&gt; (Christ - only when you leave everything you can be my follower).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mahatmas are not inflicted by what all is happening around - body, mind, family, society, world. &lt;strong&gt;In the eye of the cyclone, it is all sunshine, no rain, no wind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is the mind which moves in your presence, because of you, but you’re not the mind. Because of you the body is alive, but you’re not the body.&lt;/strong&gt; Because of you there is a thing called family going on. If you want to take yourself as a family person, forget about sat cit ananda.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re a problem to the family if you identify as a family person. They will love you, how non-demanding, non-attached you’re, by inspired by you when you realize your self as sat cit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In non-ID the body becomes very healthy, seldom it become sick. It doesn’t hurt the body, mind, family, community. It helps them all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you hurry you get worried. When you’re worried you get hurried. Avoid these two.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do the things in a hurry you make more mistakes. Even in the face of a disaster, most challenging situation, you’d not hurry. Remain cool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you’re greedy you’ll be afraid. When you’re attached you’ll be afraid. Sat cit ananda is not for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worry, the hurry, the attachment and the fear you’ve to overcome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear is the foundation of religion.&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you believe? Because you’re afraid. Fear and belief go together. Religion puts so much fear into the minds of the people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In religion it is all authority, and therefore fear, no understanding. In Vedanta, there should be no authority, understanding only.&lt;/strong&gt; When there is authority, you need not think, only believe. When there is thinking, there is no authority. People are lazy, also intellectually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;True religion puts love in you, not fear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negation of ego is perfect relaxation. Ego is tension.&lt;/strong&gt; Ego is high-energy state (like exited electrons).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give up all clinging to the body. All desire. The moment you desire things you’re likely to be disturbed (desire -&amp;gt; fear -&amp;gt; anger). You get into vikara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t have desire, automatically you become free from fear and frustration. Give up also all ambition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you’re depressed. Be on your feet, don’t sit on a sofa. Don’t remain in a room, walk into the open. Walk rapidly, briskly. Hands and legs must move. Then brisk breathing comes. That cheers you up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or within the house, stand in a dark corner. Take in air deeply within. Exhale trough nostrils. Do it rigorously. When breathing, tell yourself - I’m breathing the wind of the universe. Then trough the nostrils, tell yourself, I’m throwing out all laziness, all depression, all ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t be a victim of petty cares. All cares are petty cares.&lt;/strong&gt; Realize yourself as soham.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pratyak - innermost. Timeless journey in a partless land. &lt;strong&gt;Understanding is the journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUjNrRibv3I&quot;&gt;Class 14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would you write notes about yourself? Studying other than yourself, it makes sense. When it comes to yourself you try to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any idea of knowing atma is not acceptable. No objectification. Atma is the knower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Studying atma is learning what all you’re not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To call the bluff of belief a bluff you need courage.&lt;/strong&gt; You need courage to see the false as false. To look at the body as non-self you must be very courageous person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeing false as false is most important. You become free from it. That is moksha, mukti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarity - sadrshyam - is the reason for confusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self is that which knows. It is the knowingness by its very nature, matrix of all nature. Knowingness which appears as all kind of knowledge (knowledge of pot, tree, scriptures, social studies …). Atman is essentially the knowingness. In the presence of atman the mind appears to be the knowing entity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind is insentient, jada. Whatever knows is called cit, cetana. The self. All other is jada. In the present of the self the insentient appears to be knowing. Like the lamp appears to be shining but it is some plasma. &lt;strong&gt;In the presence of the self the insentient mind starts to show brilliantly and therefore you make the mistake of taking the mind as the atman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The body is sick. You’d not say I’m sick. Body appears as the self, is not the self. You’re the atman/knowingness/satcit/sah. Body becomes sick, mind arranges for medicine. It’s between them. We don’t do nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The body and the embodied are not of the same order of reality. Body is time-bound, in space and transient, the embodied is permanent, eternal, space-less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surgeon: two people came for the same surgery. If one has dispassion towards the body, he gets cured easier. The other is obsessed, worried and takes more time to recover.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biggest cruelty you can do to yourself is to identify with the body or mind. Biggest blessing is not to do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trick the mind is playing: it picks up some some sorrow as if it is now and here the fresh thing.&lt;/strong&gt; If you identify with it, then you cannot understand the trick being played upon you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another name for presence is being. That is myself. It shines as the knowing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Difference between dead and live body. &lt;strong&gt;Dead body has no sensation. There is no cit in it. Whereas we live by sensation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First sensation (touch, optical), then thought. There is a gap. In case of looking the gap is so small that we miss it. There is sensation that is immediately followed by a thought that projects name and form.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can you break this habit of converting the sensation into a thought? Meaning you don’t give a name to the sensation. Then there is neither pleasure nor pain. Enjoyership is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought is projection. What else? Look at a young lady. No further projection. You’re free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahatmas have the same sensations as samsaris. But they are beyond plasure/pain cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; Break it. Sometimes there is enjoyment. I’m not seeking it, I’m not against it. I allow the natural thing to happen naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discover the gap between sensation and thought.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mahatmas don’t divide people into good and evil. No sva (our) not para (other). Mahatmas can merge into any family. And they leave any family, just like that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good and evil is thought, not sensation. There is no good and evil in the sensation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those who know how to withhold the thought (=projection) they overcome good and evil, sense of ownership. There is enjoyment, sometimes pleasant, sometimes painful. But you’re not the enjoyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For women it is also soham, not saaham, because there is no gender at the level of atma (nor intellect). It’s the right expression common to all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prakarana is more universal than Upanishad. Upanishad needs some connection to Vedic culture. Prakarana complements what the Upanishad teaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xENr1g9Afpk&quot;&gt;Class 15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;World is what I experience through the window of senses and mind. This understanding makes me the master of the world. I can shut off the world by closing the window. The world experience is over and I’m with myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I’m with myself, there are no desires. There are desires only in the context of world experience. Desirelessness/fearlessness is not a goal, it is the truth of myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need the world experience to project a goal other than myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with the understanding that I’m the witness only.&lt;/strong&gt; This puts an end to all kinds of self-definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve cut ourself from the nature by identification with the body. That becomes curse to the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nowadays temples are devoted to rituals only. There used to be teaching as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’d have the quality of earnestness for Vedanta to own the vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is the desire that generates the fear when fulfilled and the frustration when not fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have an outside guru only, you yourself don’t take up the role of the sat guru, the inner guru, you remain ignorant. &lt;strong&gt;You guide yourself. You be a preceptor unto yourself. You tell yourself I’m the witness only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normal, routine, common, universal experiences are enough if examined carefully to understand your true nature. No need for any mystical experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is it that is aware of the constant change happening to the mind?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m the witness. &lt;strong&gt;The procession is that of the mind. Thought procession.&lt;/strong&gt; Can you be a guide to yourself to remain yourself that you’re not involved? This job the outside guru cannot do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Witness is very much like space. The space is not contaminated by anything it contains.&lt;/strong&gt; If you identify, then you cannot be a witness anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did you notice all the forms of god are human in nature? I’m a form therefore god has to be a (very similar) form. A mental form is as gross as the physical form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advice to householders in BG: keep yajna, tapah, danam in your live. Danam is danam only when you give to the needy and deserving. It must be spontaneous, otherwise you become a professional philanthropist. What you do spontaneous it remains with you, your secret.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you do things spontaneously it is likely to remain all good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t own nothing. You currently posses, have presently with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egiAkznpyZg&quot;&gt;Class 16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have 24h hour identification with body and/or mind, you’ll not be able to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outer light helps you to know everything. Inner light - awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First you become aware of your self. Then of body/mind. Then of the world. &lt;strong&gt;First light of the sun, then everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soham ityavadhAraya - I’m that is to be understood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;states (waking, dreaming, sleeping) belong to the mind. &lt;strong&gt;Sun has no states, it is the same all the time. There is no time in sun.&lt;/strong&gt; Time is there only on the earth. Because earth rotates around itself and the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to get self-confidence? Just recognise your competence. Hanuman (was competent, not confident) - Jambavan discussion. You lack understanding. Know yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incomplete data. There are three states and you take only the data offered by the waking state only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without the unconscious there cannot be conscious. Tree is not possible without the seed.&lt;/strong&gt; The manifest is not possible without the unmanifest. Allow the unconscious to flow into the conscious. How to? Sit in meditation and be silent. When the mind is silent you’re aware but the waking state is no more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without deep-sleep waking state is not even possible. Meditate upon it. Reenact it. You’re there (always), but the mind is not. It brings enormous rest and relaxation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you prove yourself, you need not prove the theological god anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You always know the falsehood only. The truth you’ll not know.&lt;/strong&gt; You yourself are the truth. &lt;strong&gt;What we call knowledge is always knowledge of ignorance alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Idealism: &lt;strong&gt;the hero and the heroine they are inside your head but you see them outside on the screen.&lt;/strong&gt; Realism: what you see outside and is outside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedanta: waking state is idealism. Samsara: waking state is realism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waking up to the truth = knowing better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind is moving, it is the dream. Mind is moving, it is the waking. Mind stops moving, you go to deep sleep. Mind becomes entirely still, even when you’re awake - waking state is no more. Therefore waking state is entirely manufactured by the mind and its movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahmacari cooking upma. What are you cooking? “Brahman”. Swami: &lt;strong&gt;Never ever trivialize this great vision. Don’t ridicule it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no calamities in life. There are only happenstances. It is the ignorant mind that creates misfortunes, calamities, desires by saying this is valuable, this not. Then it creates fears, insecurities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Movie is a passing show. Dream is a passing show. This incident that is going on now is maybe only a passing show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the waking state? It is not a few things that are there. It is a series of experiences. Is it not “coffee there”. It is your “tasking up coffee here”. It is not “your son accomplishing something” but “your experience of son accomplishing something”. Suppose there is a thing which you never experience. Such a thing, does it even exist? It can be imagination only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This world exists only because you’re experiencing it. It is the object of waking experience.&lt;/strong&gt; It hangs by the thread by your experiencing it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experience of nothing (nothingness of the sleep) is also an experience.  Which is illuminated by the inner light of awareness. &lt;strong&gt;In the deep sleep you’re aware of nothing but you’re still aware.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know yourself correctly and be liberated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sakshat - directly. Mind is known directly whereas the world is known through the intermediary of the mind and sense organs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peace of mind, serenity, you’ll experience only when you know you’re not the doer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job is done when you uplift yourself. Nobody uplifts others.&lt;/strong&gt; Things happen. You don’t do. Just like a person riding a camel. Why don’t you put your bag on the camel? Oh, the camel needs to carry already my weight. I better ease it for him by carrying it myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re not the doer of anything.&lt;/strong&gt; A single action is made possible by innumerable elements involved in it. Understand it and be at peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dlNlmAd2ik&quot;&gt;Class 17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absence of experiences is also an experience and once again, I’m aware of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-realization: I’m what I’m.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;one slips into body ID -&amp;gt; animal man. ID with life force, intellect -&amp;gt; normal man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prana and intellect word in tandem. &lt;strong&gt;Prana is blind, buddhi is lame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concepts - feeding people with words (=ideas). Religious life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the cup limit the water? Yes. Does the cup limit the space? No. You can say space is everywhere and is reflecting in the cup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving the purpose, negatively or positively, doesn’t prove reality of it.&lt;/strong&gt; The unreal serves as much purpose as real. An unreal serpent creates as much consequence as a real serpent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waking state is full of opposites. Sukha/dukha. Dharma/adharma. The ground of awareness is not contaminated by either. In that sense it is transcendent. To that extent it is called immanent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walls and the castles do not imprison us. Our false notions imprison us. Once you see the false as false you’re free from the bondage of falsehood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Image - psychological. Word - verbal. Both can’t reach the truth. The actual is beyond the words and images.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Way to listen to the shastra - actualization of what you hear and think and lastly feel. Feeling is deeper than thinking. &lt;strong&gt;Thinking is rupa, word is nama, feeling is the actualization.&lt;/strong&gt; Not needed in religion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Awareness illuminates the body. Body is known to you, shines in the awareness. How can there be ID between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever you see, is outside the eyes. Whatever you’re aware of, is other than the awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; And it is limited. While your awareness you can envelope entire galaxy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can say I’m the sun only when you’re not the body but the awarefull presence. First in the body and then everywhere else. I’m the light of this body and light of this universe. Like the light that illuminates the cup also illuminates the entire hall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What I’m is left open. Nothing concrete is said. The moment you do, you commit a mistake against yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With respect to the body/mind the sakshi is the chitabhasa. With respect to its source its atman absolute.&lt;/strong&gt; Chitabhasa is the window. One side of the window is the sun, the other is the room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-18---love-beauty&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQUPFXhcfs&quot;&gt;Class 18&lt;/a&gt; - love, beauty&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;root(pri) -&amp;gt; priti, priyam etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worldly people do not know what is love. Love is not memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is sorrow? A thought. What is ego? A thought. Thus &lt;strong&gt;only when you think there is the ego.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind collects a few elements and creates a person out of it, the ego. Ego doesn’t know what is love. In the context of ego there is only attachment. Ego is the attachment.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no division.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 10 dollar cellphone is not “my cellphone”. It is “cellphone”, it is a useful thing. A 1000 dollar cellphone is “my cellphone”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ego is attached to (physical) objects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re beautiful, not the flower. Suppose you’re not beautiful, the flower will not be beautiful. &lt;strong&gt;The ego is always outside. The beauty of the atman is in you. It is you. People only know the outward, physical, artificial beauty created by thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I read a verse that is beautiful, listen to some nice things being said by a mahatma, when I see a wild meadow, that is beautiful to me. Not your &lt;strong&gt;carefully orchestrated burden.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The father wants his son to become engineer. Is that possessing and dominating? We want children to think the way we think, to desire what we desire. To fear what we fear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ACID test: in love, there is freedom. &lt;strong&gt;In dominating and possessing there is no freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; Puja Swami: “The amount of freedom you give to the other person is equal to the amount of freedom you get.” Love engenders freedom while attachment is bondage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known is memory, mind, thought. Mind moves from the known to the known only.&lt;/strong&gt; It cannot move from the known to the unknown. &lt;strong&gt;The way to realize the unknown is negating the known.&lt;/strong&gt; Attachment is known to us and therefore we negate the attachment. Approach love negatively, not positively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possession brings out jealousy. When you possess the son, you compare and become jealous. Rank means comparison, and you want a better rank - that is ambition. And you don’t get the rank you desire, that is conflict. And somebody else gets the higher rank - that is jealousy.&lt;/strong&gt; Children don’t have any of these things, unless they evtl. learn from us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Classical mother/daughter in law syndrome is fear of the mother of losing her son.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sensation, sentimentality - emotionalism - is not love. Love can never turn to hatred.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you respect your servant? You respect the boss. That is no respect. Only if you respect the lowliest of the lowly then only you’ll know what is love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the social life, where authority and hierarchy is, the respect you show is not love. In the religious life, the reverence you show to the guru is not the true reverence. There also you go by hierarchy. You divide people.&lt;/strong&gt; That is not love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where there is no respect, there is no love. Similarly when there is no mercy, pity, forgiveness, there is no love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When these things do not occupy your mind, then you’ll know what is love in you heart. Only when you discover love you’ll be transformed. You’ve to discover you’re not the person you think yourself to be. You’re the divinity. Imagine how much inner transformation you need for that? Transmutation!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems, cults, sects, rituals, rituals, celebrations … cannot bring inner transformation. Only love can.&lt;/strong&gt; You do really love only when you not possess, you do not dominate, you’re not envious, not greedy. When you’re respectful, when you’ve mercy, compassion all the way. When you’ve enormous sensitivity for all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the things made of hands occupy your mind,&lt;/strong&gt; like costly classes, costly cell-phone, car, food, parties, attires … &lt;strong&gt;you’ll now know what is love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You do not anything. FYI, you don’t own even your own body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parigraha. Accumulation. The acquisitive spirit. If it occupies your mind, it kills the heart, the love&lt;/strong&gt;. It is the monstrosity of the superstition. There is not an iota of truth in that. When you discover the love&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love of the atman. I love not only my son. I love all the sons. I love all people. I love all animals. I love a blade of grass. I love all. That is what love is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In ego’s attachment there is the fragrance of the love of atman. Even in attachment you experience the joy (of atman) when things go your way.&lt;/strong&gt; In ego’s attachment is sipping of the love of atman. &lt;strong&gt;The love of the self is spilling into your experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a ripe ego the love of the attachment of the son can transform it self to the pure love of the son.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is your inner-most self that is the source of joy, not the experience of SOMETHING. People in their folly believe that SOMETHING makes them happy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you see the Picasso and there is joy it comes not from Picasso but from your self, which is the same as Picasso’s joy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding of this is freedom. Don’t throw away the objects. But then you might even not cling to the objects. When there is time to give up you give up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love of your son should not be auxiliary (shesha) as attachment to the ego. It should be auxiliary as all-encompassing love to the atma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beauty could be attribute of the insentient? Or is it the attribute of the sentient?&lt;/strong&gt; What is beautiful in insentient. Jada cannot have beauty. Beauty is not an attribute of physical things. &lt;strong&gt;Beauty is the innate essence of the inner-most self. That’s why the self experiences everywhere wheres the worldly person has to spend a lot of money to experience the beauty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing but atma is lovable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m is fundamentally the being. But then the being which is shining as the knowing. Suppose you say the “book is” the “is” is the being. But &lt;strong&gt;the book doesn’t shine by itself. It shines only when there is mind, eyesight and the knowingness (atma). Whereas the being shines by itself.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn’t acquire eyesight, mind. It shines by itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decartes went to the restaurant. Waiter: “do you think you need any food?” Decartes: “I think not.” And then he vanished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP98HLyQRa8&quot;&gt;Class 19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detachment is not a process, not an effort, just shifting the attention away from the world simply by looking at myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eyesight is not like a camera, it is like a mirror. &lt;strong&gt;Eyesight is not attached. As I close the eyes, does the eyesight miss any of those countless forms? If you carefully examine, the answer is “no”. I’m fine. The absence of forms does not make me deficient in any way.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a revelation that I’m not attached to any form what so ever.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do you love ice cream/money/nice home? Because you love yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was never sorrowful in my life and I will never become sorrowful in future also. I’m the very ground of supreme (para) love (prema).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Real sorrow should have crashed you by now, you would have not arrived at where you’re are now. You only imagined that you’re sorrowful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop dividing.&lt;/strong&gt; No suppression, no driving away thus no separation (of me from the anger), no escape from the anger. No conflict. You’re aware of the anger. Once you’re aware of the anger it will go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See the trick of the mind: &lt;strong&gt;the movement called “me” is the same as “anger”.&lt;/strong&gt; Mind creates a conflict between me and anger and wants to escape it, unless you recognize it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re angry/sorrowful there is a very pronounced “me” there. And that “me” makes the sorrow appear magnified.&lt;/strong&gt; When you don’t divide and thus there is no attempt to escape the sorrow by 1) making more money 2) pursuing pleasures 3) religion - rituals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not my sorrow. It is the “me” that is sorrowful and it is the sorrow which creates the “me”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sorrow is a guest. It comes, stays for a while and goes away. Joy is intrinsic.&lt;/strong&gt; A sorrowful  person goes to sleep - he’s happy. A happy person goes to sleep - he’s happy. &lt;strong&gt;Whatever comes, will go. Whatever is, is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical pain might be inevitable but sorrow is optional.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-identification with the limited (physical object) is the real cause of the suffering. There is sofa. Not “my sofa”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To what are you attached? Consciousness? Nothing happened to it. Life? Panca bhutas? Nothing happened to them either. You can be attached only to form.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind is addicted to thinking wrongly: “I’m this and I’m that.” Thus it constantly fears the loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Root of psychological suffering is the ignorance of the self. People do not know the self and they do not know that they do not know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you’re looking with total attention, there is no division.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you use the word experience, it is not conceptual knowledge. It is more direct perception. That’s why we say “spiritual experience”. But “experience” in the context of realization of the truth is not like experiencing a sunset with the eyes … There is no duality in this particular “experience”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vrtti - modification of the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1paVisEsyDw&quot;&gt;Class 20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ego, the person, is not the real self. It is the historic self. Every person is a walking biography.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tvam is not the ego, it is the real self. The real meaning of aham.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you have a sense of me only when you are frustrated, angry, unhappy … It is possible to be aware of things without being the ego.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bodhaha (boda) - awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sakshi is a very provisional status. It is sakshi not intrinsically, only in reference to sakshyam. That is the meaning of tvam.
 A way to solve problems - deny the very problem itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do you call mind “my mind”? &lt;strong&gt;It never ever obliged me. Why should I call it “my mind”? Don’t believe your mind. Step back from it - be a witness to the mind. If the mind is sorrowful, be a witness to the sorrow. Don’t be the ego, which is the sorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the pain. Keep the external external. I’m not the pain, don’t internalize.&lt;/strong&gt; BG: sparshAn krvtvA bahir bAhyAn. Same for sorrow of the mind, or any other emotion of it. &lt;strong&gt;That sorrow is the other. I’m the higher dimension of pure light of awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no action involved on the part of the light. Illumination is not an action. &lt;strong&gt;Knowing is not action. Knowledge is separate category, it doesn’t commander the category of action. Watching is not doing, it is not a job, action. It is illuminating.&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re aware of the mind you’re termed the witness of the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thoughts float through the mind like sounds float through the air. And you’re aware of the thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Witnessing of whatever happens (is present in the mind) is most simple, spontaneous. It is not a new thing you have to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Witness is the great unborn - ajah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for the witness is missing the point all together.&lt;/strong&gt; You be the witness. &lt;strong&gt;No sadhana is the best sadhana.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Situations around constantly change the qualities of the mind - vikara. Of these is the witness completely free from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World, body, sense-organs, mind, intellect, ego - unreal. Witness - real/unreal. Awareness absolute - real. Witness is the window to the truth.&lt;/strong&gt; In witnessing the awareness is aware of the mind. Whereas in absolute awareness the awareness is not even aware of itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sharana - refuge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t contradict yourself. If you want health, deserve health. If you want peace, deserve peace.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are no things independent of knowledge. The pot cannot have an existence separate of knowledge. There are no actions separate from knowledge. &lt;strong&gt;On the movie screen, can you have some part not enveloped by the projector?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not the things, not the actions. It is the experience of the things. It is the experience of actions.&lt;/strong&gt; Some experience we label as pleasure and pursue them, and some as pain and we avoid them. Thus we’re caught in the net of experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Witnessing is stepping back from an experience and externalising it. Not only with unpleasant but also pleasant ones.&lt;/strong&gt; You remain avikari - unmodified.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somebody says nice things, I do feel good, but I step back. Somebody else says some silly things, I might feel a little disturbed, but I step back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food should be proper. Meditation is the way. Witnessing is the way and goal. &lt;strong&gt;You need to have a light body and mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; Should be laghu, not guru.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsX8ibhsrzo&quot;&gt;Class 21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fact that you are aware of something eliminates the possibility that you’re it at the same time. Eyes cannot see themselves. Hand cannot touch itself. Mind does not know itself. It is the higher dimension that illuminates it and is aware of the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a-kasha, pra-kasha. Kasha is the awareness which illuminates both. It is also called Kashi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between body and the pure light of awareness is the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reflection has its own characteristics. Sun appears small in a waterdrop. Chitabhasa = “I’m” in the mind. It can identify with either the body or the source.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of the reflection is based upon the perfection of the mind.&lt;/strong&gt; Because of the crudity of the mind and ID with the body you become a person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind lacks discrimination because of tamo- and rajoguna. Sattva stands for the purity of the mind. Correct knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge is everything. Knowledge is very powerful. Remove rajo und tamoguna and he mind is pure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desire (rajas) or fear (tamas). Don’t give it the strength of ID (saying “my desire”). Creating a division, leading to conflict. Just be aware of it (“there is a desire” - no conflict).&lt;/strong&gt; It won’t be strong or powerful. It will just be there. And slowly it will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A little of rajas and tamas won’t hurt you. A bit of them is needed. To do stuff, you need rajas. To sleep, to eat food, you need tamas. But they won’t dominate you. &lt;strong&gt;You know yourself as the spirit.&lt;/strong&gt; That is the moksha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jaska in nirruktam defines 6 stages (shat bhava vikara) of material objects: jayate, asti (duration), viparinamate (change), vardhate (grows), apakshiyate (decline), nashyati (vanish).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t expect the market people, religion to enlighten you. They won’t help you to disidentify with the body. It is the lot of philosopher. Like a guy who always brings bad news. That’s why most of the preacher and gurus gave up philosophy and ventured into religion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Philosopher: the earlier death comes the better. You know troubles associated with long life. &lt;strong&gt;Not longevity but senility.&lt;/strong&gt; Sanat kumara was happy with being turned into camel so he would not have to cook the food.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No wonder there is conflict everywhere. We go on living having forgotten who our true self.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the life of shadow self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pratibhasika = appearance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the thoughts resolve into I’m. I’m-ness also resolves to pure awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m-ness is the window to the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no difference between I’m-ness and pure light of awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9kQ_CVndc4&quot;&gt;Class 22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human nature: first take care of the world. -&amp;gt; Religious nature: first ask what is god? -&amp;gt; Philosophy: first and foremost know yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before going into the world, which is not a very friendly place, you’d know yourself. &lt;strong&gt;You can be happy and secure in the world, living and interacting in the world, provided you know yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You cannot know God, unless you know yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before going into the world, you’d know yourself, or else it will bind you&lt;/strong&gt;, even in most favourable circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your god is based on your estimate on yourself. First understand yourself, not god. Understanding oneself - tvampadartha zodhanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theocentric vs. homocentric religion.&lt;/strong&gt; Which do you want to follow? Religion of puranas is theocentric. Religion of karmakhanda is theocentric. Religion of the upanishads is homocentric. Religion of Buddha is homocentric. That’s why there was a conflict (karmakhanda).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swami: sometimes I ask why old and new testament are printed together. New testament is a revolution over old testament. Until Vatican converted it again into theocentric. Same in vedas, karma khanda and upanishads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When there is a contect between tvam and tat, true religion is centered around tvam. Homocentric. That is Vedanta.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a patriarchal society, this young man starts the relationship with his wife with a sense of superiority and domination. The lady is willing to submit and that’s how the entire society survives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love doesn’t recognise higher and lower. Is beyond divisions. Start relationship with love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even in the human relationship you estimate of yourself is the critical element. What to speak of religion. Your understanding of god will depend upon depending your understanding of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tat, which is the infinite, is embedded in tvam. How to realize that? Remove boundaries of tat and tvam itself emerges as tat.&lt;/strong&gt; tat estimated wrongly is separate from tvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Realizing god can be done only in one way, realizing one’s own divinity. That’s why &lt;strong&gt;tvam takes priority.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Negative understanding is the highest understanding. When you negate the four elements, what is left is the space. All positive understanding understanding comes under the category of ajnana. &lt;strong&gt;The right way to arrive at the truth is to see the false as false, which is not easy. Gradually a stage comes when all the negative understanding is in place and then you come to direct appreciation, direct perception in which the real, the tat, is understood in positive terms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a sin to call yourself a sinner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose you take yourself wrongly as a person than your god will be also a person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the outer (false) self calls itself for a person then it is separate from all the other persons. The outer self is always seeking advantage, anxious, afraid. Sometimes cheerful, sometimes bold. Lustful, doesn’t know what is love. Sick and healthy. Old and young.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to negate the outer self all the way. The real self is unchanging - kutastah. There is only one which is the self of all, incl. animals, vegetables and mineral kingdom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The spirit of true religion is essentially a change of heart&lt;/strong&gt;. Replacing the egoism with divinity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special spell, which makes is free, not bound. Love. You’re unbound.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;True love, which has no opposite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show the path of love which stops the winds of the hatred to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go_t6XFFLoE&quot;&gt;Class 23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;realized = Real-ized. ized = to make, to actualize. You have to understand tvam, not just gain some knowledge of tvam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need a humble heart to admit and acknowledge the gap between knowledge and realization. Then realization is not far away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I acquire knowledge I have to make it real. Not come with an external reason for the gap like “I need the grace of Ishvara” or “the mind is impure”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic difference between true and popular religion. In popular you need not realize anything. Believing and following is enough. That is the ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion is realization.&lt;/strong&gt; That discontent, that I have not yet realized, one should have.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hear, understand and realize.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the way it has to go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoga is what unites tvam with tat.&lt;/strong&gt; In yoga there are no failures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Idea is never the truth. Few things are not: word, idea, symbol (murti). Then knowledge is not realization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman means the vastness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge is always of the limited, of things. Knowledge of the brahman is a contradiction.&lt;/strong&gt; Table limits the book and the book limits the table - one cannot occupy the same space at the same time as the other. No object of the universe can limit brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman is the substratum of every object. What you call the table is brahman with a certain limitation. Brahman with nama rupa added is the table.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be able to negate nama rupa only then you’ll be able to go to the underlying reality. Suppose you negate all nama rupa. Now the consciousness is free from all the nama rupas and you brahman is already with you. No need to invite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the mind becomes silent, there is the quality of spaciousness in that silence.&lt;/strong&gt; Where there is nama rupa, distraction, there is no silence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is time in consciousness or consciousness is in time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being able to contemplate upon something means being able to understand and realize.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The world itself is the unknown and unknowable. There are a trillion galaxies with millions of stars in them. A table is 99.99% space. And 0.001% of matter. And that matter is atoms made of particles. What are the particles? Nobody knows. Now &lt;strong&gt;you cannot ask the question “how is it created?” What is there to be created? You can only ask the question “how come it appears this way?”&lt;/strong&gt; How come I experience is as this? What is the basis for this experience?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Aristotelean materialism the consciousness is byproduct of matter. Whereas in Sankhya system the consciousness is an independent entity. Vedanta: brahman is substantive (means that alone is real) and constituent material cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matter is something illuminated by the consciousness, not independent of consciousness.&lt;/strong&gt; Which is subservient? &lt;strong&gt;Both are one and the same and that is the brahman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-24&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdhWuueBkPs&quot;&gt;Class 24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tat - something that is unknown and unknowable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vidita - known. Both vidita and avidita are in our experience. &lt;strong&gt;What you call unknown is also within your experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are always anxious to reach out beyond “this” (world) to reach out for that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your consciousness has the history of entire humankind. Brain is the product of millions of years of evolution. Your DNA has the history of the entire mankind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is already in our experience. We’re saturated with it, we’re unhappy with it. It constantly creates problems and that’s why we’re constantly trying to reach out, not reach in, for that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is security in the known. Keep your (false) security! But you’ll be bound. Come out out of the security created by words, concepts, ideas. There must be a discontent, revolt in you. To reach out for t(h)at. In t(h)at human consciousness there is this vijnasa. Because this is unsatisfactory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once the discontent is gone you’re unfit to know the truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tat - paramatma, tvam - the historic self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jagat is myself and what I experience. tat is its the origin, the cause of the subject-object duo. Subject is I’m, object is there is. The origin is neither subjective (mind) nor objective (matter)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Vedanta you don’t have definitions. You only have pointers. Because the real is beyond known and unknown, beyond the senses and the mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gravitation is the origin of matter. Matter is space. Mind is always past, future - movement - therefore time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tat is all.&lt;/strong&gt; Substantive and constituent cause. Not the Aristotelean material cause. &lt;strong&gt;And yet it is nothing. Gold is all ornaments. But it is not an ornament.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the totality and the exclusion. It is the immanent and yet transcendent. &lt;strong&gt;It is the fullness and also it is emptiness.&lt;/strong&gt; Look at space - it is both.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The day you started to fill your braincells with definitions that day your study has divorced from realization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot describe it but you can lose yourself in it.&lt;/strong&gt; Like space. When mind becomes silent it becomes spacious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve to deny reality to both subject and object.&lt;/strong&gt; To all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Philosophy: object is real = realism. Subject is real = idealism. Advaita Vedanta is beyond both. Generally you start with realism, come to idealism, rise above it also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World is the same as world experience. World experience is the product of senses (provide the nama) and the mind (provides the rupa). Deny reality to the world experience. Now you come to the subject (historic self). Deny reality to it also. Then you come to t(h)at which cannot be denied. That is brahman, that is paramatma.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body is the scaffold, for both mind and senses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even a very well trained mind cannot conceptualize it. It is beyond. Even the attempt to know the mind by the mind is a contradiction. Mind moves from known to the known.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do you think you need the mind to know? &lt;strong&gt;The silly jada senses, mind know with the light of atma. Atman cannot know all by itself? Why do you think you need the mind to know?&lt;/strong&gt; Leave the mind behind. &lt;strong&gt;You know atma by its own light&lt;/strong&gt;. Now the means of knowing is its very light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m the guest. What you sense first? Guest-ness or being? Being. I’m is the sensing of the being. There is a pot. What is first? The sense of being. What is the division between the sense of being “I’m” and “there is”, subject and object?&lt;/strong&gt; identification, &lt;strong&gt;ajnana is the boundary&lt;/strong&gt; . Body and mind are objects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being is its own pointer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the upasanas dvaitam is provisionally accepted. If you’re dealing with saguna brahma you can use the word “manifest”. Talking about nirguna brahma you have to use the word appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The being is what you’re sensing. &lt;strong&gt;Always you’re sensing the being. But you think that nama rupa you’re sensing. Example: what are you sensing, cup or clay? Don’t relay upon eyes all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you say subject it is the being what you sense. When you say object it is the being what you sense. The being is still limited. Take care to dismiss nama rupa. When nama rupa has to be attached, why do you call it being? That object, whether the subject sense of beidg or object sense of being is the pointer to the real.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A pointer is not limited in space time. satta is the pointer. Everywhere you’re sensing satta (not roads, buildings, pots). In sensing that being becomes a pointer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you call “all” is reduced to here/there, now/then, this/that … pairs of opposites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re not hurt by anything. If something says against us/Rama … we bless him. Philosophical mind never gets hurt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re like a frog in the well. There is so much wisdom out in the world. &lt;strong&gt;On the part of Rshis/Upanishads there is a tremendous effort not to objectify brahman. By doing that you’re making brahman jada. You convert it to tamoguna.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sat is the being. Satyaha is the truth. Shankara: yat sat tat satyam - what is is the truth. &lt;strong&gt;What is called being that alone is the truth. The being of the subject is the truth. But the subject itself is not truth. The being of the object is the truth. But the object itself is not truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-25&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCyAwA0VqGM&quot;&gt;Class 25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you miss it, it becomes shunya. When you catch it, it becomes purna.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pot is unreal (abhava). Idealists (vijnanavadis) stop there, for them that is the truth. That is zunyavada.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taste of your mouth exists, you experience it, but you can’t say whether it is sweet, pungent … It is pointed by the abhava by all six tastes. It is what remains after all these tastes are negated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrogance of scholarships (I know … and teach …) puts the person entirely on the wrong track. Negation gives you humility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When there are distinctions, there are reactions. When there are no distinction, here is only action. What remains is very simple and you cannot describe it. It is very solid, like a diamond. You cannot describe it, it is real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When mind is active, you’re stuck with distinctions. There is only rationalizations. Too much of rationalization doesn’t leave you anywhere. When the mind is silent, there is only wonder (bhakti).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind is habituated to distinctions and reactions. And reaction of the mind is expressed in speech and movement. Robot.&lt;/strong&gt; This is what we do in temples. That mechanicalness kills the creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When there is no reaction in your heart, shesha remains. Isvhara is called sheshsa. Bhagavatam: shishyate iti shesha samjgnaha. That snake thing is the agrarian mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunyavadi: &lt;code class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;less&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; remains. Not all-together different from advaita’s purnatvam. That’s why they say purnata (&lt;code class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;. Buddha is the student of upanishads. He was not a ritualist. His purnata does not contradict what he’s learned - the upanishads. Buddha is atmavadi, not sunyavadi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman is the unconditioned. How can you describe the unconditioned?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Krishna: Akarshati papat. Is a positive hint to connect with the real.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Vedanta we’re not very keen on positive terms. Positive terms are only hints, understood properly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happiness is happening when you’re not seeking happiness. When you’re seeking it the “me” is seeking it and therefore there cannot be any happiness. Any desire puts the sense of me, that’s how it is created.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there “me” that is attachment, not love.&lt;/strong&gt; Love is caitanyam. That &lt;strong&gt;sentient being (table cannot have love)&lt;/strong&gt; is brahman is manifesting as love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ananda with oneself, prema with relating to everybody else. In fact they’re not different.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brahman is neither saguna, nor nirguna. It is what it is. Ajatah vada.&lt;/strong&gt; Saguna -&amp;gt; nirguna -&amp;gt; ajatah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is only one brahma. Wrong question cannot be answered, only shown as wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-26&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JracFNZ8IPY&quot;&gt;Class 26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wind is one. But it goes around the entire universe and acquires all kinds of shapes. Breeze, hurricane… &lt;strong&gt;The inherent power to become many must be there in Vayu. Same for fire. Same for brahman. That is the shakti of saguna brahman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When explaining the jagat, then you have to resort to saguna brahman. For saguna teachers, words like nishkriya, nirguna sound bad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ajnana of cit, caytanyam makes you believe, that the two forms of cit, jiva and isvara are real. How do you know the ajnana of cit? By cit only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When somebody questions the belief it results in animosity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vishnu is rich peoples’ god. Shiva is poor peoples’ god.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you have leader, you stop thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Leader is context of knowledge is one who thinks on your behalf. Once you stop thinking you go into a belief system easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: a person who has seen the ocean describes it to somebody who has never seen it. Similarly the acarya describing the tat to a worldly person as sarvajnah, sarvashaktih…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peoples’ self definition is usually based on the account of their actions performed, usually work. I’m a doctor, teacher etc. Define yourself based on your power of knowing. Everybody has it, only few pay attention to it. I’m a philosopher, mathematician, researcher…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No matter how much you know the sphere of knowing is always smaller then the sphere of ignorance. When you declare what you know you also declare what you don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you know the real it doesn’t matter how much unreal you know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you call ice, steam, water is water only. There is not water as such. It is sat alone appearing as water. Everything is sat only. That sat is brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-27&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDeUo_ck01E&quot;&gt;Class 27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman is not something else. It is not only transcendental, but it is immanent - substantive and constitutive cause of everything in the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman was there before creation. Brahman has become all. Sarvabhavana. Substantive and constitutive cause. Adhisthana of entire universe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Idealism: there are objects and conciousness. Brahman is that which is beyond both. It alone becomes the conciousness as well its objects. Yet it is beyond both.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind and matter are the states of the same reality. That reality is stateless. If it is a state, you can describe it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman is utter stillness, quietness. Movement is maya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;svayamprakasha - it doesn’t require any other pramana than itself. That’s why it is called aprameyaha. It is not and it need not to be available for other pramana. &lt;strong&gt;You know yourself as the awareness absolute just by being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t think you know just by pratyaksha, anumana or shabda (book) etc. Final is knowing by being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ignorant silence: hathayogi. Atmayogi’s silence is like a computer with all information going to sleep. That silence is full of vision, inner understanding. There is a name for it: Intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To know brahman, you do not need the mind. In fact, it becomes an obstacle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind only knows attachment, if disturbed it becomes aversion. Mind doesn’t know love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All divisions are in citta, the mind. None in cit, the brahman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What all you say about god is not coming from god. It is coming from you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puja Swamiji: God has made man in his image -&amp;gt; once the man makes the god in his image. That god makes the man in his image. Therefore you’re the god you’re worshiping. When you’re describing tvam it emerges as tat. When you’re describing tat it emerges as tvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There cannot be a god without a devotee. God is the blossoming of devotion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematician talks of the infinite of something that is known. Vedantin’s infinite is not known.&lt;/strong&gt; That which mind cannot reach. You can reach it by being the infinite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You know brahman by looking at the prapanca, understanding the prapanca and then negating the prapanca. There is no other way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You cannot negate something which you don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brgu went to Varuna, his father. Varuna did not even teach. He said you find out the god. Why teach? It cannot be taught. It has to be discovered in your heart as the inner-most self. Varuna did teach how to discover.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ready made brahman: one mantra, one tatra, one yantra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-28&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfgzZu1xhEI&quot;&gt;Class 28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christianity, their theology, is nowadays all about miracles. You are made a saint if you perform miracles. This is not vedanta. This is devanta. Vedanta is that which encourages you to know that which is worth knowing if you want freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pravesha - entry, entering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brahman created this universe - brahmAnda. The moment brahman enters into the cosmic body is not anymore brahman. It becomes cosmic person - hiranyagrabha. Brahman is the same as hiranyagrabha. Hiranyagarbha has another name - prathama jivaha. We’re all the offspring of it. What is called Hiranyagarbha in upanishads is called Brahmadeva in puranas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vishnu is also Hiranyagarbha, Shiva also. What is Hiranyagarbha that you’re. In your case brahman entered this single body. Entered as jiva (individual soul).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shining is knowing.&lt;/strong&gt; That inner shining. Eyes know, nose knows, ears know. Mind and thoughts. You’re aware of everything. That is the brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“me” is also a thought. Just like any other thought. Somebody is dancing or studying or watching movie … it is all thought. You’ve got a desire/fear it is a thought.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the eyes, see the ears. It is obvious that brahman has entered as jiva.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What entered and what is there cannot be two different things.&lt;/strong&gt; The family person entering the bus and the passenger now are not two different persons. Two are there - that is dvaita. Dvaita people have converted all pravesha shruti into dead letter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The inner light of this body-mind is the brahman.&lt;/strong&gt; If brahman has entered how can be jiva other than brahman? This is the spirit of pravesha zruti. There is no physical entering, it is a metaphor to establish oneness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sruti - in Veda you only hear. Read is book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I belong to the limit body/mind or do I belong to the infinite life within, the inner light, brahman?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose I’m cut off from the Vayu of the universe and stay with my limited breath. How long will I live? I’m with svasa or am I with infinite Vayu? This is called Pranoupasana.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your heart is the meeting place of brahman and the body/mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Die to the mind: die to the memories of the past. Die to the imaginations of the future. Die to your attachments, aversions, frustrations, anger, greed… Die to your ownership and possessions.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the crucification of the Christ. The jiva identified with the body/mind has to die to the body/mind. Not tomorrow, but now. That is yoga. That is the spirit of pravesha shruti. That is the learning of Vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-29---youre-dutiful-not-responsible-for-karma-phala-relax&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP_YAPoHBP8&quot;&gt;Class 29&lt;/a&gt; - you’re dutiful, not responsible for karma phala, relax&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you think you know about Shiva, is not knowledge. It is ideation. Without knowing, mind forms ideas. &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge in the form of ideation is not going to help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In true religion ideas alone have no value. In true religion you should know deep within, you should realize God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karma is the most important in life. Life is karma. What is awareness? Awareness is knowledge. That is the difference between the two. Human existence is karma + jnanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Field of karma gives you that wonderful opportunity to get an intimation of that real. Intimation is enough, you need not realize the whole truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;samsari - samyak sarati. Always active. He planes his action based on the results he seeks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The question comes, who will give the result? You need not perform karma if you could give yourself the result. God will bless me. If god will bless me, why should I do karma at all? Mimamsakas: it is the karma that will bless us. That will work, if karma is the sole cause of the result. But then performing karma correctly should always give the desired result, which is not the case. Or sometimes somebody without karma is getting karmaphala. There must be a thing higher than karma to give the karma phala.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A thing is the way it is only because the universe is the way it is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes are countless&lt;/strong&gt;. Effort doesn’t determine the outcome. There is a higher power which does.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the power of life in you. If you don’t put in effort and just sit in a corner, you’ll become a sick person. &lt;strong&gt;You’ve to put in the effort. But you’ve to understand (avadharaya) that the result is not determined by this effort alone.&lt;/strong&gt; The result is determined by the universal reality - God/brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First step: &lt;strong&gt;hands to the work, heart to the god.&lt;/strong&gt; This is karma yoga. This is how mahatmas live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karma doesn’t give phalam. It would amount to you giving the phalam to yourself. That is the ahamkara.&lt;/strong&gt; Somebody claims he’s a self-made person? Ahamkara. He’s God made person. &lt;strong&gt;To reach where you’re God had to bless you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surgeon’s effort doesn’t heal you. It is the higher power manifesting in the body that heals you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea that I’m responsible for the outcome weights heavily on the people. You’re responsible for the karma! Do karma and relax.&lt;/strong&gt; Do the most sincere effort. Some people might like it or not, but leave the rest to the higher power and relax. &lt;strong&gt;Learn to relax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After karma you’ll be physiologically tired. If you think you’re responsible for the outcome, you’ll be tired psychologically as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine madness: putting in all the effort and not worrying about the outcome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your self to the karma, never ever to the karma phala. In fact, give up karma phala. There is peace immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is karma. But &lt;strong&gt;am I the doer? When there is speaking, speech is happening. Power of life and power of knowledge are responsible for the speech.&lt;/strong&gt; Power of life is given, I’m not the author of it. Nor the parents.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Language, knowledge are not personal, but universal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of life, power of knowledge come from the higher power. I’m the conduit for the speech to happen. Is fan going round and round? Or is it made to go round and round?&lt;/strong&gt; Hetu karta (electricity for fan) is the God. And you see it behind everything happening. Do you cook the food or is the food cooked through you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Become free from the huge burden of responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BG 2.47: karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana - you’ve every right to work but not expecting fruits of it. Do not focus on the fruits and never be inactive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This upadhi, this conduit is now surrendered to Isvhara. Let ishvara treat it the way he likes. How long he wants to use it? Let him decide. I’m not responsible, I’m not doer. Now the divine madness is complete.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-30&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuKd9ufX2xc&quot;&gt;Class 30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can connect the life (of action) to that tat it leads to realization. OTOH if you look at tat from the standpoint of the intellect alone, there is some value in that also, but it is more likely to become intellectual exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; And you’re likely to remain stuck there. It can make a good teacher out of you, but not a realized person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day you are going through the cycle of sukha and dukha. That is the karma phala. If you can connect it to brahman it is not conceptual brahman anymore, it is living brahman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;samatvam is equality. tadatyam is not! It is identity. E.g. 8-2 = 2x3, but 8-2 not ID 2x3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;samsarga - undifferentiated association. Pot is blue. That is not ID, but association. Nila is different, ghata is different, but they are stuck together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vishistatvam - togetherness. dAm AnayA.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;akhanda - they appear different but on close examination they are identical.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you carefully examine, you’re &lt;strong&gt;sarvajnah. Everything is in your knowledge. Some things are known to you - vidita. The others are avidita. But they are also known to you! Suppose something is not known to you, can you put to avidita/vidita?&lt;/strong&gt; You: not even God cannot be knowing all the things all the time. Believer: but he has the potential to know. That cit and this cat have the same potential. Division is put there out of habit, lack of proper understanding one self and conditioning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You contradict yourself all the time, so much habituated that you don’t mind it. &lt;strong&gt;As long as you’re a person and the devotee of a personal god, tat tvam asi is not for you.&lt;/strong&gt; Dead letter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vivekananda: examine the god you worship. It is the projection/blossoming of your own inner spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As long as you live in contradictions, you will not realize the truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aupanishadah and nAstika look alike.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brain, the conditioning, has become a cover for the heart, the endless love you’re. &lt;strong&gt;What you call God is in you, only covered.&lt;/strong&gt; Learn to look for God within.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You go out of sleep, first you are aware (of nothing in particular yet), then aham comes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-31&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN-lScPRH_8&quot;&gt;Class 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My prayer is very simple and short, because I value your time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pratyak bodhah - innermost awareness (not knowledge). Primordial awareness (e.g. gold for ornaments). In which there are no parts (advaya), and no change. &lt;strong&gt;Bodha - you cannot know it, you can be it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose you abide in your self and the mind is silent. You’ll not experience any second. No sense of division.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ananda - pure awareness, all shanti - quiet. Sukha - pleasure (agitation, restlessness).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is only one way of realising God - as the inner most self. Dismiss all other silly stories. Explain them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want brahmajnanam? Really? The one who gets brahmajnanam will not be there by the time he gets it. If you’re not prepared for that go home and do some work. Don’t waste our time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ve to want to become a nobody, wholeheartedly. You must want to lose your self. Telugu proverb: I want to be like a goat in a sheep herd. Do you want to be the selfie or the self?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pratyak bodhah - &lt;strong&gt;pure observation without any center.&lt;/strong&gt; You observe and become happy/unhappy - that is the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice your consciousness and note where there is sense of division or fragmentary thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose you’ve sense of caste identity, doership, jealousy, frustration, anger … All are based on sense of division and prevent realisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only when your life is inspired by love and guided by knowledge you’ll have it. First book and then silence. Love without knowledge becomes sentimentality and will destroy you. Knowledge without love makes you a very cruel person, technocrat, monster.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need food for the tummy and food for the intellect. Is that your purpose of studying vaakya vrtti? Should not be. The purpose should be to get rid of the abrahmatvam of the tvam. Do you feel yourself as brahman? Like in sleep, do you feel any want? Any fear? You’ve to reproduce it in the waking state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why don’t you know that I is the brahman? Because you don’t want to know it. It is divine madness and you would be God. You want to retain your smallness, your abrahmatvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcome the habit of abrahmatvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go and eat banana, don’t desire it.&lt;/strong&gt; Or it will establish you in abrahmatvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A child doesn’t need a god outside. Why do you need a god outside?&lt;/strong&gt; You feel yourself so small, petty, poor. That’s why you need a brahman outside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine your life how superficial it is. Centered around the body and its needs, comforts, welfare. The mind and its frustration, envy, gratification, attachments, aversions etc. You miss the real depth of tvam padartha all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3SLqhWUeC0&quot;&gt;Class 32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paroksha - farawayness (parah+akSa - eyesight). Terrible conditioning coming from puranic literature. Erase it. &lt;strong&gt;God is pratyaksha {prati+akSa}.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swami: I’m not a temple guy. Not a pauranikah. I’m aupanishadah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When mother is alive, you don’t need another god. When mother is no more, acharya is. When acarya is no more, entire humanity is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love your neighbour - love entire humanity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no friend, there is no foe. There is only divinity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love of what is not important. Love of all, everything.&lt;/strong&gt; That is god consciousness. Boundary between good and evil is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose God is not parokSa anymore. Tvam is not abrahma anymore. Then what? Tvam becomes one with the God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;srunu - listen!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outside there is no fullness. Fullness is in you in the form of unbounded spacious awareness. Find it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To experience any want, you have to come down to the level of the mind.&lt;/strong&gt; All want is in the mind. Once you discover it, even when the mind is there it won’t disturb the fullness, you, God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You do everything for happiness. As long as you seek it, you’ll be away from it. If somebody offers happiness, say “thanks no”. &lt;strong&gt;Reach a point of consciousness in which you do not seek.&lt;/strong&gt; Then you’ll discover you’re the bliss. As long as you seek you’re a small guy, abrahman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_xGnk12OI&quot;&gt;Class 33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unmatta pralAbhaha - blabbering of a crazy guy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;karmakanda is all vacyarta. In Vedanta it is dismissed right away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you can define brahman, it becomes unpure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to the matters of inner reality, all conclusions are wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; Same for tvam and tat. Keep it open. Lakshiarta - open-ended meaning. Vacyarta - conclusive meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop highlighting the body. Go on negating the ID with the body. I’m beyond all this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In tvam pada all the physical things have to be dropped. Then mental things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You arrive at lakshiarta by negation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accommodate it. The symbol is not the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever you perceive that is not God. And that is not you also. You’re what makes perception possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The tvam and the tat they merge. Tvam doesn’t remain tvam anymore, tat doesn’t remain tat anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People have problems. The fact that they are still doing religious rituals prove the problems are not solved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritualization -&amp;gt; losing the sensitivity. Mechanization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All is god, everything is god. And you see yourself as totally different from body/mind and physical things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pravartate - moving forward&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To make a religion you need a separate tat and separate tvam. Otherwise where is the religion? Therefore take tat and add impurities (shabala).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLrJqUdkhXg&quot;&gt;Class 34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara makes a difference between shabda (word), pratyaya (idea) and vastu (thing outside). Apply to tvam (aham). You have to reach beyond the word and its meaning. Just the word and its idea have no meaning without he vastu. The basis is the sense of myself, being, I’m-ness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind is the function, work of the braincells. An object throws light upon the eyes and optical sensation happens. That sensation is interpreted by the mind as the thought. The interpretation is called cognition. Cognition is indifferent. When it is made into experience it becomes more important and gets imprinted in the mind.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise mind will be deleting the cognitions. Estimated 99 out of 100 are deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind records and keeps it so you can pull it out later. &lt;strong&gt;Another name for this memory is mind.&lt;/strong&gt; What you call mind is but thought, past recordings. And all thought originates in memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feeling of the sense of being, I’m-ness, is possible only when the atman reflects in the body/mind. In the absence of this reflection atman doesn’t feel itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To know tvam, which translates as aham, do you look into the book? To the speaker? Or do you look within?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind projects boredom, because it wants a variety of things. You have to teach the mind to keep quiet.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to understand. Who’s your best friend? Atma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feeling is deeper than thinking. Feeling is in the heart, thinking in the head. Be a heart person (all love), not head person (all logic). &lt;strong&gt;Prefer love to logic.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose the other insults you. Love demands try to bless the person. Logic demands revenge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose it is the mind looking at the mind. That is known to whom?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aham - pure awareness in which there is no knowing. Mind knows the object - there is knowing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you go to the jeweler’s shop you don’t see many things. There is only one thing. Eyes + mind together see many ornaments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character of mirror: show things that don’t exist.&lt;/strong&gt; Break it and you’ll see. &lt;strong&gt;Mirror doesn’t reflect no things. It only reflects light.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without mirror, a lense there is no movie. Your eyes are also lenses. You see things that are not there while missing what is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NZZqun_hf0&quot;&gt;Class 35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tat pada comes with a blemish (shabala) - paroksha. What is aparoksha is taken as paroksha and indicated as tat. &lt;strong&gt;The impurity comes always from the upadhi.&lt;/strong&gt; Upadhi of brahman, is maya. Material cause. Jagat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you’re calling material cause is the same as substantive and constituent cause. Chaitanyam. What you call matter is chaitanyam alone, which appears as matter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the jagat side, the substantive cause. From its own side, from karana side it’s constituent cause (karya-karana bhava). Both is brahman. Both are the same as the very lose expression - the material cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;jonih - cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maya is the upadhi of brahman, without which which there cannot be apparent division between jiva and brahman, the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vadah - theory. You need the theory of maya to explain the world. In case of maya it’s not a theory. It’s a statement of fact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basis of our life is contradiction.&lt;/strong&gt; Are you life or are you death? &lt;strong&gt;We have to move through these tremendous contradictions, the opposites&lt;/strong&gt;. In Rama you’ll find some adharma and in Ravana there is a lot of good too. Death follows life like a shadow follows a person. &lt;strong&gt;Our life moves through these contradictions and maya is the explanation for them.&lt;/strong&gt; Maya is a way of understanding the tremendous contradictions of our lives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need not, cannot understand brahman, your self. All you need to understand is maya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: Maya is whirling of “I love you”. Maya has to move. Brahman is kutastah, changeless, immobile. In the case of jagat the whirling is replaced by the mind. &lt;strong&gt;Mind is not a thing, it is movement. The thing is chaitanyam.&lt;/strong&gt; This elaborate thing of the power of moving associated with ajnana makes you believe that there is a jagat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no difference between ajnana and mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We don’t call it avidya when you put maya as the upadhi to brahman. You worship saguna brahman. You do not identify with saguna brahman. Saguna brhama is different and you are different. Maya as avidya would sound bad for worship purpose. So we say maya or shakti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maya is avidya only.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact there is no difference between jiva and brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parokshatvam - provisional division (dinstinction) created between alpajnah jiva and sarvajnah ishvara. Created for worship, for the purpose of overcoming maya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To begin with it was personification. So poetic and beautiful but then it became literal. So maya is stri-linga. And there are three gunas in maya. Thus three women. If there is a woman, what is the right thing (in India)? Get married. Man may not marry but a women should. Now there are three. When women marry what they do? Fight among themselves. So sarasvati, laksmi, parvati will be most of the time very friendly but occasionally they fight also. Now there are currents worshiping maya only without shiva (saguna brahman).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ve to worship saguna brahman. Maya is included. What is it? The rising sun. Panca bhutas. Need not have a particular shape. The life in every lifeform. Namaste vayo tvam eva pratyaksham brahmasi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brahman is neuter. Maya is the upadhi, not a woman. First you put a woman there and then you say woman should be given priority etc.&lt;/strong&gt; Saguna brahma upasana only should be done. &lt;strong&gt;Once you lose the track and dismiss saguna brahman and hold on to the maya shakti now the ground is ready for an enormous degeneration.&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. vamacara. An enormous degeneration happened in the Hindu dharma. And that division went on and on and on. Women were suppressed and not given proper status, then caste divisions, caste among gods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some muni: &lt;em&gt;I would like to see the entire Hindu society chanting gayatri manta and worshipping saguna brahman in the rising sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: “I love you” is not what is there. “I love you” is what you see! How come? Maya. Translation Maya = illusory, delusion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose glow (cit of brahman) is not present at something, then it doesn’t even appear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maya you cannot entirely explained.&lt;/strong&gt; If you could, it would be not maya anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t go to the real of the nama rupa, then your worship loses its purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_0VwMb93Ao&quot;&gt;Class 36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not seek. Why should you seek, when you get things without seeking? Seeking stands in the way as a wall. It perpetuates division, dvaita, duality. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t seek anything from the world, god, body/mind also.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immanent - present in all there is. Transcendent - not bound by the nama rupas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conceptual Vedanta they don’t go beyond words.&lt;/strong&gt; Guru said the words and the words are the truth. Why did he say so? Because his guru said.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pravaha - flow of water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re accustomed to contradictions. We reconcile all contradictions. That’s why we remain where we are. &lt;strong&gt;Primary sadhana is absence of contradictions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contradiction is the worst obstacle for self realization. Suppose you have contradiction it means you’re not very earnest about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many professions. People don’t want self-realization. They want to become vedantins&lt;/strong&gt; - one more profession..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are moments when there is no desire, no fear in your heart. Do you think of god then?&lt;/strong&gt; Because you’re the god. Because desiring and fearing upadhi (jiva) is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5xekcbFkJk&quot;&gt;Class 37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to give up something? You have to do a 180 degrees turn. Slowly decreasing won’t help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It doesn’t matter whether you’re sanyasi or grhasta, &lt;strong&gt;you suffer because of attachment. You have to understand attachment and come out of it.&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot keep some attachment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buddha’s teaching is homocentric. Upanishadic teaching is real-centric. Religions are theocentric. In theocentric (puranas, upasanas) you’re a soul and god is a bigger soul somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primary meaning have no value, are contradictory. Dismiss certain aspects of primary meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sah &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; ayam (this). That devadata from there is not this devadata from here and now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;World is jada. If you’re jada you’re of the world. But you’re not of the world, you’re only in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the land even you cannot move a boat. Water is the place where boat should be. There even a child can move it. But suppose water is put inside the boat. Then the boat will sink. That is how we sink in life. We put the world in ourselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People fail to reach beyond the words. Therefore, when they do and are unable to realize the divinity within they will find other ways. Chant it, do puja, do homa … - convert it into a ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conceptual meaning of life (“the Plan”). That’s the only meaning of life we know. This entire meaning of life collapses in time. All of it. Not one bit remains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You do not wait for the time to end the conceptual framework of life. You end it yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; If you allow the time to end it, it will and your heart will be broken. You’ll plunge into darkness. If you do it yourself, &lt;strong&gt;by knowledge, it is called “bhaga-tyaga lakshanah”&lt;/strong&gt; - I’m not the one who lives. It is the body who lives. Body’s achievements, children, lifespan etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever is conceptual is meaningless.&lt;/strong&gt; 80y lifespan, marriage, children, attachment, aversion, worship of gods and goddesses with sense of duality, time, space … everything that mind can conceive is meaningless. That is bhaga tyaga lakshanah. By doing so you get connected to the reality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever your mind conceives is false and whatever it desires is utterly useless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re just aware of the people. You do not look at them as spouse, friend etc. Same for events. Somebody puts a garland upon you. Somebody else throws mud at you. &lt;strong&gt;You’re just aware.&lt;/strong&gt; Entire conceptual meaning of life is dismantled. The person you imagined yourself to be is gone. And you merge wit the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things happen one way, you’re aware. They happen other way, you’re aware. They do not mean anything anymore, they’re all meaningless. Only the conceptual mind has given them some meaning, which is utterly useless, which will end. Before it ends, I end it myself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tatvabodha is all head-study. Atmabodha is all heart-study, takes you away from concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is better, sravanam or niddidhiasanam? People conveniently forget about mananam. Swami TV: I consider mananam most important. The discussion which of the three is better is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superficially there are three sadhanas but essentially there is one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to make your mind less worldly. You cannot keep the mind very worldly and yet hope to accomplish self-realization. How to make mind less wordly? &lt;strong&gt;Shamah - make mind less worldly, damah - keep the organism alert&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you give some nice food to people they won’t be able to do shravanam. Damah won’t be there. &lt;strong&gt;Excessive food consumption makes the organism very dull.&lt;/strong&gt; Damah is very important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-38&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueGq6QZnhY&quot;&gt;Class 38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All parokshatvam of God is imagination of theologians. Because for them god is a human being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no reason to make the jiva and the deva separate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ajnana provides tremendous security. Because of the insecurity people don’t want to know. In “aham brahma asmi” there is no security. You will not be secure, you’ll be free.&lt;/strong&gt; People prefer to keep the items of the world. Parrot inside the gold cage has security, the wild crane has not. But it entire space belongs to the wild crane, while parrot never knows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human nature: We don’t want this to be over. It has to continue. Just like a hospital is not interested in all people being healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ajnana is convenient. Jnana is most inconvenient of all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You create falsehood all round you. &lt;strong&gt;Falsehood provides security.&lt;/strong&gt; You seek security, so long “aham brahma asmi” keeps at a distance. Sri Ramakrishna: &lt;strong&gt;aham brahma asmi is like you’re holding to a branch of a tree. You stop holding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giving up takes no time, if you really want to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’re giving up is not real. And the real you cannot give up anyway.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re giving up nama rupa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need some quality sravanam, then quality mananam that inspirates and uplifts you. And that niddidhiasanam - be aware of what is going in your mind, of its movement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep god universal, don’t make him South-Indian.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are ready to believe anything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you become a group person, your self-realization is out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re suffering because of ignorance, because your understanding is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When somebody dies I never grieve. For me death is death of the body and the person is merged in Isvhara. What is there to grieve about it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine and make a list of all different elements of bondage which cause suffering. And then dismiss all of them. &lt;strong&gt;(recap) That is what you have to do by understanding the vision with the help of an acarya.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-39&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAexW0Fv0qo&quot;&gt;Class 39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What happened in Hinduism is that we’re left with the acaryas and we lost the shruti. When that happens, the entire religion goes to the wrong direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shruti is the vision.&lt;/strong&gt; Acarya is only presenting the vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do the students give so much importance to the outer “self”? Because the guru does. Sad. The guru should lead dismissing the outer self (shadow). That invisible inner self cannot be seen with the eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one who says god and jiva are different he will not take much time to say you and I are different. And then he’ll say I’m superior and you’re inferior.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The body identified self tries to derive some advantage/glory out of a name.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Root cause of samsara: outer self pursuing a thing or not. Also, check if you’re anxious. That belongs to the outer self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are childish. Just like them they take things very literally. Amrta is not liquid. Amrta is amrtatvam, status of one’s true nature.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are waiting for death. When you create time for yourself (I’m young, old, 30 years old, etc.), you’re waiting for death. If death is today, you don’t wait for it, you face it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who hope for knowledge in future will not get knowledge at all. They will get only death. There is only one thing certain in future - death.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amrta is absence of psychological death. You step of net of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Farmers grows a plant to get crop. Landscaping people are cutting the plants for no reason. Doing a lot of himsa. Same for hunting people. There is only one life-form in the creation that hunts for entertainment. A cow doesn’t destroy grass if it is not hungry (Don Juan - don’t take more then required / greed).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I close the door cautiously, I put the book, use the mask … carefully. The same self is present everywhere. Use it when and how appropriate.&lt;/strong&gt; This is how the one who knows the invisible inner self looks at the world around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People resist. They’re not open. They do not have clarity of thinking. They are conditioned. They’re a bunch of conditioned clowns. Be harsh if necessary, that is the labour of love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;acarya prasAdena - by the love of acarya&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bodhah - understanding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any ending, whatever it is that ends, you’re liberated.&lt;/strong&gt; In the moments of ending there is bliss. Anything, in good and bad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ramanamaharshi: &lt;strong&gt;do you have a mind? That is avidya.&lt;/strong&gt; You do not depend on the mind upon the truth. Your mind can only block the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is freedom from something, e.g. sorrow. And there is a higher version, just freedom - freedom absolute. And both are your own - svarupa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jnana is not visible. Only ajnana is visible.&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you study and examine a person for a long time you can’t tell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only ajnanis are anxious. &lt;strong&gt;Jnani is not anxious. He knows that he’s not the body/mind. The mind will take care of the body by laws of nature.&lt;/strong&gt; Body is thirsty, mind will find water. When there is hunger, food will come. When there is illness, medicine will come. &lt;strong&gt;How? Mind will work out something. Jnani knows this and need not interfere with it.&lt;/strong&gt; The only difference in this context between jnani and ajnani is utter lack of anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All rituals are result of anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=168jhDakHNA&quot;&gt;Class 40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You identify with the organs of action, you become karta. If with the sense organs, you become bhotka. These three (w. mind too) are totally gone for a jnani. “My body” is an idea. Body doesn’t say it. For him, it is “a” body and “a” mind, not “mine”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jnani is not a karta. What needs to be done it gets done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose there is a desire. You’re acutely conscious of the desire, whereas you’re not of so many things of the physiological and psychological functions of the system. Now you want the desire to be fulfilled, for that you do karma, wait for the karma-phala, create psychological time and get bound.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jnani is not afraid of death, he’s not afraid of life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jnani lives a quiet life and quiet death. Quiet is happy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why not death be a simple thing. It should be a simple affair. It should not be an enormous burden on the people left behind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jnanis do not create vasanas in their hearts. Advantage is one is free to love. &lt;strong&gt;You need to be free to love&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a jnani only, there will be agama karma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sancita karma and agami karma are destroyed for the jnani. Even prarabda karma is not there for jnani, it’s there for the body/mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jnani = absence of a self-conscious person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the person is not liberated before death, it will not be liberated after death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vega = momentum. Prarabda karma has a momentum. In life, everything is a moment. It is a flow. It has a velocity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prarabdha will take you forward in the life till that momentum becomes zero and the body falls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kevalasya bhavaha = kaivalyam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are no others for a jnani. All others getting moksha is ridiculous. Double ajnana: I’m ajnani and all others are ajnanis. There are no others. There is no second at any time.&lt;/strong&gt; Who’s left? I’m. Kaivalyam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you see on the screen is in you. Where is she? On the screen or in you? Dance? Music? In you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When everything ends, you’re there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kaivalyam is same as Vishnu. In Vedas there is only all-pervading reality, which is brahman. “Vishnu sahasrama” is “Bhagavan’s sahasranama” and Vishnu is one of the names. Vaishnavas made it into “Vishnu sahasranama”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parama pada - supreme goal, abode.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is something always better. Then the following happens 1) The joy we’re getting melts away when you a better thing 2) the joy that you’ve derived from a given objects stops giving the joy because of the law of diminishing returns 3) it becomes monotonous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monotonous -&amp;gt; no joy. There is only one joy - ananda. Which is you get moksha. You get into sarvaatmabhaava. This jnani gets that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vaishnavam - belonging to Vishnu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satyam is the truth as ascertained by the study of the scriptures. Living, practicing it is called rtam. What you’ve learned from the scriptures you live in life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sharma, varma, gupta, dasa - titles added to the names of brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishays and sudras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-2-mantra-1-1&quot;&gt;Class 2: Mantra 1-1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://greenmesg.org/stotras/vedas/om_vang_me_manasi_pratisthita.php&quot;&gt;Shantipatha&lt;/a&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Om vAn me manasi pratiSThitA&lt;/em&gt; - let my speech be established in my mind&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;mano me vAci pratiSThitam&lt;/em&gt; - let my mind be established in my speech&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AvirAvIrma edhi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;vedasya ma ANIsthah&lt;/em&gt; -reveal truth of Vedas to me&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;zrutam me mA prahAsIh, anenAdhItena ahorAtrAn sandadhAmi&lt;/em&gt; -  may my learning not leave me any time. May my learning be bright and brilliant. I will study day and night (same as: saha vIryam karavavahi)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;rtam vadiSyAmi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;satyam vadiSyAmi&lt;/em&gt; - I speak the truth manifested, I live the truth&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;tanmAmavatu&lt;/em&gt;  - may lord protect me&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;tadvaktAramavatu, avatu mAm avatu vaktAramavatu vaktAram&lt;/em&gt; - may Lord protect my teacher&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;om zAntih, zAntih, zAntih&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3x shanti - to protect from adhiatmika, adhibautika, adhidaivika obstacles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;atma derivations
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apnoti {ap}. Vyapnoti. Pervades everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Is not conditioned by space.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atti {ad}. Eats everything. Enjoyer of all experiences with objects.&lt;/strong&gt; Nature of consciousness, not conditioned by objects.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attate. Not conditioned by time. Has eternal existence -&lt;/strong&gt; no death. Supreme paramatma, free from Samsara, which is characteristic of worldly existence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;edhi - bhava&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prajahAti {pra-Ha} - renounce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-3-mantra-1-1&quot;&gt;Class 3: Mantra 1-1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agre - before. Sristeh purvam. Prag stristeh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before creation it was in the form of paramatma. After in the form of jagat -&amp;gt; paramatma and jagat are one and the same. Two names because before sristhi it was in karana avasta and after in karya. Bheda is only in the avastha, not in the substance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no svagata bheda (internal difference)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no sajatiya bheda (many different within a specie)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no vijaytiya bheda (species bheda)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cestha - effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#class-1&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-class-1&quot;&gt;Class 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPMvx9NXpxM&quot;&gt;Class 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small prakarana by Shankaracarya&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pravaha - flow, activity, current.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it comes to knowledge, there no division between east and west.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature of work is grow, until it occupies all free time you have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is the means that shapes the end. You won’t get the end independent of the means&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If bhakti is separates from philosophy, it becomes superstitious. Religion loses its transforming power.&lt;/strong&gt; Society comes into focus, not individual liberation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We rise above literality of the mythology and rise to the spirit. That’s why it is called spirituality. If you take them literally, you once again fall into the trap of establishing division.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rishis love to cloud the truth in a symbolic language. Instead of telling that sun’s white light can be split into seven colours, the mantras say that “he travels by a chariot pulled by seven horses”. sa:sapti - horse, ray of light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serpent going and eating part of the sun - shadow. It covers up part of the sun or the moon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In all this stories the literality has to be appreciated and spirit must be understood correctly. Then only there is beauty in those stories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kashi - atmajnanam in this context.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:nija - self&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m is the most fundamental experience of every human being. It is prior to everything else, incl. god.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m is the primordial intelligence. “God is” is not, neither “you’re”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the matrix of I’m? Conscious being. That conscious being is the Kashi - because it is self-shining. You validate the existence of all objects. “I’m-ness” is svayamprakasha - it is prior to perception and thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body makes you limited in space, mind in time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If god is a limited guy, he can have only one center. If he’s spherical. If he’s elipsoid, he can have two. Whereas every human heart is the center of God. He’s infinite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most important, sacred spot in Kashi is the place where bodies are burned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will not be able to invite the truth. It will reveal itself. You only have to prepare yourself for the revelation. The preparation is negation of the identification with the body, which is threefold: me, mine, for me. aham mama mahyam.&lt;/strong&gt; Mahyam gets neutralised by karma yoga. Mama, things related to me, are neutralised by bhakti yoga. Everything is of Ishvara, nothing is mine. In bhakti namah (na mama) is the most important thing. Aham karta is negated by sankhya yoga -&amp;gt; nirahamkara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without crucification there can be no resurrection.&lt;/strong&gt; What resurrects is the Christ who is one with the God - myself and father in the heaven are one and the same. How to do? Begin with namahyam. Then namama.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upashanti: shanti shanti shanti is 3x because there are three kinds of papas. Adhiatmika, adhibauthika, adhidaivika. Each papam is a fire, heat, pain, suffering. Shanti douses all three of them. The heart is at peace.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But Real shanti is not upashanti. It is parashanti, moksha. &lt;strong&gt;Permanent freedom from suffering - nirvana. It is a negative word. It is not a positive definition. I cannot say what it is itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence per se is not important. When the mind is moving, the flow of thoughts is harmless if you know that the content of the mind is unreal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You psychologically depend on that content of waking consciousness for self-fulfillment and happiness and take it to be other. It is a very far and deep ignorance. It can give me sukha and dukha and therefore to have more sukha and less dukha I have to manipulate the content. The flow of mind throws a screen of thought over the truth which is then totally covered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to discover the truth deep within so you can compare it to the mind created world. The mind creates a world for us and presents it to us every day morning. We’re accepting that world and take it to be real and ourselves to be a small part of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rather than taking up the struggle to discover the truth ourselves it is very convenient to handle the responsibility for the truth to the mahatma and start relaxing. How do you know that jagat is mithya? Sastra says that … c’mon! How long will you manage like this? Therefore gain the paramopashanti. That is the real kashi. You get by manonivrtti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose I see a pot. &lt;strong&gt;Now I pay attention to the pot. And now I’m interested in the pot. That makes the pot real. While paying attention and investing interest cannot say a thing is mithya.&lt;/strong&gt; Stop paying attention and interest and see what happens. That is called manonivrtti. Just watch your mind in an uninvolved way. Be kind to it. Do it constantly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De-automatize everything. Like stop talking when you are eating food. Because if you are talking, eating becomes automatic and the attention is on talking and there is identification.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the mind that is functioning through the taste-buds. Just watch it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just watch the mind. Don’t ask how. Suppose you find an agitation in the mind. When the mind is agitated I’m agitated. That is called identification. There is no viveka (between I’m and the mind). I’m and I think are not the same. When you watch the mind it becomes pure. Slowly. Once the mind is pure you’ll know very spontaneously that you’re not the mind but the witness of the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transcending the mind means knowing that I’m not the mind, antahkarana. Antahkarana suddhi is the most important starting point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That silence is conscious presence. It is not a gap, it is not void. It is the kashi. In Kashi there is a flow of ganga.&lt;/strong&gt; Ganga is pure and also purifying. In the Kashi which is in my heart, the Ganga is jnanapravaha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m the primordial light/intelligence. &lt;strong&gt;The moment body comes into the light the world also comes. They always come together and resolve together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The light is the atmajnanu. The brilliantly shining awareness. The Kashi. And the playfulness (vilasa) of the mind is the film.&lt;/strong&gt; Steven Spielberg knows it, that’s why he called his company Dreamworks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world you experience is entirely, not partly, a projection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever is the content of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;, whatever is known to you as part of that content, &lt;strong&gt;that is not I’m.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m is unknown, unknowable, undefinable, undesignated, undifferentiated, primordial awareness of being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t want money, wife and children … what you’re seeking in life is happiness. You’ve a right to seek it. Seeking is right, but the method is wrong. You don’t seek happiness in the other. The other is maya and kalpita (imaginary). You see a movie and feel good. Where do you get that feeling of goodness? From the screen it flows to you? No, from you it flows onto the screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discover it: be sat cit. Then discover the fullness of that. Then &lt;strong&gt;as you discover it, the screen of thought projected by the mind will slowly move away. And the inner silence starts flowing into the life and makes it sacred, joyful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you say I’m rich you’re deriving the sense of self from the riches. When you say I’m the husband you’re deriving the sense of self from your status. That’s wrong. Be the love of the husband. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t derive the sense of self from anything that you know.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t have any identification what so ever.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahatmas find it so hard to identify with anything. Samsaris people readily identify with anything what-so-ever. Be a true nobody, not somebody, then the real self shines in all its glory.&lt;/strong&gt; It is called paramatmarupa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-2-shambhavi-mudra-meditation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4LlgTU8F-s&quot;&gt;Class 2&lt;/a&gt;, Shambhavi Mudra Meditation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;soham - I’m that. That reality. You cannot describe it. The truth is so simple and so profound that language cannot reach it. Truth is not linguistic, truth is existential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The word that can be used to indicate it - Om.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atma, as it reflects in body/mind, the reflection appears as sakshi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manifestation is always the contact. Contact of the infinite (sakshi) with the finite (koshash). Electricity coming into contact with the filament of the bulb appears as the glow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose somebody speaks good or bad things about you. And you just smile and are ready to happily bless both. Then you’re free&lt;/strong&gt; from the bondage - samsara bandha - ashiva - amangala. From the bondage of opposites: punya papa, shubaashuba… All dvandvas bind us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every identifications presents us as a victim to opposites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just be a sakshi. Uninvolved, uninterested, unperturbed witnessing awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t get caught in opposites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job of the sword can’t be done as long as it is in the sheet.&lt;/strong&gt; Its glory is covered as long as it is in the sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is bondage only when you make the fundamental, original mistake of identification. The mistake that amounts to a sin. The name for it is maya, avidiya in the context of individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you living? I don’t know. Just because I’m living doesn’t mean I’m seeking to live. If Bhagavan decides to put an end to this live at this moment it is OK with me.&lt;/strong&gt; With this attitude there is no boktrtva, no identification with the mental/intellectual sheath.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Annamaya is not the bondage. Identifying with it is the mistake. If you’re the body then you won’t know the body. But you know the body. Eyes can’t see themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pot thought is known to I.  I’m aware of the pot-thought. I’m not the pot-thought. I’m a realm of intelligence behind the thought. There is no logic identifying with the thought.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money lost, nothing is lost. Time is lost, something is lost. Character is lost, all is lost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mistake is cognitive, mental. It is the cognitive faculty called buddhi, that is underlying all this five-fold mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ignorant-mind is (called) avidya. Avidya is the buddhi. This avidya is none other than bhavani. Cosmic avidya is called maya, bhavani. In every body this mistake is repeating again and again. Every individual is doing this mistake of identifying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can turn the avidya to your advantage by identifying with the shiva. &lt;strong&gt;Shiva is the purusha. Prakuruti is the buddhi, maya, bhavani.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bhavasya (spirit) patni (wife) - bhavani.&lt;/strong&gt; bhavam samsarinam karoti iti bhavani. &lt;strong&gt;She makes Ishvara, Shiva a samsari.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a witness to the vital force, mind, buddhi, to all enjoyment. Don’t become enjoyer. When you identify with the enjoyment, then you become an enjoyer.&lt;/strong&gt; Be a witness to the ego, it won’t be able to survive. Every movement of ego you just watch. It becomes pure, right ego. Only the ego that has become strong because of identification hurts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In kashi there is shiva (bhava) and bhavani. Shivasya patni - shivA. Bhavasya - patni bhavani. Rudrasya patni - rudrAni. &lt;strong&gt;Sakshi is shiva. Sakshya the five-fold upadhi is the bhavani.&lt;/strong&gt; All bondage is placed the moment you identify.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any-seeker who knows this kashi gains the kashi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4LlgTU8F-s&amp;amp;t=2608s&quot;&gt;Shambavi mudra meditation&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Keep eyes open. Stop blinking for a while. Understand I’m not seeking what is in-front of me. I’m aware of the inner only. I focus the entire eye-sight in the center of the eye-brows. I’m watchful of the center of the eye-brows. There is a watcher and the watched and eventually I become the watchfulness itself. That is called the kashi. Now the awareness instead of being focused on the things is focused on itself. That is the kashi. That is you. You are not what comes to light in that kashi. That is the ego.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The awareness is the Shiva and the center (between the eyebrows) is the kashi. Shivoham.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is the movement of the mind that creates the entire content. Through ignorance the mind gives reality to its own creation. As long as you have interest in the content, attachment to the content, so long you won’t be able to discover the inner silence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kashi ksetram shariram - city of Kashi is entire body. In Kashi you have Ganga. Ganga flows in three lokas. In heavens, earth, netherworld. Tribhuvanam vyapini ganga. Here the ganga is jnanaganga - manifest conciousness. It also flows in three lokas - waking, dream, deep sleep state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three states (waking, dream, sleep) are called sthAna. The consciousness lights up all of them. Yet one doesn’t acquire sthAna dharma. One doesn’t get married/attached to them - identified with the sthAnas. Disassociate with it. Example: &lt;strong&gt;day, night, twilight do they happen to the sun? They just happen as the earth moves around the sun.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing ever happens to you. You’re the forth, the primordial intelligence. That turiya is the Shiva. That turIya is the Isha of vishva - entire universe (all what you see, smell, touch …).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content of the waking consciousness is the vishva. You’re the master of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tIrtha - place that purifies you, road, ascetic, preceptor, channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn-LszH07l4&quot;&gt;Class 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Message of hindu dharma to the entire humanity can be summarised by this single verse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IshAvAsyaM idaM sarvaM - all this is pervaded by God.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anta - essence, end. Vedanta - essence of Veda. Essence comes at the end, just like dessert.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pramA - correct knowledge, correct understanding. Vedanta - means of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Veda is a body of knowledge, collections of words that help us to know. Thus it is a means of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human being is a knowing entity. You cannot but know.&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot help it. Like a flower that cannot help but spread fragrance all around. &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge is the most important thing.&lt;/strong&gt; Human being is essentially the life and capacity to know. Body is the instrument for expression of life. Suppose there is no life the body is a cadaver and not worth keeping around. It is the life and knowledge that is the essence of a human being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karma + jnanam = human being. Jnanam is more important. Action which is not supported by knowledge becomes blind action. That doesn’t glorify anobody.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life (vitality) and light (knowledge) is a human being.&lt;/strong&gt; Light of knowledge is the most important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human being is endowed with &lt;strong&gt;means of knowledge: pratyaksha - perception, anumana - inference.&lt;/strong&gt; They make the process of knowing possible. In the case of animals they are less developed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire science is based on inference. Electron itself is inference only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge obtained through perception or inference is not enough to give fulfilment though. Can’t answer most fundamental question: What am I? What is God? What is the world? While perception and inference will help us to understand the world to an extent, they cannot provide correct information on real nature of the world. Perception and inference are just useful to lead some life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can gain an understanding about those important things using the source of knowledge called Veda. &lt;strong&gt;Veda throws light on these areas which remain hidden from perception and inference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human life is nothing but karma and jnanam. Accordingly the body of knowledge - Veda - is divided into these two areas. A human being cannot but act. Thus the first part of Veda deals with karma - how to channelize it into a higher goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capitalism and communism appear opposite but have the same materialistic premise. Artha and kama. Therefore there is one more, most important aspect of life. &lt;strong&gt;Dharma - moderation, which includes legality and morality&lt;/strong&gt; of earning money. Dharma is appropriate action, composing the karma kandha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Action definitively attracts result. But &lt;strong&gt;when action is performed with knowledge, the result will be more glorious.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In life all suffering has its origin in the smaller picture. I’m so and so and I have my job, my family, my credit card. Everybody needs a smaller picture, even a sadhu. But one should at least pay some attention to the bigger picture - &lt;strong&gt;mystery of the world (jagat), essence of what am I (jiva), ultimate reality/origin (ishvara)? An understanding of the bigger picture makes mind fulfilled. Any time you gain a little bit of happiness you have knowingly or unknowingly transported yourself into the bigger picture.&lt;/strong&gt; When you come again into the smaller picture, you make yourself sorrowful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upa - approaching close, going near. shad - destroy. As you approach the body of knowledge it destroys ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge cannot help you in getting anything directly. It won’t buy you a coke. But it can remove ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWde-1vWU6Y&quot;&gt;Class 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sat, cit, ananda. These alone are one thing only.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose you are speaking about a tasty, fragrant, most enjoyable thing - ladhu. It is only one thing. Similarly &lt;strong&gt;there is only one reality.&lt;/strong&gt; Sat &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; mrtyu, cit &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; ajnana, ananda &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; dukha. &lt;strong&gt;What alone is death that is suffering, ignorance.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose you take care of ignorance you’ve taken care of death and suffering. &lt;strong&gt;In knowledge there is no death and suffering. Correctly you’d be most afraid of ignorance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In jnanam there is no belief. There is only understanding. Understanding brings out terrific amount of hidden energy. There is infinite potential in every human being. You’re potentially divine, infinite. You do not know your worth. You’ve misunderstood yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is nothing as sacred, as valuable as knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the only thing important in life, everything else is secondary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highest disadvantage of technological advances is obesity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disenchantment is a very important aspect of human life. Mind sees toys and gets excited when it gets it and then gets annoyed and seeks for more. &lt;strong&gt;Nobody can satisfy the mind by fulfilling the desires.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of the theologies of the world have a stamp of superstition on their face. To an extend they can relieve a tired human mind, but they fail to bring lasting peace. They cause more problems than the good they bring to one’s life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the single factor responsible for largest amount of violence in social life? Religion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As long as science, religion and philosophy are not integrated it is a danger. &lt;strong&gt;Science and religion can serve us better only when they are integrated by philosophy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schopenhauer: in the whole world there is no study as beneficial as the study of upanishads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without knowledge of the upanishads life can be a burden. Fear of death and struggle of livening cannot be handled with knowledge of the world only. It is not enough to face death with a smile on the face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isha - by Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Newtons vision of the world - mechanistic. The world is a huge machine consisting of totally separated parts, objects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In theology, how the idea of space and time are explained? In theology, the effort is made to understand the known (world) starting from the unknown (god). Nietzche: God is death. When a theologian says “A god in heaven created the world I can similarly say he’s death”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Decarte’s philosophy spirit and matter are totally divided realms. Then add Newtonian world view and theology with a monocratic creator god in heaven to that. Division is complete.&lt;/strong&gt; Everybody and everything is divided from each other. &lt;strong&gt;Isavasya idam sarvam in one stroke negates this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As long as our world-view is based on division there will be no end to conflict and violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRWkuRXE3YE&quot;&gt;Class 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decartes: a person is what his mind is. We identify ourselves so totally with the mind that we lose touch with the reality about ourselves. Joke: Decartes not able to choose from the menu disappears after answering “I think not” to “do you know what you chose?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Division is established because our total identification with the mind.&lt;/strong&gt; In such vision there is no solution for the problems, conflicts and turmoil of life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body is glorious manifestation of universal power called Ishvara. Glory of the body is beyond words.&lt;/strong&gt; Any organ reflects the glory of the universal power so wonderfully. We fail to recognise that glory within ourselves. &lt;strong&gt;We do not identify ourselves entirely with the total organism only with few ideas, with the ego.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus we lose communion with the Ishvara. &lt;strong&gt;Mind has separated from the body and now it tries to control the body.&lt;/strong&gt; Body doesn’t need desert, it is the mind that goes for it. In this way we’ve developed a conflict between the body and the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For us &lt;strong&gt;nature is there&lt;/strong&gt; to be exploited not &lt;strong&gt;to be observed and worshiped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Philosophy of division formulated by Decartes and classical Newtonian physics have downed an era for technological development which has proved to be disaster for environment and social ethos. Parallel to this there is the vision of monarchic God living in heaven enforcing the divine upon these hapless masses and the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedanta is entirely opposite to this vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vision of Isavasya upanishad: &lt;strong&gt;God is everywhere. It is not a matter of belief or faith&lt;/strong&gt;, like God in heaven, to which we have to submit ourselves based on revelation by a divine messenger or messiah. It is a belief system, there is no consensus about the messiah. &lt;strong&gt;Isavasya idam sarvam is a matter of understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; In vedanta we talk of visualising Ishvara and understanding Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Word God has an undesirable connotation. It refers to an gentlemen in the heaven. I’m here, my uncle is there and god is in heaven. With this understanding you can’t deal with the statement of Isavasya idam sarvam, thus &lt;strong&gt;we prefer the word Ishvara. If it needs to be translated, we use Godhead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A theologian starts from the unknown and tries to explain the known in the terms of the unknown. He constructs a verbal structure (system) and tries to fit everything known into it. He’s a prisoner of his verbal structure.&lt;/strong&gt; So the world was created 5000 years and the fossils were put there by god to fool us. This is how theologians and politicians function. &lt;strong&gt;Whereas in philosophy we start from the known and try to understand the unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; This is brahmasutra method in trying to understand Ishvara. We start with “this” and from it we try to visualize the unknown which is Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A worldly person is not interested in the unknown. He only is in the known and he lives his entire life in trying to manipulate it to his advantage. &lt;strong&gt;There is no lasting solution in the known, only in the unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; What is all known is unreal. Whatever is known to you is mithya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unknown means not available for perception and inference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before arriving at the principle called Ishvara we’ve to understand “this” world a little better. Every object is a karyam, effect. In has a beginning and end in time. Pot, mountain, sun, the entire universe is a product. Galaxies are like spots on a balloon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scientist calculated the universe to be 4.5 billions years old based on the expansion of galaxies discovered by Hubble. BG 8th chapter or Bhagavatam dvitiya dhyaya say, there are four yugas. Basic unit is &lt;strong&gt;kaliyuga: 432 000 years&lt;/strong&gt;. Double is dvapara, triple is treta, four times is krta. &lt;strong&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10x. 4.32 mio years is one mahayuga. 1000 mahayugas is one kalpa,&lt;/strong&gt; one cycle of creation. Thus based on Hindu scriptures the universe is 4.32 billions years old.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Rshis knew this is an expanding universe and that’s why they called it brahmANDa - brahma (expanding) - aNDa (egg -&amp;gt; elliptical). Elliptical form is more stable than spherical.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every effect must have an cause. You cannot have a product and claim it has no cause. There is material and efficient cause. A sentient person, desiring person. Desire is important. It is the desire that is the cause of the creation of pot. &lt;strong&gt;In vedic vision all creation has its origin in a desire. That’s why in the upanishadic statements talking about creation the word kama is always used&lt;/strong&gt;. A desire cannot be there without a desiring individual. A desire is the faculty of a concious being. Therefore he’s the efficient cause of a pot. The universe also must have two causes. For vedanta for the universe the two causes are not different, but one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you say god in heaven created the universe you’ve already ignored the concept of space.&lt;/strong&gt; Universe includes the concept of space. Space, time, material of the universe cannot be absolute because they would acquire the status of Ishvara and thus create parallel reality. &lt;strong&gt;Time, space, object are one package. Always together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before creation, there was no space, no time. There is a reality which has manifested as space, time and also the material universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwK2QV_ys60&quot;&gt;Class 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ishvara is the material source (prakuruti) of creation also.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a challenge to relate to this idea. A lazy mind can accept a faith. A mind ready to think can accept this challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All religious beliefs of mankind of all times have understood Ishvara as all-powerful (sarvajna) and all-knowing (sarvashakti). Also &lt;strong&gt;sarvabhavana - all-being. The painter is in the painting.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re not talking about an external ishvara. We’re talking about intrinsic Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire variety of the universe has its origin in one single non-dual reality. What you call energy is appearing as matter and vice-versa. Like one actor in two roles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maker and matter are one. One without a second. Ishvara. Matter + intelligence + power. In a theological mind god is bahiryami - external to the creation and exposing laws from above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:tantra = structure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brhadaranyaka upanishad presents &lt;strong&gt;Ishvara as antaryami. He’s everywhere.&lt;/strong&gt; yat sarveshu bhuteshu tishthan, sarvebhyo bhutebyah antarA.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemistry or physics model of the universe ignores the observer. Vedanta model of the universe takes the observer into account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In vedantic model the universe is what you see, touch, smell, taste, hear. &lt;strong&gt;All the five correspondent elements are called bhutas and Ishvara is antaryami in all these.&lt;/strong&gt; antar -&amp;gt; enter, entry. When you worship Ishvara without recognising this fact your worship is incomplete.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entire universe is the body of Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt; This is how the fact of Ishvara being antaryami is presented.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a seed. This &lt;strong&gt;seed has an intelligence to manifest as a sprout, then stem, branches, roots, leaves, flowers, fruits… All that intelligence and power is inside the seed. Intrinsic to the seed. Not in heaven.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People want to know future. It doesn’t come from somewhere else. The future of the flower is encoded in the flower itself. Similarly, the intelligence, the power, the material is there where the universe there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The future of an object is within the object. The reality of an object is within the object. And that reality is Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Imagine how much energy is released upon splitting an atom. Where does it come from? Outside?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A true devotee is one who consistently wonders at the glory of Ishvara. &lt;strong&gt;Every particle of the universe signals Ishvara to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Special creation, out of nothing, is not acceptable to Hindu philosophy. Indian philosophers are evolutionists, not creationists. Manifestationists in fact (manifestation over a time scale is evolution).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pakistan - holy land.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example for advaiya (one without the second) is space. Ishavara is one without the second.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People are interested in names. Water, pani, aqua … do they mean different things? Same for Ishvara. People care for names, not for the thing itself. &lt;strong&gt;Name is meaningful only as long as it signals a thing to you.&lt;/strong&gt; If it is disassociated it loses its meaning. You can drop it as well then.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ranga give an example for an amphibian! Frog. Very well. Give another example for an amphibian! Another frog… &lt;strong&gt;Human being is an amphibian. You live in a world of matter, life, consciousness (in Ishvara) as a person. That is one world. But we don’t live in this world. There is another world. World of names and forms.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m an Indian in America. White/black. Male/female.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re totally ignorant of the fundamental unity and talk as though the differences as real. In fact this &lt;strong&gt;division is so deeply engrained in our psyche that we cannot think without bringing the gender into the picture.&lt;/strong&gt; There is only life, matter, consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZzwQrxc8J0&quot;&gt;Class 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our world is a very subjective world. It has nothing to do with the reality. It is manufactured from our imaginations, likes, dislikes, mental weaknesses. What ever is within, that is the raw material. We project that world outside. We have to shake that world vision.&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody else fits within that world vision. And nobody else holds on to the same world vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every description of a world has a signature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other observer-based model: The world consists of five elements corresponding to our five sense organs. Every object of this world, living or not living, consists of a combination from these only. We have to reduce the infinite number of the objects of the world for the sake of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As long as you cling to the idea that only names and forms are real, the way reality behind them won’t be recognised. Names and forms are empty shells. &lt;strong&gt;It is the falsehood that binds us. Truth never binds anybody.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The five elements are the same reality. Undivided, invisible existence absolute. The same godhead is behind most subtle akasha and most gross prthivi. There are not five different things only one thing appearing as five&lt;/strong&gt; by the method of tapering. Just like ice, water, steam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Universe is just like jeweller’s shop. The same gold (“IS”-ness) is behind all the items. We miss the IS and hold to the name and form. Example: “What is there? Hand. And now? Nothing.” We’re only conscious of the hand and lose sight of the light and space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where the necklace IS there is gold. It’s not like necklace is here and gold in heaven. Isavasyam idam sarvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is life all around us and all life is Ishvara. Ishvara has eyes, legs, heads … everywhere. All are his. There is no trees standing around - only Ishvara. There are no humans going around - only Ishvara. There are no rivers flowing around - only Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entire universe is the temple and every life-forms is glorious manifestation of Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a theologian god is definitively not here. It’s impractical to have god all the time around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sa:kanya = young unmarried lady.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If lose the spirit and hold on to the customs it is like holding to an empty shell and losing the kernel. In Hindu culture every symbol reflects the all-pervasive nature of god.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inner-most reality of the pot is IS-ness, daivam, Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re the knowledge,&lt;/strong&gt; knowingness, conscious being. That’s why knowledge of pot happens. It means &lt;strong&gt;you the consciousness has modified into the form of pot knowledge and so it takes place. In every cognition the essential matrix of that knowledge is consciousness and that is God. It is in your heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to touch god? Just touch any object only. God is all around. There is nothing other than god. This is god-consciousness. There are many aspects of this God. Jiva, jagat, Ishvara. Who’s the seeker? I. Who’s the seeing? I. Who is the speaker? I. Who is the person that walks? I. &lt;strong&gt;The “I”, the godhead, has many aspects called a devata&lt;/strong&gt; - idol, godhead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is so much wealth, beauty in the creation. It is Ishvara’s. It is Ishvara manifested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can never think of Vishnu without Lakshi. Never of Shiva without Shakti. God has no gender. God of knowledge - sarasvati. In the Veda presented as sarasvan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ultimate truth. I’m not ever separate of Ishvara. I’m the whole, I’m sarvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While desiring a thing, you’re going against your salt - your essential nature. Suppose a millionaire is begging for 10 dollars. Is it the appropriate thing to do? He’s denying his own reality, his own status! &lt;strong&gt;Wanting - unless something comes from outside to us, we cannot be happy. It only manifests the inner lacking. There is nothing that you need, lack, need to be afraid of in this world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every time you’re afraid, you desire something, you’re going against your own nature.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re harming yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Menu: where there are too many items, you cannot enjoy anything. When there is only one item, you discover a wonderful thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can look at every situation in a positive way or in a negative way. Every situation has two sides.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desirelessness is fullness and complete happiness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Philologists are also political people :). Swami TV: I feel English originated from Sanskrit. Greed - gRDhah. Geriatry - jara. Spy - spasha. Mother - mata. Brother - bhrata.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entire universe is not enough to fulfill the greed of one person. Yet it is enough to fulfill the needs of all lifeforms.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be greedy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We should carefully look into our heart and pluck out all the wrong ideas. Under any circumstances we should not fall prey to the weakness of mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One should carefully grow into god / cosmic consciousness. One should not stay a prisoner of local consciousness - I’m a human being, I identify with physical body, go after my likes and run away from my dislikes. And if God helps me with this, I don’t mind praying to him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sahasranama: &lt;strong&gt;primary name is “Om”. Every other is secondary. “Om” is a cosmic sound and bhagavan is a cosmic person.&lt;/strong&gt; Mind has a fancy for variety so you can add some other name, but original name is “Om”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Namah - “na me” iti namah.&lt;/strong&gt; It means “Oh bhagavan, in my ignorance I have assumed I’m an individual separate from you. You’re all pervasive, you’re all. I assumed there are some things that belong to me. And this is wrong”. At least at the time of puja I relinquish what all I thought as belonging to me. &lt;strong&gt;You don’t have to say all of this belongs to Ishvara. That’s clear. You have to say none of this belongs to me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tyAga - relinquishing, sacrifice, resignation, renunciation, divorce.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abhimana - certain things you take as “I”. “I”-sense. And certain things you take as “mine”. &lt;strong&gt;“I”-sense and “my”-sense put together is called abhimana. Another name for abhimana is ajnana.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like some things belong to me. But nothing of this world belongs to me and I don’t belong to this world.&lt;/strong&gt; I belong into Ishvara. Now and here. We should grow into this. Ishvara and jiva are eternal friends.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re very aware of the world, of the relationships, but all that is wrong. We’ve to grow out of the local consciousness. It covers up the reality. God alone is here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re so busy with the world we forget Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God consciousness is called ishvariya vyavahara.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We help a child to grow into local consciousness. All we know is hearsay, not knowledge. What is the basis of our “knowledge”? Mother hearsay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After marriage and living with a young lady for few years, he’s reached a point. One has to grow into god-consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga: communion with God means god consciousness. Because it is like communion with space. It means you feel the presence of Ishwara at all times, everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kamukha = lover, horny&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All manifestation is in the form of opposites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot have a world without contradiction. You cannot have any manifestation without the dharma adharma opposites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a person is pursuing sukha trying to avoid dukha, he is not trying to transcend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditation should always be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incarnation of bhagavan as Kapila. He’s father of Sankhya darshanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only RG Veda is more ancient than Ramayana.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Story of Kardama: he creates an aeroplane and travels all over the world with his wife Devahuti. He married on the condition that later in life he’ll take sanyasa. He did and Devahuti and Kapila were left alone at home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rich people, army generals are not heroes in India. Spiritual people are stars. Dhruva is the greatest devote of Vishnu. He’s the pole star.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pravrtti karma. Lord takes avatara and destroys the adharmic oppressor. In nivrtti dharma there is nothing like destroying the enemy: the wisdom of the self disappears from the society.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staying with the knowledge of self is difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In any given point of time in history of mankind there is few people who take up to the pursuit of self-knowledge. Generally people go after sense-pleasures. It becomes the norm and it doesn’t occur to us that life can be lived happily without.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sense pleasures come always with a price tag. &lt;strong&gt;Life of sense pleasures is a costly life - high maintenance life.&lt;/strong&gt; By pursuing sense pleasures we have to make a lot of money. Only 10% of our income is spent on the necessities. More than 90% goes to the pursuit of sense-pleasures. That’s the life of artha kama dharma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once a person is saturated with the changeful he goes after moksha. Freedom of the life of becoming, of binding of karma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Vedanta first causality is heaven. We’re not interested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can either transcend both pleasure and pain or have both. Can’t have only one. If you want life of becoming you’ll have both. Understanding this is called viveka. Once this is understood, seeking pleasure and avoiding pain will a non-issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of people wanting to know the truth of the self is always small. Like PhD students.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even nirvtti-dharma also called atma-dharma needs to be safeguarded from time to time. The message needs to be given a boost. This is how the incarnation of Kapila has to be understood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A jnani is not a doer. He’s the being only. He is and he has a “IS” fragrance of self-inquiry. That gives a boost to the philosophy. What would have happened to the wisdom of upanishads without Kapila, Shankara, Ramana Maharsi? They came as avatara to protect and boost (atma) dharma. It has to be protected as much as pravrtti dharma. Rama protected pravrtti dharma. Shri Krishna protected both.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greatest treatise of human philosophy is Gita.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kapila was the first evolutionist. Darwin should be called Kapila of the West.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kardama suggested Devahuti can be a sanyasi and stay at home and learn from Kapila, as he’s incarnation of the Lord. Devahuti asked Kapila to teach, without that there is no teaching. This is how the dialog started.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The student should be seeking it. The formality is not a point, but the spirit of seeking must be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the dialogue is between a teacher and a student it is called samvada. If it is between two equals it is a vada. If it is a fight it is called vivada.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge of the world is relative knowledge. Relative of what? Senses and the mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute knowledge is that knowledge which cannot be gained by the help of the mind. Perception and conceptualization as means of knowledge are out.&lt;/strong&gt; That is the knowledge of the self. Atma vidya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without I’m the “world is” situation is not there. “World is” is relative to “I’m”, where as I’m is absolute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The knowledge of the self is always presented in the form of a dialogue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devahuti’s question: what kind of bhakti most appropriate for gaining self-knowledge?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nirvana - cessation’s of all sorrow. Sorrow - fundamental sense of insecurity and wanting in a person. You cannot fill the void by accumulation. The more you accumulate, the more you want.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freedom is our birthright. Who doesn’t need it? The moment we take birth as human being, we have right to nirvana. But you should seek, that is expected from you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Really speaking bhakti means God consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our endowment from the father Ishvara: mind, organs of cognition and action.&lt;/strong&gt; A handicapped persons is handicapped all-right, but his insufficiency can be compensated elsewhere. Mind is there, the &lt;strong&gt;main thing is the mind&lt;/strong&gt;. The endowment has to be used to reach the goal. &lt;strong&gt;Bhakti: effort of utilising this endowment in acquiring God-consciousness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPLoRGejkJY&quot;&gt;Class 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhakti: emotional power (love) directed towards an altar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diving (direct?) expression of ananda, fullness, is love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We should learn to give a new direction to the power of love. Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bhakti as psychological development in a persons life: you learn to ignore what is visible and try to relate to the invisible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We invest all our emotions in the world only. It is one way traffic. &lt;strong&gt;We love the world but it doesn’t love us back.&lt;/strong&gt; As we love it more and more it gives us more and more misery in fact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Motiveless love is neither impractical nor illogical. Just like a mother and a child.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For bhakti the altar must be sattvic. &lt;strong&gt;Sattva: you worship god in the form of knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; God is the repository. Raja: god is the source of wealth and pleasures. Tamasic altar: motive is himsa etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ultimately it is the mind that holds the key to devotion. It is the mind that walks. All movement origins in the mind. &lt;strong&gt;It is the mind that directs the flow of the sense organs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accepted, welcomed (with love) suffering is not a suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can either offer flowers or the oblations into fire, or worship the Lord in the heart of every (human) being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employ our faculties in the service of the humanity all the time being conscious of the godhead. That god consciousness is a must.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who start near go far. Those who start far don’t go anywhere. First discover God in your heart. Normally we feel grievances and other negativity. Eventually we come to feel the endless all-pervading compassion of Ishvara in the heart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any kind of gossip: the main element is mental violence.&lt;/strong&gt; Reason: we are emotionally brute people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;law: whatever you do to the other person you’re doing to your self. There are no exceptions. It goes for gossip as well.&lt;/strong&gt; Medicine: listen to the glory of Ishvara, e.g. vedanta, and enjoy. Fake it till you make it and eventually you’ll discover that love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chocolate, coke, pizza etc. none of it is offered to god. &lt;strong&gt;You should only eat what is offered to god.&lt;/strong&gt; Chocolate is addictive, makes the mind more rajasic, agitated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarly, utilize the speech in singing the glory of Lord.&lt;/strong&gt; Once the job is done, be quit, don’t use it any more. Use it in the service of others and then don’t use it any more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our life should be like a river. If it encounters an obstacle, it doesn’t go back. It overcomes it, sometimes it just floods it, and moves forward. It never stops and goes until it reaches the ocean. Then &lt;strong&gt;it loses its individuality. That is the highest sacrifice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is generosity of the heart and of the hand. Later is easy. &lt;strong&gt;The real generosity is recognition that I own nothing. Even this body I don’t own. I’ve borrowed it from the nature all around.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every motive defines and strengthens the ego.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rise above the crippling sense of isolation. That is the real bhakti. This leads to moksha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kosha - cocoon. Prison house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;koshakara - silk worm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;koshakara does only two jobs. Eat and spin the silken thread in which they bind themselves and die. We spin the bonds of attachment (me and mine) and die in that kosha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear comes out of attachment. We are selfish because we don’t want to suffer. We want to carry the past pleasure into future. Because of this fear of future pain we accumulate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real devotion: I surrender my welfare, future, to Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt; This ability to surrender is very rare.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One who doesn’t bother his yoga kshema (acquisition and keeping), who have surrendered, will never come to grief.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We believe that we believe in god. We believe in money, in our attachments, in worldly things. &lt;strong&gt;If we really believe in God than from this moment onwards we don’t have an iota of concern about future. Having surrendered, you will never ever come to grief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Western countries have best medical facilities yet worst fears of death.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live of &lt;strong&gt;glorious uncertainty - surrender to Ishvara. I don’t know where my next square meal will come from, but I’m very comfortable. A millionaire is not so comfortable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nobody knows what will happen in the future, really.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When we least expect it, we’ve got grace of Ishvara in copious quantity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crystallised ignorance - self-identity with the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a true devotee Ishvara is the beloved, self, devoted son, friend, guru, suhrt, altar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We should not look for priya, we should look for hita (that which is good for us in the long run).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mitra - friend (mutual help). suhrt - he doesn’t expect any help returned. There is only one suhrt in the universe - Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repetitive thing - dulls the mind, it goes to the hibernation. &lt;strong&gt;Quality is important, not quantity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physically we depend on everything. Psychologically we don’t depend on anything and anybody. All psychological dependence is directed to Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at the rising sun is never a repeating experience. If looked at in the freshness of present movement. Without memory of it; that is dead. There is joy, communion. That’s how you look at the alter, that’s how you have to repeat the prayer. Even when saying the simple name “Rama”. There will be so much love. &lt;strong&gt;Main obstacle is repetitive, dull mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear is always about the future. People are sorrowful about the past - shoka. Only solution - surrender to Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the sun. It always rises in the east and goes down in the west. Look at the clouds, wind, heat … There is absolute reliance on Ishvara&lt;/strong&gt;, on the supra-personal power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ikrY1_G7M&quot;&gt;Class 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a person’s life there is personal order. There seems to a be a (limited) choice, freewill there. An there is the supra-personal order. You cannot postpone the sunrise. It functions relentlessly whether you like it or not. A person is in trouble if he allows for a conflict to rise between these two orders. Every desire is a conflict between these two.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desire: you’re not satisfied with what IS.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re not satisfied with the supra-personal order. Desire is a gulf between what is and what should be. What should be is the agenda of the mind. Never resists mentally to what is. That leads to emotional distress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In jnani’s life the boundary between the two recedes and recedes until the two become one. Personal will is resolved in the supra-personal order. That’s how a jnani functions. &lt;strong&gt;Whatever comes before a jnani, he accepts. And whatever he doesn’t have, he doesn’t even think of that.&lt;/strong&gt; One has to examine one’s life carefully and learn to surrender to the higher power. That’s what is called bhakti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our lives are commanded by a mysterious higher-power. &lt;strong&gt;When we give a name, we believe we know. But naming is not knowing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unless there is an identification with the body, the relationship cannot have any meaning. Love is not dependant upon a relationship. It is like rose.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I only know how to love. Whosoever comes in-front of me, I just love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no problem in the bigger picture. It is totally free from the problems of living.&lt;/strong&gt; When abiding in the smaller picture (me, mine syndrome), you can never get a lasting solution for the problems of the smaller picture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mind manufactures life for us. That is the smaller picture. You’d be able to consistently rise above this mind-made world.&lt;/strong&gt; This ability is the bhakti. In one stroke, you’ll have solved all its problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Negation of ego - sharanagatih, true bhakti. Rising above the smaller picture and learning to visualize, understand the bigger picture. In doing so life comes to a settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People generally don’t have settlement in life. They have issue with God, society, community, themselves … &lt;strong&gt;Settlement: psychologically settled. A person at peace, in harmony.&lt;/strong&gt; Reason is the smaller picture becomes overwhelming for us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When true bhakti is followed evtl. settlement comes when I realise that my true nature is brahman, divinity itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-knowledge is not knowledge of the self. It is the knowledge of what all you’re not. Ego is an entirely mind-manufactures, mythical, non-real entity. It is an image manufactured by the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the meditation you rise above the confines of the person and abide in the impersonal awareness. That is what is called sakshi bhava. You get an insight that you’re prior to the mind, ego, body identification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bhakti: make the rascal called ego a servant of god.&lt;/strong&gt; As the bhakti increases the devotion decreases. This is the river merging into the ocean. This is the goal of human life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Young people, dominated by rajoguna, before emotional maturity - give a set of rules and a target. He’ll do that. Not able to be absorbed until sattvaguna is developed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering love to the higher power, with or without a form, can happen only when you have dispassion towards the things of the world&lt;/strong&gt;. Like pumping water upwards - there must not be any holes. Similarly mental energy called love will not go higher unless you withdraw it from the things of the world. This is called vayragyam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raga-bhakti: You’ve love for ishvara. You see flower, you remember Ishvara. You see sky, remember Ishvara … &lt;strong&gt;Beauty of moon, sun … are portals to the glory of Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt; Once a person is established in raga bhakti, motiveless devotion to ishavara, he’s not restricted by rules and regulations any more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sun is rising. Small picture: time for breakfast and office.&lt;/strong&gt; Breakfast and office will be there. We go about doing the things we have to do. But the smaller picture will not overwhelm me. &lt;strong&gt;Sun is rising. Big picture: I look at the cosmic person itself. Soham. Ishvaras glory is reflecting in the solar or and at the same time reflecting here in the heart.&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller picture has its relevance but we should never loose sight of the big.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is fear and insecurity in the small picture&lt;/strong&gt;, within the smaller picture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lotusfeet: padapadma, padamula. Literal translation doesn’t work. The meaning is self-surrender.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;World has its own altars. Money, pleasure… At which we surrender day after day. There is only one place to surrender, the lotus feet of Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ultimate well-being. Realization of the true self. Yogi is a sadhaka. A striver. One who pursues the path. Jijnasu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before going to the temple I should look at my self. What is my status? What am I? Esp. when dealing with a bhakti sastra as Bhagavatam. I’m a devotee. Baktoham and only then enter. Until one does this, the temple visit is not going to bring any real transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you come to the vedanta class. Ask the same. What are you? I should look at myself and then give autosuggestion “aham vijnasu”. This vicara is not meant for a samsari!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga is a very special means. Means of communion. Discovery of inner divinity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhakti should always be associated with viveka jnana and vayragya. If you have atma jnana you don’t need yoga anymore. It is the ultimate. In gita, jnana is viveka jnana - knowledge of discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing that the world is a trap, not real, an appearance. That knowing is viveka. Resulting dispassion if vayragyam. These two are the prerequisites for bhakti yoga.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viveka: we take a lot of sorrow and fear from the world as we interact more and more with it. Vayragyam: interaction with the world will be to the exactly required extend only. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/strong&gt; Now bhakti is in place and takes you go the goal. In this life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Constant refrain of Shri Krishna towards an individual: try to be nirmamo, nirahamkara. That is self-surrender.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We should have bhakti that is not shattered by circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discrimination is the ultimate means of self-realization. Sastra is not going to present self on a platter. The labor of the sastra is discrimination between atma and anatma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is only knowing of the non-self as non-self. There is no knowing of the self.&lt;/strong&gt; Then if there is no identification with the non-self, then remains and shines only the self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ishvara is called Shesha (residue, remainder) because he remains in the process of all negation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First vivekaprakriya. Then sarvatmaprakriya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laws of Vedanta: 1) whatever begins in time ends in time. 2) whatever begins and ends in time is unreal, whatever might be the length of the timescale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance only proves non-reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reality has nothing to do with sentimentality. Reality does not respect sentimentality. What appears without really being there is mithya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the entire sastra, wherever you see the world jnanayoga, it is viveka jnana yoga.&lt;/strong&gt; If you neglect viveka, you’ll miss sarvatma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both prakuruti (five elements -&amp;gt; body, mind) and purusha (atma) are found in the same medium. That’s why discrimination is needed. Where is the mix-up? In the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pascal: As the physical body I’m a speck engulfed by the vast space of the universe. But as the mind, I have the power to understand the entire universe. Vedantin: as a mind, I know the universe. Not only that, as atma, I’m the universe. I’m the conscious being. The subtlest entity in the universe. That is sarvatmabhava. That is moksha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire physiology belongs to the nature. Not to the purusha - it is the conscious being. Body is called a city of 9 (gita) /11 (kathopanishad) gates. Sun of atma is reflecting (purushete) through the mind in the body. Purnatvat purusha - atma is purna.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_KrKpat0m8&quot;&gt;Class 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prakuruti purusha viveka - most important topic of vedanta. Purusha in vedanta means life and intelligence (not intellect) put together.&lt;/strong&gt; Name for it is atman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is one hallmark of Shankara bashyas? Discrimination he emphasizes. He ended up writing a book on it - vivekacudamani.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re deriving a sense of self from the physical body. I’m male. I’m born in Andrapradesh …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People are so much concerned about health, well-fare of the body that the concern itself becomes a problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop intelligent indifference towards the body. It will remain in its place, healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not the body. I’m aware of the body in action. I use it as a tool. And I’m always conscious of the body as the other. I maintain it well, neither pamper it nor neglect it. Manage it with intelligent indifference. Withdraw obsessive care from the body and see what happens.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind is the meeting point of life and intelligence with the matter which is the physical body.&lt;/strong&gt; Of spirit and matter. Spirit being cosmic life and intelligence. Matter being conglomerate of the five elements - physical body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind, because of its crudity and ignorance identifies with the physical body instead of identifying with its source which is the spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body has a form. Aliveness is formless. &lt;strong&gt;As I identify with the body there is a sense of separation. The world is the other.&lt;/strong&gt; When you abide in that aliveness you don’t experience any otherness. When you look at the body you’re in the grip of the time. Body has time imprinted in itself. Like wrinkles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is nothing like death. &lt;strong&gt;Body is formed by integration (negative entropy) and disintegrates (positive entropy). In jnanis vision death is not an event worth looking at. He’ll be happy to face death. You need not protect the body, you need not feed it. All this trouble will be ending once and for all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;True self is not tainted by the qualities of the prakuruti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind is a tool, an instrument of cognition. You’re not the mind. Watch the mind. Instead of we use the mind &lt;strong&gt;the mind uses us. We live a life dictated by the mind, because of the identification with the mind. Mind is prakrti, it is the product of the food we eat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to do meditation, you’d have command of your food habits. Suppose you have a heavy breakfast and try to do mediation. As the food is put in the stomach you become tamasic. Further sleep. Lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you know that there is a bright line in a spectrum? Because there is a dark line above and below. You will not know a bright line if there are no dark ones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it comes down to Vedanta, you’d have a big grip on language and pronunciation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without the immobile the mobile cannot exist. The motion is always relative to something.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body is always in motion. Not even an entity. It is an flux. There is a &lt;strong&gt;law of Buddha: law of impermanence of forms. It looks like a form but it is a flow, a changing thing.&lt;/strong&gt;  The underlying reality that doesn’t change is the pure “I’m”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The being doesn’t require another means for knowing. It is knowing itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t try to derive pleasure from the mind. I don’t need mind to be happy. Then you’ll discover the real happiness.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise you’ll be running after pleasures. You become happy and you will become unhappy also. Mind cannot sustain pleasure for long. It is an excited state. It will have to come down. &lt;strong&gt;Excited state is the most uncomfortable state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Qualities of the mind seem to taint me but the fact is I’m not the mind. I’m the immobile, upholding the mobile. Whole life is spent identifying with the mobile. As long as you do, you remain ignorant of the immobile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hit the table. Both the body and the table change. If there is no change, there is no action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m is the window to the truth. Hold on to it and it will tell you the true self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You cannot expect the guru to inquire on your behalf. What we want is to give a check to the guru so he will reserve a small piece of heaven for us. Guru can only show the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are not the physical body. Guru is not the physical body. You take yourself to be the body so you take the guru to be a body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m - the awareful presence. It is the verification, the truth, of everything. Of all. Is there any doing in it? Doing is in the mind, sense organs, body, world. Doing is motion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discovery: The being, shining as the knowing, without any doing in it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheerful - sattvaguna. Sorrowful - rajoguna. Dull - tamoguna.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be at peace. Forgetfulness doesn’t belong to you. “I’m” will be forever with you. Gunas don’t belong to atma, the self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re hypnotised to believe we’re the doers. A fan is rotating. Is electricity is rotating? Without electricity can there be any rotation? Atma is not the actor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There can be action without the actor. Rose blossoms, the fragrance is spread all around. Where is the actor? Like the rose the universe has blossom. When I speak it is something like that. Body - given. Intellect - given. Language - given. Sastra - given. Speech - given. Memory - given. Nothing authored by me.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you plan and forget or forgetfulness happens? Memory, does it happen or you remember?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If at the end of lesson I feel I’m the doer, it will be a huge burden. Let there be action. If you don’t identify with the action then you’re not a doer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the action is planned, there is a result. The moment a result is there, there is a will which is the doer.&lt;/strong&gt;  Another case. There is action. But there is no result, no will, no doer. But there is purpose. It is very fruitful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: outcome directed towards the self.&lt;/strong&gt; Result - phalam. Purpose - prayojanam. Result establishes you as a bhokta and bhoktrtvam establishes you as a karta. Don’t even think of the result.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will is that which attracts the result to itself.&lt;/strong&gt; When there is no will there is just action. That action liberates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m the doer. The truth (“I’m”) got mixed up with the untruth (“doer”). Where is the motion, in the mind or in the witness? All movement is prakuruti, none in purusha. Aham karomi is the delusion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are the hearer you should be able to hear when you want and not hear when you don’t want.&lt;/strong&gt; But hearing happens regardless of your will. There is no freedom for you. Same for seeing …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t feel it the blank “by whom”. You need not have a doer every time. &lt;strong&gt;Action can be there without a doer.&lt;/strong&gt; There is love in such action. And then understand that you’re not the doer in any given situation. But there can be doership if you wrongly identify with prakuruti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What you have to do, you need not be told. Right action follows right knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m the being shining as the knowing in which there is no doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOXXS5o-qAU&quot;&gt;Class 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wherever you find people organising themselves understand that they are insecure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify with jnana indriyas, you’re a bhotka. Identify with the karma indriyas, you’re a karta.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re not the walker. You’re the knower behind the walker. Just go for walk alone and be alertful. The same walking develops a new dimension.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Samsara: being caught in the cycle of pleasure of pain. As long as one identifies with the body, he’ll be caught in the cycle of opposites (pain/pleasure, dharma/adharma, birth/death).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First reason: no vayragyam. One is a go-getter, wants to grab and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoyment of sense-pleasures always comes with a price. There is always hangover. Sense pleasures don’t come easy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every act of sense pleasure enjoyment reinforces the idea that you’re a bhokta/karta.&lt;/strong&gt; Every selfish act accumulates. Present lot is the direct result of accumulation of actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suffering I’m going through now is the direct result of karma (karma dosha).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every human being is a mishra. +/- 50:50 of sukha dukha. What good try to look into future for how much sukha is there and trying to manipulate? Therefore human being, know your essential nature - brahman - and be liberated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you saw is unreal. That you saw is a fact.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose the dream is nightmarish, it makes you suffer. Suppose it is pleasant, but makes you happy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They day you’re ego-less, the purpose of this bhakti, where there is an element of plurality, is over. Until then, you have to pursue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let the other people be whatever they are. Never try to command, dictate. It is for them to choose the path. Give total freedom. If they’re not choosing the right path, give advice. If they don’t follow, no problem.&lt;/strong&gt; They will pay a price and learn and come back. We should not allow such freedom to our mind. It should be brought under control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I use the mind, when I need to think. &lt;strong&gt;When the need for thinking is over, I should be able not to think.&lt;/strong&gt;  Listless thinking - just following non-sensical flow of thought. Compulsive thinking - &lt;strong&gt;the origin of sorrow and fear is thought. If you stop thinking, there will be no sorrow&lt;/strong&gt;. But that is not the solution really, when you live you have to think.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tormentor is not the boss at the office. The tormentor is sitting in your mind.&lt;/strong&gt; It is you who allowed him to become a tormentor. Compulsive, listless thinking are the enemies. Because mind is threading wrong path, it is attached to the sense pleasures, to the things of the world. That’s why it is accumulating sorrow and fear. Turn it back. Change its character. Purify the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purity of mind is priority for any individual who wants to live peaceful life. What we really need in life is not pleasures, but peace and harmony. Develop dispassion towards the world and love towards Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose you go to a friend and tell “I love you because you did not press to return the loan you gave me”. How will he feel? Suppose he says “I love you for what you are”. &lt;strong&gt;Conditioned love is not love.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose you go to god and tell “I love you because you’re the husband of goddess of wealth”…  If you love me for the sake of some other thing, you’re not a student of Gita.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devotion purifies the mind and neutralizes the ego like nothing else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhaktrhari: vayragyam eva abhayam. &lt;strong&gt;Real wealth is not bhagyam, but vayragyam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A cow can eat a nice fruit with a gusto as well. A human being comes to glory only through vayragyam. Enjoyments of sense pleasures animals also have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vayragyam won’t come by itself. You have to cultivate it. Nature of mind is that it wants to accumulate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just accumulate enough so the body can be used. Not more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accumulation begins with wealth. Having accumulated enough, we accumulate objects of the world. Then relationships - networking - connections.&lt;/strong&gt; For what? It makes us samsaris. We won’t be left with any energy to contemplate upon ishvara. We have to &lt;strong&gt;seek solitude. Meditation is the appointment with the inner self.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live simple and noble life. God consciousness must be reflected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shanti - cessation of mental noise. That’s what we have to seek. It opens up reasonless spring of joy. Ramathirtha: &lt;strong&gt;You need a reason to be joyous? It is slavery!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unless body and mind are healthy, you cannot transcend them. What you gain with the mind is not the truth in any case. We bother about mind so it won’t come in the way. Like dealing with a thief. To make body and mind pure you need yoga.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The backbone is line an antenna. It should not be crooked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahmacarya in the context of grhastah means to be loving to your partner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t accumulate. Give away. Don’t throw away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put flowers into hair, dress nicely … but don’t go for fashion. Dress and body must be clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forgiving: in-spite the other person committing a mistake, I don’t hold it against him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obsession with progress is unnecessary. Contentment with what I have is important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tapas - &lt;strong&gt;you voluntarily take up some difficulty for the body. You should never give up tapas.&lt;/strong&gt; Sadhus: you don’t get breakfast? Take it as tapas. Shift the focus of attention. Do the same with body pains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surrender: I accept what is. What is not, I do not desire.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re in harmony. Peace. &lt;strong&gt;Be happy for grace of Ishvara has no bounds. Whatever happens is compassion of Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt; He’s like a rain bearing cloud. Isvhara gives only blessing, it is us who make misery out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Ul1TbMgmg&quot;&gt;Class 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sitting posture is very important. Upper portion of the body should be erect. Legs should be close to the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To begin with, you need some effort. Eventually the asana should become effortless. And the mind should resolve. What remains is ananta. When the mind is functioning what you’re with is the limited.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initially we need a posture. Evtl. the posture becomes irrelevant. You’re calm and quiet. You’re watchful and alert and abiding in the svarupa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prana means cosmic life. Prana is not the life in this body.&lt;/strong&gt; Living beings are many, life is universal. Just like light. It is universal yet it reflects in a particular body. &lt;strong&gt;Life is there in every particle. Whole universe is intelligent universe, including the matter. It is not dead matter&lt;/strong&gt;. Life in the context of the individual body is expressing as respiration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are two kinds of pranayama. Willful and without.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prana is the limb between matter and spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pratyahara - being indifferent to sound. It is not the sound that is disturbing. &lt;strong&gt;Stop resisting any sound, become indifferent. Not resisting nor welcoming any sensuous stimuli.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pratyahara is important as the mind runs away through these five windows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As sophistication increases it becomes very difficult to satisfy sense organs and we become slaves to them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thoughtless, not mindless.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pratyahara you don’t practice separately. It is always with dhyana (very focused meditation) or dharana (broad focus).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’d not enforce anything. If you don’t feel like doing it, don’t. We should not pursue puja/meditation because we fear God. We’d love it. Fearlessness is the first quality a student of vedanta should learn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing is the link between finite and infinite.&lt;/strong&gt; Stay with it and you’ll get an insight about the infinite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infinite is an negative word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Study of vedanta without devotion - sushka vedanta. Parambrahma is not sat cit alone, it is ananda also. It is rasa. Even in sadhana you’ve to bring the love for Ishvara. Fake it till you make it. Listen to the glory and exploits of Isvhara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Healthy people are generally happy. And vice versa. Because all illness originates in the mind. &lt;strong&gt;If the mind is pure and loving, your immune system will be very good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the mind there is a habit of categorising people, life-forms etc. Rise above all of that, all life is sacred. Be equanimous towards all life-forms. &lt;strong&gt;Sarva bhuta samatvam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love can conquer the worst hell also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is simple, &lt;strong&gt;if you are attached to the things of world, you don’t love God.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t fall into the trap “world is nothing but God so loving them is as good as loving God”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love is not the same as attachment. Suppose I’m attached to the son. It is harmful for the son and for me also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prasanga - attachment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;svadharma - I do my duty with love, commitment and devotion. I have duties, not responsibilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Krishna in Gita doesn’t speak of responsibilities. &lt;strong&gt;Duty is what you do in the present. Responsibility is what you seek as result in the future.&lt;/strong&gt; The more we understand this, the more we can be at peace.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Duty + your greed for the result = responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People don’t love God. They love their concept of god. And they don’t love so much the others’ concept of the god.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practice maunam. You’d speak in measured tones. You’d speak when you have to. Don’t speak untruth. “Speak the truth” would give license to speak 24h a day. Do it for a weak and your mind becomes so calm you cannot believe it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Excessive consumption is unspiritual. Don’t waste water, money, food, … Always take a little less than you need and then finish it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without meditation you have no chance to come into contact with reality. To make it work, you have to prepare well. One of the preparations is &lt;strong&gt;don’t accumulate, don’t consume much and be happy with what you have. Never complain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Sivananda Lahari by Swami TV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlnKfuGpoz0&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind is a movement. It has to flow either towards samsara or towards Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no 3rd flow. As it contemplates upon Ishvara there is a reasonless joy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind becomes what it things upon. &lt;strong&gt;When mind contemplates upon Shiva that is enough to bring out inherent joy as wave after wave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhakti is an emotion. It is not knowledge, it is emotion. It prepares the mind for higher knowledge by purifying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shivas feet - lotus like - aravinda. Aravinda is the lotus which blossoms as the sun rises in the east. Sun stands for knowledge, for atma. Aravidma stands for the mind which is ready to receive that knowledge. Isvaras feet are always compared with the lotus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you take literally that becomes religion. If you take spirit, it becomes philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spirit of holding on to the feet of Shiva is total self-surrender (sharanagati).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always contemplate: consistently, perseveringly. Not every second of the waking state. &lt;strong&gt;Instead of contemplating things of the world we may better contemplate on Lord Shiva.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A heavy laden mind cannot go towards Isvara. The mind should be simple, subtle, light. Story in Purana: when a person dies there is a devaduta standing there with a balance. The suksha sharira (mind) is put into one pan and in the other weights are put. If it is light it goes to heaven, if heavier it goes to hell. Therefore our emotions should be simple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The river, no matter where it has taken birth, it has only one goal - ocean. The mind should overcome the absorbing power of samsara and ultimately reach the ocean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is Isvara who makes the first step, then it must be our effort. Like a creeper. It chooses a tree and then starts growing in that direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inching towards Isvara is equivalent to inching away from samsara.&lt;/strong&gt; Ramakrishna: Love towards Isvara grows in direct proportion to dispassion to the things of the world. You go towards east and west simultaneously. Dispassion towards things of the world and motiveless devotion to Isvara progress simultaneously. The more we get entangled in samsara, the more devotion gets less and less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no chaos in the world except the chaos you have in your mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The devotion should not be seasonal (when things go well).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devotion is entirely our effort. Isvara made his will very clear - come near me and I will protect you. Now it is for us to go near.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The river just relinquishes names and form. It doesn’t give up its true individuality of being (water). It becomes one with the infinite. Bhakti becomes one with the infinite but it must be in such a way that egoity must be neutralized.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egoic state - where there is an effort to preserve the identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love for the world is called attachment. The same love directed towards Ishvara is called boundless.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love is such a thing, unless we put bounds in ignorance, it has no bounds.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like space. Mahatmas don’t restrict the love.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Samsari’s love is a vector. Jnanis love is a scalar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is notion that beauty has to come from outside things by reorganizing things. Same for happiness.&lt;/strong&gt; Societies across the globe are moved by this notion. Because I’m disenchanted in the heart and I want some respite from it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doing is not intrinsic to atma. &lt;strong&gt;Atma is being and knowing. Doing is there and there is purpose for it - antahkarana shuddhi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind is limited in the sense that whatever it can think of is always limited.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the essence of a tree? Fruit. What is the essence of cow? Milk. &lt;strong&gt;What is the essence of a human being? Ishvara bhakti and jnanam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Except bhakti there is nothing else in the heart. Then you have the crop, which is self-knowledge. That life only is fruitful. Any other life is wasted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the creation ends the devatas resolve also in Parameshvara. They are also part of samsara only. Even a little peace of real happiness one won’t get from worship of devatas. Ananda devata cannot give.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devote: “Sri Krisha make my mind pure and make me happy” - he knows how to and can grant. If you ask for a new car, he’ll consult his prarabdha …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no real happiness in pursuit of all this. I don’t want all this. I’m done with that. I want only one thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having created duality out of language now you have to negate it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shakti resolves in the being becomes Shiva. The becoming aspect of Shiva is Shakti. The resolution of Shakti to being is Shiva.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isvara being ananda, how can there be dukha in the creation? Ananda is the upadana of the universe. Why there is dukha? That’s our creation.&lt;/strong&gt; Isvara doesn’t know how to create a dukha. Dukha is created by jiva. Not god, thus god will not be able to remove it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleasure and pain always go together.&lt;/strong&gt; Stomach pain I create. By overeating in the night. Why? Because I want … pleasure. &lt;strong&gt;As you pursue one you create the opposite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is wrong with accumulation. Cups and saucers behind a glass in a cupboard!? I’m looking for some meaning it it. Then we come to Vedanta. And we accumulate emotions. A child does not. As the emotions are accumulated we become heavy laden like a ship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What we are accumulating is terminology. Vedanta is all about unlearning. Nothing new you learn. Nothing new you get. &lt;strong&gt;Good Vedanta teaching is that demolishes every possible concept that a person has in the mind and leaves him free and open so he can be the truth which he already is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People have become linguistic. They are no more existential. Biodata is my linguistic “being”, all mithya. What I’m truly cannot be put in the biodata, even one word.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re totally deluded thinking that literature and language is the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We accumulate formulas. Will they eliminate this horrible samsara? Are they helping us? Will they remove it? We must honestly examine it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long will it take for you to come to the truth? Stop the accumulation. Collect all the formula in one place. Make it simple. Develop devotion. Purify your heart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect and showcase formulas. It will not save. Ultimately there is only one way - sharanagatih. Oh, intelligent person, you’ve learned enough of new things. What you’ve learned start practising and develop that total inner devotion to Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A time comes when we’ve accumulated enough. Now it is time to take stock. Keep what is required and take proper steps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First step is freedom from the concern of the future. It is horrible egoic state. The only way is Ishvara sharanagati. Then be open minded, don’t have too many expectations. Dismantle the entire structure of expectations.&lt;/strong&gt; Then let the future unfold itself. &lt;strong&gt;Allow the life to unfold itself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Did you take lunch? When are you leaving?” Simple and practical. What is there to discuss about the concern of future. Whenever there is concern about the future &lt;strong&gt;enjoy the glorious anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt; Allow it to unfold. Devote to Ishvara. &lt;strong&gt;I pray only one thing: give me the strength to face the future.&lt;/strong&gt; Ability to surrender to Ishvara. Only a strong mind can surrender.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All self-seeking is a violence. We take the same self-seeking to selfish pity-mindedness to the religion. That’s why it doesn’t have any transformative power. It seems to have become dumb. Public show is not religion. Private communion!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We should not try to impress god. We should surrender to god. Spirit of self-surrender alone bridges the gap between jiva and Ishvara.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devotion is not an easy thing. We’re more devoted to the world than to Ishvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind offering is meditation. No more karma. No object is offered. That is the greatest worship. This wisdom, entirely by your grace, has taken root in my heart. I’m fulfilled. I surrender day after day at your lotus feet. Whatever wealth, resources … are needed, you take care of it. Devotee won’t suffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deva - shining. The one light that is always shining: consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Happiness flowing from (coffee) cup into heart -&amp;gt; revert.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By conditioning gold as neckless you have not made its value lesser.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold is the origin of necklace and gold abides in the necklace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Existence has an opposite - non existence. Being has none. Being is the foundation of the entire universe. Being is atma, the essence of entire universe of forms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parayanam - supreme goal to be reached by devotees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatever is nama rupa is not tattvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isvara is tattva of all tattvas, supreme tattva.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who begins near goes far. Who begins far does not go anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sat = cit, cit = sat. &lt;strong&gt;What you know exists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smallness of the pot is attributed to akasha which is not small.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Difference between chaos and cosmos is rtam and satyam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purusha is reddy all over the body except black/blue neck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Do not let anyone overpay you</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/dont-let-anyone-overpay-you/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The moment one customer pays you a lot more than any other customer, you’re no longer a product but a consulting company working for the big payers. You’ll do what they say.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We would never allow a customer to pay more than top-tier price. If you’re a bit company with special demands, we don’t want your money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We wanted to build a self-service software company. Not need an army of key account managers keeping the whales happy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strength of numbers. Not large numbers of dollars. But large numbers of customers. Diverse customer base.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Said no to people, companies, … we admire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Amor veneno</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dealema, álbum: &lt;strong&gt;Arvorada da Alma&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Dealema-amor-veneno-lyrics&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depois da tempestade vem a bonança&lt;br /&gt;
Depois da calamidade vem a esperança&lt;br /&gt;
Como a fénix, renascemos das cinzas com a arte de viver&lt;br /&gt;
Depois de um expresso que navegou o submundo&lt;br /&gt;
Depois da noite escura da alma e da grande tribulação&lt;br /&gt;
Acordamos para a primavera da vida&lt;br /&gt;
E através das trevas chegamos sem tempo nem hora marcada&lt;br /&gt;
À alvorada da alma&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ainda não partiste e eu já tenho saudades&lt;br /&gt;
Das longas tardes, com novas amizades&lt;br /&gt;
Na esplanada a beber limonada gelada&lt;br /&gt;
Piada lançada, é geral a gargalhada&lt;br /&gt;
Bem sei que nada dura para sempre&lt;br /&gt;
Como castelos de areia que caem de repente&lt;br /&gt;
No zénite os raios atingem-me a pique&lt;br /&gt;
A sombra não encontra a pele com salitre&lt;br /&gt;
Quando o mercúrio sobe, o suor escorre&lt;br /&gt;
A melancolia some, a aura explode&lt;br /&gt;
Intensidade, insanidade temporária&lt;br /&gt;
Paixão tórrida, alma purificada&lt;br /&gt;
O ócio da espreguiçadeira na palmeira&lt;br /&gt;
É o fim do estio, e esta noite é a derradeira&lt;br /&gt;
Não consigo esperar pelo próximo episódio&lt;br /&gt;
Vou atrás de ti até ao trópico de capricórnio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando o amor se torna veneno e a vida muda&lt;br /&gt;
Mas as impurezas purificam-se com a chuva&lt;br /&gt;
Mágoas afogadas em águas passadas&lt;br /&gt;
Pessoas íntimas tornam-se inimigas&lt;br /&gt;
E o vento leva a memória das nossas vidas&lt;br /&gt;
Como folhas já castanhas&lt;br /&gt;
O sol ilumina as nossas almas&lt;br /&gt;
São mais uns dias, dias quentes&lt;br /&gt;
São noites frias, noites frias&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A temperatura cai como a verdade, não é a fé&lt;br /&gt;
É o amor que tem a força que ajoelha a humanidade&lt;br /&gt;
Natureza é sinfonia, ou sentes ou não sentes&lt;br /&gt;
Quando sentes, ‘tás a medir a pulsação à vida&lt;br /&gt;
Pulsar do tempo que abana as folhas mortas&lt;br /&gt;
Deixa cair as tuas, tu também te renovas&lt;br /&gt;
Acreditas ou não? Eu acredito em magia&lt;br /&gt;
Desde o dia em que vi a cara da luz que hoje me guia&lt;br /&gt;
Espírito é navalha com que marco o que valho&lt;br /&gt;
Desenho a eternidade na casca de um carvalho&lt;br /&gt;
Norte magnético, focar no essencial&lt;br /&gt;
O cheiro da terra faz-me sentir especial&lt;br /&gt;
Prefiro ser fiel, do que infiel ao ser&lt;br /&gt;
E assumir forma diferente da minha forma de ser&lt;br /&gt;
Amor é ser tocado, outono é ser amado&lt;br /&gt;
Como a tecla de um piano que nunca foi afinado&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando o amor se torna veneno e a vida muda&lt;br /&gt;
Mas as impurezas purificam-se com a chuva&lt;br /&gt;
Mágoas afogadas em águas passadas&lt;br /&gt;
Pessoas íntimas tornam-se inimigas&lt;br /&gt;
E o vento leva a memória das nossas vidas&lt;br /&gt;
Como folhas já castanhas&lt;br /&gt;
O sol ilumina as nossas almas&lt;br /&gt;
São mais uns dias, dias quentes&lt;br /&gt;
São noites frias, noites frias&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bate leve levemente como quem chama por mim&lt;br /&gt;
Será amor certamente e o ódio não bate assim&lt;br /&gt;
Desavenças vão são como chuvas de inverno&lt;br /&gt;
Cinza, bom tom, no eterno eu hiberno&lt;br /&gt;
No portão do inferno a sedução é o convite&lt;br /&gt;
Eu vou pelo que sinto e nunca pelo apetite&lt;br /&gt;
Eu admito, por vezes gelo e sim, eu sou frio&lt;br /&gt;
Cheio coração quente assim que vazo este vazio&lt;br /&gt;
Por ti fí-lo, algo pensei que não faria&lt;br /&gt;
Teu ombro o meu asilo, de bom grado me isolaria&lt;br /&gt;
Em tom grave declamaria “0tou grato pela companhia”&lt;br /&gt;
Não brado só alegria, neste rádio és sintonia&lt;br /&gt;
Quando choravas chovia, via o sol quando sorria&lt;br /&gt;
No nosso copo d’ água tempestades não havia&lt;br /&gt;
Senti logo à primeira sua energia&lt;br /&gt;
Mel, tornou-me fiel, monogamia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;01--introduction&quot;&gt;01  INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sutra - small statement with lot of ideas packed in it. Aphorism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audio/oral tradition, not visual. Writing was not there and even when it came, it was not used very much.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A huge book can be compressed into few sutras which are memorized. Sutra method has been devised because of memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sutra method - putting all the ideas in metrical verse form. Poetry form. It is easier to remember a verse form. There is a rhythm and you can tune and sing it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahmasutra: 555 sutras take about 10 pages when written down. When expanded you can write books and books. It’s like an atom bomb.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Task 1: Extracting the vedantic teaching through upanishadic interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Task 2: Defending the teaching by answering charges of other philosophies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Task 3: Offense: “What right you have to talk about logical defects when your system is full of logical loopholes?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Qualification 1: readiness for hair-splitting. Once the question of interpretation comes hair-splitting of words, sentences and ideas is involved. Thus this book might appear too dry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Qualification 2: study of at least 10 upanishads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We do not require Brahmasutra (BS) for jnanam and moksha. Any competent teacher teaches BG and upanishads only based on BS. Therefore study of BG and upanishads is indirect study of BS and therefore enough for jnanam and moksha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BS is considered as one of the three basic texts of vedantic teaching. BG - smrti prasthanam, upanishads - shruti prasthanam, BS - nyaya prasthanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BS is not required for a student, but very important for a teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;02--introduction&quot;&gt;02  INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellect, intelligence, power of reasoning is the extra faculty because of which human being is different from all other animals.&lt;/strong&gt; If you take it from the human being, it is as good as an animal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to judge, form opinions, have goals, develop plans and work for the achievement thereof. Thus &lt;strong&gt;every human being is a thinker&lt;/strong&gt;, whatever be the level of thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every serious thinker will have to analyze six topics and form a clear conclusion.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;jivah - what is a living being?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;jagat - what is this world?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;isvara&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;bandhah - why human suffering? Why misery, bondage, samsara?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;moksah/mukti - freedom from bondage&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sadhanam - means by which one goes from bondage to liberation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consistent view/teaching regarding these topics is called darshanam. The one who founds such a philosophy is called darshanikah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are six nAstika darshanani and six astika darshanani. nastikas - veda pramanam nasti:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;carvaka - materialists. No dharma, no heaven, no hell, no punarjanma, no veda, no atma … only sense pleasures as the ultimate goal. Modern science is very close to materialistic philosophy. Founder brhaspatih released this philosophy to destroy the asuras, as they will not accept the veda. brhaspatih prathama sishya was carvakah. He got this name because his speech is so convincing: enjoy life! Who has seen sukshma, karana sharirams? I’ve seen no such thing. caru - beautiful, vac - speech. It is so wild, uncivilized that it is not dealt with in BS.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;jaina darshanam. Supposed to be given by 24 acaryas, beginning with rshabadevah and ending with vartamana mahavirah (also known as jinah - one who has conquered himself, therefore jainism).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;four branches of buddhism. Buddha - enlightened, wise. He did not systematically teach a system of philosophy. He gave stray statements to people who approached him. Therefore initially Buddhism was not a well-developed system. Three early scriptures - tripitaka. Sanskrit -&amp;gt; Pali (&lt;code class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; got lost in the names): abidharma -&amp;gt; abhidamma. One original Buddhism gave later birth to four branches: sautrantika, vaybhasika, yogacara, madhyamika.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Six astika darshanams:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sanhkya darshanam of kapila muni.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Yoga darshanam of patanjali.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Nyaya darshanam of gautama.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vaysheshika darshanam of kanAda.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Purvamimamsa darshanam by jaimini rishi. Based on veda purva bhaga - karmakandah.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Uttaramimamsa darshanam of vyasa. Importance is on veda uttara or anta bhagah. veda purva is not thrown away but supporting the vega antah.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are all astikas because they accept veda pramanam but not all of them accept isvara (1, 4, 5).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First four accept veda pramana but give more importance to tarka (reasoning). Therefore them and all nastikas are called tarkikah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All these astika darshanams are in sutra form. Uttaramimamsa sutrani is also known as brahma sutrani or vedanta sutrani or shariraka (=atma) sutrani or vyasa/badarayana sutrani.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahmasutras, being dense and short statements, have given birth to more than ten interpretations. Tree are very popular:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;nirvishesha advaitam as revealed by shankaracarya bhasyam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;vishistadvaitam through shribhasyam by ramanujacharya.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dvaitam based on the commentary by madhvacarya called anubhasyam.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;03--santi-mantras&quot;&gt;03  SANTI MANTRAS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the teacher doesn’t do homework, he cannot communicate properly. If the student doesn’t do homework, he cannot listen/grasp fully. The more homework both of them do, the more is the amount of grasping (vIryam).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teacher needs compassion, sishya needs confidence into the teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gopayati - to hide, to guard, to protect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mantra 4 by trishanku &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidsgen.com/fables_and_fairytales/indian_mythology_stories/trishankus_heaven.htm&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishanku&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;I’m as great as the Lord, I enliven, invigorate all the creation. I’m as glorious as the Lord. I’ve got the greatest wealth in the world which is brahmajnanam.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;om aham vRkSaya rerivA; kIrtih pRSTham gireviva; Urdhvapavitro vAjinIva svamRtamasmi; draviNagm savarcasam; sumedhA amRto’kSitah; iti triSaNkorvedAnuvacanam; om zAntih zAntih zAntih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mantra 10 from svetaasvatara upanishad of krishna yajurveda: &lt;strong&gt;I’m surrendering to the Lord (sharanagatih). It is your job to rescue me from samsara. If I require a guru, you provide. If the guru is not competent, you make him competent. If I’m not, you make me competent. All responsibility is yours - beautiful surrender attitude. Jnana yoga is preceded by sharanagatih and it ends in sharanagatih only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hiranyagarbha (Brahmaji) is also a disciple of Ishvara because he gets vedas from Ishvara alone. The only difference - he doesn’t require the systematic teaching. Doing tapas he gathers this wisdom in the form of intuition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;04--dhyana-slokas&quot;&gt;04  DHYANA SLOKAS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Narayana (Bhagavan Vishnu) is the first acarya. He created Brahmaji who became the first disciple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hiranyagarbha or Brahmaji is called Padmabhuvam since he appeared out of lotus according to puranas. Padmat sambhavati (spring up). &lt;strong&gt;By sheer meditation he was able to grasp the teaching. Vedic wisdom arose for Brahmaji.&lt;/strong&gt; Vishnu served not as visible guru but as ashariri guru.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third acarya is Vashista who is disciple of Brahma. Each one happens to be both putra and sishya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vartikam is a critical commentary in verse form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Narayana parampara is aviccinna (continuous) because I’m able to learn it even now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alayam - temple, abode. sruti-smruti-purananam alayam kuranalayam (abode of compassion).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shankara {sham+kara} - making auspicious&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First shankara refers to lord Shiva. That Shiva alone has taken birth as Shankaracarya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vyasa - avatar of keshava (Vishnu). sUtrabASyakRtau - &lt;strong&gt;Vishnu (as Vyasa) wrote BS and commentary was written by Shiva (as Shankara)&lt;/strong&gt;. Another conclusions. &lt;strong&gt;All the other darshanani were created by human intellect, only vedanta darshanam available in BS is not a product Vyasacarya’s intellect but it is the teaching extracted from upanishads. Thus Vyasa is not the founder of vedanta darshanam, only codification, systemization and giving supportive logic is Vyasa’s. Vedanta darshanam did exist even before Vyasa, starting with Narayana, unlike the other darshanani.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shivasya hrdayam vishnu vischnosca hrdayam shivah.&lt;/strong&gt; Vishnu and Shiva are one and the same. Narayana is Sadashiva.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lord Shiva appears in three forms. Isvara (prameyam - subject matter). Guruh (pramanam - the teaching). Jivatma (sishya - pramata - the knower).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vyomavatvyaptadehaya. One who’s real nature is allpervading caytanyam like the akasha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;05--outline-of-brahmasutras&quot;&gt;05  OUTLINE OF BRAHMASUTRAS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankaracarya: even if you give any credit to me, all credit belongs to the previous acaryas who have done the work. What a humility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the beginning, the two sounds &lt;strong&gt;OM&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;atha&lt;/strong&gt; (now) came from Brahmaji and therefore they are auspicious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In BS there are four adhyaya - chapter. Each chapter is subdivided into four sections - four padas. Each section is divided into topics known as adhikaranam (total of 191). The number of adhikaranams is not uniform among sections. Mots of the topics are taken from the upanishads. Each adhikaranam is subdivided into a certain number of sutras (total 555).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Broadly four topics are discussed. Samanvaya - consistency. Vyasa presents consistency as the proof (hetu) that brahman is the central theme of the upanishads. Other darshanams, esp. sankhya and purvamimamsa do not accept this but say theme of Vedanta is karma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd chapter deals with avirodha - non contradiction. Vyasa establishes that brahmavidya doesn’t have any contradictions. Three types of contradictions: internal within the Veda itself, no contradiction with smrti, no contradiction with logic. Heavily logic based.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3rd chapter deals with sadhana. Preparatory disciplines for gaining brahmavidya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4th chapter, the smallest, is called phalaadhyaya. Deals with moksha. Krama mukti and satyomukti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedantic statements are like flowers but are not arranged, it is a wild growth. BS serves as a thread for stringing the upanishadic ideas who are like beads (191 beads/flowers). Thus presenting a beautiful vedantic sastra garland - a systematic philosophy (darshanam)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Condition for enquiry - doubt. No need to enquire into the obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;06--two-types-of-inference&quot;&gt;06  TWO TYPES OF INFERENCE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If perception can’t be used directly, inference is used. &lt;strong&gt;If the inference is to be valid, it has to be based on observed data. Suppose one doesn’t collect any data, that is imagination, speculation, wishful thinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Components of &lt;strong&gt;inference (anumana)&lt;/strong&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;paksha - locus of discussion. Matter of dispute. It has to be visible or known. There is visible and invisible part. We’re proving the invisible part. E.g. parvataha.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sadhyam - conclusion. Always apratyaksam (not known). E.g. agniman.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hetu - reason. E.g. dhumavat. Always pratyaksam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;drsthanta - example. E.g. yatra maha nase. I don’t say smoke invariably co-exists with fire. We only say the fire invariably is where smoke is there. Yatra yatra dumah tatra tatra agnih. Oposite we can’t say (e.g. body has fire - 38C yet no smoke).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whole logic is studied only to intellectually see the finer distinctions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E.g. &lt;strong&gt;vyapti jnanam = knowledge of invariable co-existence&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. of fire along with smoke). vyapti (invariable co-oexistence) has &lt;strong&gt;always two factors. vyapyam (smoke) and vyapakam (agni).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The vyapam in the vyaptivakyam alone becomes the hetu in the anumanavyakam. The vyapakam alone becomes becomes sadhyam. Therefore either &lt;em&gt;yaytra yatra vyapyam tatra tatra vyapkam&lt;/em&gt;. Or &lt;em&gt;yatra yatra hetutu tatra tatra sadhyam&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Only if vyaptivakyam is valid, then alone the anunamana vyakyam will be valid. The only means of validating the vyaptivakyam is perception.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A scientist is using only this method alone. Inference is based on observed data alone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conclusion that we arrive at will only about that objects from where data has been collected.&lt;/strong&gt; Data (hetu) and conclusion (sadhyam) will with the same object (paksha). If I collect some data from my blood therefore I’m healthy/sick, not my mother.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Science is collecting data on the world. All observed data deal with anatma. Therefore if scientific reasoning is used, all the scientific conclusions will be about anatma. Therefore entire scientific reasoning is called laukika anumanam. Therefore &lt;strong&gt;scientific reasoning has no access to atma vidya.&lt;/strong&gt; Tarka can never prove anything in regard to atma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both laukika and sastriya anumana involve data collection. &lt;strong&gt;Difference is with regard to the source of data: observation vs. sastram. Because we as astikas accept sastram as another valid means of collecting data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A scientist might question the conclusion but no scientist questions the observations. The whole science is based on the assumption that observation is valid, truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the sastric anumanam the reason (hetu) be based on sastram, in the scientific on observation. &lt;strong&gt;For sastriya anumanam the student must be astika&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laukika anumanam is never used for establishing Vedanta. It cannot prove nor disprove vedantic teaching.&lt;/strong&gt; Some nastika philosophers wrongly use laukika anumanam to disprove vedanta - wrong field. &lt;strong&gt;Vedantin uses scientific reasoning to show the fallacy of scientific reasoning used by other philosophers to disprove Vedanta.&lt;/strong&gt; We use logic not to prove that vedanta is logical but to prove that it is not illogical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;07--adhyasabhasyam&quot;&gt;07  ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both anumanani are dependant on data and do not question the validity of the data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of them has got different field, perception (anatma) vs sastra (atma). Neither of them can prove or disprove the other. We only use laukika anumanam to prove its fallacious application in establishing the illogicality of Vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedanta is not logical nor illogical, it is supralogical. Don’t use logic to prove or disprove vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other philosophies like buddhism arrive at the truth of atma or the truth of the world using laukika anumana. We want to establish that truth can never be established by using laukika anumana. Thus we use laukika anumana to disprove all their conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mohammed Ali: You might be the greatest but I’m the latest. &lt;strong&gt;Tarka can give only working knowledge of the truth. But it cannot tell me what exactly is truth. That’s why the conclusions are changed always when new data comes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use science, which is glorious, for functional knowledge. Never try to use logic or the science to know what is the truth. The truth is apaurusheya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To expect everything to fall within science and logic is to show shortsightedness. There are things which are outside the scope of science. By using scientific logic you can never cross the samshaya (doubt) sagara. 27 theories on creation. Previously I was confused, now I’m confounded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adhyasabhasyam - introduction to BS. &lt;strong&gt;Adhyasa - error, mistake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establishing that all human suffering is because of a mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only when the error is gone the error-caused problem is gone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any error is because of ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the rope in front is not visible clearly, it is mistaken as snake. 5 bhutas are mistaken as Brahman in the same way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In total ignorance there is no error (ignorance is bliss). Example: sleeper. In total knowledge there is no error (knowledge is also bliss). Example: wise person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Error happens only in partial darkness and partial light. Thus there is partial knowledge. I know there is something (samanya jnanam - partial knowledge). Samanya amsha - thingness (“Is”ness) of the rope. But I don’t know what it is. Samanya amsha is anavrta amsha, not covered by darkness. It is satya amsha. It’s particular part, the ropeness is covered, which is the specific feature. “Ropeness” - vishesha amsha (specific feature). It is covered - avrta amsha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is” part = samanya amsha = anavrta amsha = satya amsha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rope part = vishesha amsha, avrta amsha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the place where the real vishesha amsha is covered I replace with another mithya vishesha amsha which is called snake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In every error there is a satya amsha and a particular unreal, specific feature - vishesha amsha, because the real feature is covered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The correction is not in samanya amsha. It doesn’t require any. Correction takes place only in vishesha amsha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m is real. Samsari - mithya vishesha amsha. Real vishesha amsha - asamsari brahma, anandah. &lt;strong&gt;I’m sat, cit is evident. What is covered is ananda, ananta, asamsaritva, limitless, purnah amsha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Epistemology - study of knowledge and error.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;khyadivada - erroneous discussion of errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;08--adhyasabhasyam&quot;&gt;08  ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-error is corrected only by self-knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three errors/knots:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;anyatha grahaman. Mistake - miss the real and wrongly take something else. That is from the standpoint of the rope.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhyasa - superimposition. From the standpoint of the snake.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;satya anRta mithuni karanam - mixing of real and unreal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aim of BS: unknot sthula, sukshma, karana sharira knots.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake is saying “there is (real part) a snake (unreal part)”, not being aware that there are two entities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long snake or curved snake  - satya amsha because the attributes belong to the real rope.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frightening, poisonous snake - anRta amsha because the attributes belong to the snake.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m so and so. Conscious existent being is satya amsha. Person is anRta amsha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Six topics of Adhyasa Bhasyam:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhyasa lakshanam - &lt;strong&gt;definition of error: Perception of object on wrong locus. A person can never superimpose a snake if he has not seen a snake. Mixing of real and unreal. Example: “I’m the body” - seeing the immortal, all-pervasive I, who is not the body, as the mortal, limited body -&amp;gt; error.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhyasa shankha - objection to the theory of error from other philosophers. They say superimposition requires four conditions: a) perception - it has to be in-front of me and evident b) ignorance regarding the fact that it is the rope c) there should be a similarity d) pruva anubhava samskara - it must have been experienced before.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhyasa shankha samadhanam - answering&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhyasa sambhavana - possibility&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhyasa pramanam - proof&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhyasa apasamhara - conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedantin’s counter to 2):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a) pratyaksha-vishayatvam: For a mistake to take place the object should be known/evident. It need not be in-front, need not be pratyaksa-vishaya. Atma is evident enough. Even though it is not pratyaksha, not object, but evident as the subject. Thus first condition is prakasha manatvam (knowable), not vishayatvam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;b) ajna tattvam (partial covering): aham asmi - sat chit is evident but not that aham ananda ananta brahman asmi. Atmavid shokam tarati is not evident to a samsari.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;c) sadrshyam: similarity between the rope and snake. It is a general condition but there are exceptions to it. atma anatma adhyasa comes under this condition thus the rule is not required. Atma anatma are in fact diagonally opposite. Example: blue akasha. Sky looks like a vessel turned upside down. Akasha is nirupam. It is falsely superimposed. For space, there is no comparison with anything. Same for ocean.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;09--adhyasabhasyam&quot;&gt;09  ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2) d) samskara: False snake is possible only if there is experience of real snake. Thus without the experience of real anatma how can I have the samskara? Previous experience of a snake is required but it must not be a real snake. I can have an experience of a false snake which can create another false snake. Example: experience of a snake in a snake movie. First false adhyasa when? anadi avidya vasanaya. Thus real anatma is not there, unreal anatma has been there from beginning-less time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This was just a provisional answer. The real answer: adhyasa between atma anatma is primarily based on veda pramanam. Rope snake example is not for proving adhyasa. Adhyasa is derived from sruti pramana.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rope snake is just to show corollaries - secondary ideas. It is not meant to prove the adhyasa, proof is in the veda.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This adhyasa should no be questioned by these astika purvapaksis because they themselves have already accepted the adhyasa&lt;/strong&gt; in their systems. All talk about an atma and &lt;strong&gt;based on veda pramana they accept that I the atma is nityah. When you say “I’m a human being” the meaning of “I” is referring to the body. Similarly for “I’m mortal”. Thus they accept this knowledge is an error, as deha-atma buddhi error.&lt;/strong&gt; Sthula sharira adhyasa is accepted by all the astika systems. 2nd chapter of BS deals with nastikas. If dehatma-buddhi is not accepted as error, you’re at the carvaka level. In vedic times carvakas were criminals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All astika darshanani say - atma is all-pervading, formless, part-less, niravayam and shtula is limited, with parts. There is no similarity - sadrshyam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similarly rope-snake adhyasa cannot be questioned because it is based on anubhava. How does it happen? Each philosopher has his explanation - kyativada. Advaitin: anirvacaniya. Sankaracarya says “whatever”. You all accept the adhyasa, one is based on sruti, the other on anubhava.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The quarrel is only in the extent of adhyasa. Tarquika: I’m anityam, karta, bhokta. Nyaya: anityam is superimposed, I’m karta and bhoka. Sankhya: aham anitya, aham karta are errors, bhokta is fact. Advaitin: all three are adhyastam: anityatvam, kartrtvam, bhoktrtvam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- adhyasa pramana - proof --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5) laukika pramanam works only in anatma prapanca. Once we come to atma it has to be sastriya pramanam. Then either anumana or arthapatti pramanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arthapatti - postulation of an idea to explain a particular fact. Example: I get up and see a lot of water (proven fact) all over the street. Thus I postulate last night it must have heavily rained.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kathopanishad I - II - 19: &lt;em&gt;If the slayer things “I slay”, and if the slain thinks, “I’m slain” then both of them do not know well. This slays not nor is This slain.&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; I’m not bhokta, I’m not karta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gita 5 - 15: &lt;em&gt;Atma doesn’t take neither the punyam nor papam of anyone.&lt;/em&gt; There is also another statement in the sruti which says atma is nirvikara (changeless). Experience, karta and bhokta require change. Thus atma cannot be neither. Thus thinking “I’m a kartka/bohkta” is an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;10--adhyasabhasyam&quot;&gt;10  ADHYASABHASYAM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arthapatti - without postulating an idea the fact cannot be explain. Even though the idea is postulated it becomes valid knowledge. Example: wet road. No doubt, it is based on perception. Postulation of the idea that in the night it must have rained. There was no experience of that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is experienced need not be postulated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Derived knowledge by arthapatti is called arthapatti prama. If it is based not on pratyaksha but on sruti it is called sruthyarta pramanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adhyasa is not directly mentioned in shruti. It is valid knowledge postulated on shruti pramanam. Example sruti says “I’m immortal”. Thus “I’m mortal” is adhyasa - error.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sruti says atma is akarta -&amp;gt; atma is karta must be adhyasa. Same for bhokta. E.g. see Kathopanishad I - II - 19.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m knower is another adhyasa. I’m consciousness is not superimposed. Atma is jnanam not jnata. See Mandukya Upanishad 7. Atma is not waking knower (visva), dream knower (taijasa), sleep knower (prajna). Why? Atma is nirvikarah. See BG 2 - 24.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kartrvam, bhoktrtvam, knowing all of these require change because they are process.&lt;/strong&gt; In sanskrit any &lt;code class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, in english any &lt;code class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;er&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; suffix  indicate modification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any karta has to be associated with a karanam, with an instrument. Same for bhokta, same for pramata.&lt;/strong&gt; They all have sanga with the instrument. &lt;strong&gt;Sruti says clearly atma is asangah.&lt;/strong&gt; If it is asangah, can it be a pramata? Thus if atma is akarta, then kartrtvam must be an error, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atma means I.&lt;/strong&gt; I mistake myself as the knower, enjoyer, knower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parichedatvam. I’m limited, here. “Here”-ness is parichedah (limitation) and that is also adhyasa.&lt;/strong&gt; See Kathopanishad I - III - 15. &lt;strong&gt;Limitlessness alone is called brahmatvam. Limitation is jivatvam. Jivatam is error.&lt;/strong&gt; Aham brahma asmi is a fact, aham jivosmi is an error called adhyasa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atma bahutvam is accepted by all other philosophies. Anekatvam is also an error.&lt;/strong&gt; See Svetasvataupanishad 6 / 11 or Isavasya 7.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another method to prove adhyasa is anumanam - inference - based on co-existence of two things. Yatra yatra dhumah tatra tatra agnih. &lt;strong&gt;Shankaracarya: any TX proves adhyasah. Yatra tatra vyavaharatvam tatra tatra adhyasthavatvam.&lt;/strong&gt; Because atma cannot do any TX. Because atma is different from the body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the cow goes after the grass it is because it thinks I’m this body, which is hungry and grass will remove the hunger. This vyavahara is called pravrti (going after) vyavahara. It cannot happen without dehaadhyasa. Human being is not much different from cow in this aspect.&lt;/strong&gt; He goes after nice food, goes away from fire… &lt;strong&gt;All human activities are based on adhyasa.&lt;/strong&gt; Life is getting and getting rid of.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In our transactions are two things involved. Atma and anatma. But we are not aware and in our vision there is one single mixed-up entity. Aham janami. &lt;strong&gt;It looks like there is one single entity - Knower = chetana tattvam + jadam (vrttih) part.&lt;/strong&gt; Chetana atma does not have modifiction. Acetana vrtti doesn’t have consciousness. &lt;strong&gt;In every TX sat cit amsha belongs to atma, changing amsha belongs to anatma&lt;/strong&gt;, thus all TX base on adhyasa. See atma bodha 25 and 36.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- adhyasa upasamhara --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6) conclusion of adhyasa bhasyam. Adhyasa is dangerous, harmful to entire humanity because it alone brings anityatvam. Adhyasa:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;-&amp;gt; constant insecurity,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;-&amp;gt; constant fear of death,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;-&amp;gt; security seeking through money, corruption becomes rampant,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;-&amp;gt; problem for future too: karma -&amp;gt; punya/papa -&amp;gt; punarapi jananam/maranam&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adhyasah eva samsarasya karanam.&lt;/strong&gt; Jnanam = adhyasa nivrtti. See BG 2 / 55: &lt;em&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;a man completely casts off all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self&lt;/strong&gt;, then he is said to be one of steady wisdom&lt;/em&gt;. BG 3 /18: &lt;em&gt;For him there is no interest whatever in what is done, or what is not done, &lt;strong&gt;nor does he depend upon any being for any object&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-11--14827---1st-sutra-athato-brahma-jijnasa&quot;&gt;Class 11 / 14827 - 1st sutra: athato brahma jijnasa&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire samsara is due to this basic error alone. Because of which we enter into different types of activities because of the notion I’m karta/bhokta. Not only laukika but even vaidika karmas are based on this error alone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of this drstha adrstha phalam alone there is the punarapi jananam punarapi maranam cycle. Thus root cause of all problems of life is adhaysa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Various levels of adhyasa: 1) Primary error. I’m a pramata. Because of mixing up of atma and antahkaranam. 2) through the mind the error flows down to the sense organs -&amp;gt; secondary errors like “I’m blind/dumb/deaf”, which is a problem of sense organs. 3) antahkarana adhyasa -&amp;gt; indriya adhyasa -&amp;gt; sharira adhyasa. Aham strI, purushah, vrddah, sthulah, krshah, tarunah …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ahamkara adhyasa -&amp;gt; mamakara adhyasah. I belong to them, they belong to me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One has to work for the removal of this adhyasa. Adhyasa itself is the product of ignorance. Self-error is born out of self-ignorance. It is not physics-, dance- nor music ignorance. Any other knowledge we gain we are not able to remove self-ignorance. Narada with a huge list of degrees approaches sanatkumara, he’s aware he’s both learned and successful but still in grasp of grief. Sanatkumara: tarati shokam atmavid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-error is&lt;/strong&gt; not because of total ignorance of self. But &lt;strong&gt;because of partial ignorance of the self.&lt;/strong&gt; Sat is known. Cit is known. That’s why I say aham asmi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we say brahmajnanam we are not going to know a new thing called brahman. Brahmajnanam means knowing the brahman status of mine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the real status is not known, a false status is taken up - jivatvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Correction is knowing my brahman status and displacing the jiva status. For this purpose alone begin all the &lt;strong&gt;Upanishads. All other sastram take our inferior status as a fact, having taken it as a fact they are prescribing methods for improving the status.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the methods is acquiring money, power. &lt;strong&gt;Assuming that inferior status is a fact karma kanda says go to heaven and become Indra.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedanta is not for image building but for the negation of superimposed low-image&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- adhyasabhasya is over, 1st sutra begins --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1st chapter: samanvaya (consistency) anvayah. 1st topic: jijnasa adhikaranam. 1st sutra: athato brahmajijnasa - &lt;em&gt;hence (it is to be undertaken) thereafter a deliberation on Brahman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1st sutra is introduction into brahmavidya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduction is like a door of the house. It is not inside nor inside. So is introduction - a connecting link, neither inside nor inside. Like 1st chapter of BG. Not part of the sastram yet required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anubandah - an appendix, a pre-appendix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sastram beginns with the 2nd sutra only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An introduction to any sastram should present four factors - anubandha catustayam:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhikari - audience in mind, target group. The competent, eligible student for brahmavidya. For BS it is sadhana chatustaya sampatti: shreya preya viveka (discrimination), vairagya (dispassion - considering all other pursuits to be secondary), shatka sampatti (sixfold inner discipline), mumuksutvam (desire for moksha)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;vishayah - the subject matter: brahman. Not a new thing but a new status of the listener atma. My own higher status.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;prayojanam - negation of abrahman status of mine which is my misconception. Brahmatvam knowledge will displace jivatvam misconception. brahmatva jnanena abrahmatva nivrtih prajoyanam. mokshah - freedom from the sense of limitation, smallness, inadequacy, want.
  4 . sambandha - relationship between the textbook (BS) and the subject matter (content. Revealer (BS) - revealed (Brahman) relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion: seeing the means as the end. Dispassion, maturity: seeing the means as means (to moksha). Foolishness: not seeing the means as means.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shatka sampatti:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;kshama - mind control&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dama - sense control&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;uparama - reduction of extroverted-ness (withdrawal)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;titiksha - capacity to ignore discomforts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sraddha - faith in guru (incl. scriptures (Vedanta) and God)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;samadhana - commitment on one goal&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-12--14828&quot;&gt;Class 12 / 14828&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upodghAta - introduction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A topic can be considered as a subject matter of a book only if the topic is discussed as the central theme of the book. Example: dietary discipline in Gita is not its subject matter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anubandha catustayam is not the direct but implied meaning of the first sutram - arthika artah (indirect meaning).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;srautah artah - direct meaning: &lt;em&gt;therefore brahman enquiry should be done&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vyasa’s aim is to extract the philosophy of the upanishads not propounding a new system. Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;whenever Vyasa writes an sutra he has in mind a particular portion of the upanishads&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore to understand the right meaning, we should always know what is the upanishadic portion kept in mind by him. That upanishadic statement is called vishaya vakyam. &lt;strong&gt;Without bhasyam we can never know the vishaya vakyam of many sutras.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taitriya 3 - 1 - 3: &lt;em&gt;oh Brighu, conduct brahma enquiry to get peace, security, happiness, to get rid of boredom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chandogya 8 - 7 - 1: &lt;em&gt;you have to know the self&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brhadaranyaka 2 - 4 - 5: &lt;em&gt;nobody loves anybody, everybody loves oneself alone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Self alone is object of love. Self alone is loved by all. Whatever is the object of love is of the nature of ananda.&lt;/strong&gt; In the crisis we drop everything, even children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marriage is like a tennis game. You start with love and fight like hell later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering ananda requires self-discovery.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore Yagnavalkya tells Maitreyi atman enquiry should be done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kartavya - should be done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This enquiry can’t be done independently because brahman is not an object in-front. You have to necessarily take the help of the upanishad-microscope&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus we replace the word brahman enquiry and replace it with vedanta sastra vicara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Naya: paksha: vedanta sastra. sadhyam: enquired. hetu: anubandha catustayam. drsthanta: dharma sastravat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vypati: yatra yatra anubandha chatustaya vatvam, tatra tatra arambaniyatvam. Whatever sastra has anubandha chatustayam, all those satra are worth studying. Because we get the benefit of moksha out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implied meaning: vedanta sastram has anubandha catustayam. Direct meaning: vedanta sastra should be studied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-13--14829&quot;&gt;Class 13 / 14829&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;atha - two fold function: sound (shabda) and word (padam). Every word has two status. Prameyam when it is listened and pramanam if you understand the language.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prayema - object of any pramanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The very sound “atha” as vibration produces auspiciousness.&lt;/strong&gt; When it also functions as a word it is artha bhodaka - it gives meaning. Every text should begin with mangalam, if it does not, we should not read it. Therefore there is a tradition of writing a mangala shloka. Vyasa is writing BS in sutra form thus he has no opportunity to write a mangala shloka. So he uses the word “aath”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words “om” and “atha” are mangala shabda. Because Brahmaji started the wonderful creation after uttering these two words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“atha”&lt;/strong&gt; has many meanings - prajonana, mangala… Here Shankaracarya chooses after analysis &lt;strong&gt;“anantaram” - thereafter, immediately after.&lt;/strong&gt; It indicates immediacy. After what? &lt;strong&gt;After qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Any study should be after yogyata siddhi anantaram. &lt;strong&gt;For studying vedanta it means sadhana catustayam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thus atha means here sadhana catustaya anantaram. How do we know this is the meaning? a) logic. From observation we come to know that whoever has sadhana catustayam is able to get the benefit of vedantic study - moksha. On the other hand a student without sadhana catustayam doesn’t derive the benefit even if he does sravana manana nididhiasanam for a million of janmas. b) sruti. Mundako upanishad 1.2.12: learning from kicks in life what is permanent and not (viveka). Wanting the permanent (vairagyam) and going to a guru for studying (mumukshutvam). Or Yamadharmaraja tempting Naciketas to choose between sreyas and preyas. Kathopanishad 1.1.25 Samadi shatka sampatti is emphasized in Brhadaranyaka.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we are lacking the qualification vedanta becomes an academic time-pass.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve got a lot of time and want some intellectual gymnastic … It will be more information than transformation of the person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I have to grasp Vedanta like Naciketas, I should be after moksha like him and throw away dharma/artha/kama. Dropping them like kaka vistha - crow droppings. We just immediately wipe them out and don’t claim it is a great achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just like purushasuktam occurs in RG veda, yajurveda, samaveda so brhadaranyaka has two versions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purva pakshi: The very word purva mimamsa indicates that it should come first (before uttara mimamsa). Thus you should translate “atha” as purva mimamsa anantaram. Shankaracarya refutes that after purva mimamsa alone one should come to uttarama mimasa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1) vyabicara dosha (lack of consistency). &lt;strong&gt;Even after a thorough study of purva mimamsa a person might not have sadhana catustaya sampatti.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus unqualified person might enter Vedanta, esp. thinking that after purva uttara should come automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-14--14830&quot;&gt;Class 14 / 14830&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are rare &lt;strong&gt;cases where person is born with sadhana catustaya sampati in a reasonable measure. They do not require purva mimamsa, why should they waste time with rituals?&lt;/strong&gt; Thus sadhana catustaya sampati is compulsory for all, not karma khaNDa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Shankaracarya’s time there was the idea prevalent that pure knowledge cannot give moksha. That jnana must be combined karma - jnana karma samudcayena (combination) mokshah by jnana karma samudcaya vadi. Thus Sankaracarya gives 3 more reasons:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;karma khanda jnana khanda vishaya bheda. The subject matter of these two is diagonally opposite, therefore cannot be combined.&lt;/strong&gt; Combination is possible only when subjects are similar. But: sadhyam vs. siddham. Anamta vs atma. Extroverted dependence on the world vs introverted self-dependence. anitya phalam vs nitya phalam. Full of sangha vs neti neti. Avidya vs vidya. Preyas vs sreyas …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3) prajoyana bheda - benefit is also different. Anitya phalam which falls within samsara, vs anitya phalam which is moksha. &lt;strong&gt;South is presided by Yamadharmaraja who has kala (mrtyu) in his hand. North is presided by Soma Devata with amruta in hand.&lt;/strong&gt; Karmakhanda is going southwards, jnanakhanda is going northwards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4) pravrti bheda - functional difference. &lt;strong&gt;karmakanda always incites a person into action, achievement oriented.&lt;/strong&gt; First tempts for phalam and then gives the ritual to achieve it. &lt;strong&gt;Jnanakanda&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t tempt by providing various goals, it says &lt;strong&gt;whatever you want to accomplish is your very nature. In you, brahmananda, all others anandas are included. The one who has discovered brahman has accomplished everything in life. Having known that I’m that purnah (and akarta) what temptation will he have? It makes a person so contented that he doesn’t want to accomplish anything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scriptural refutation of purva paksi’s view: Sankaracarya wants to establish that karmakhanda and jnanakhanda are not in krama (sequence). So he says there is no vedic reference for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If many rituals have to be done simultaneously they have to be done by many people since one person can do only one at a time. &lt;strong&gt;Thus simultaneity requires many performers.&lt;/strong&gt; Whereas where many rituals have to be done by one persons they will have to be done one after the other. &lt;strong&gt;Ekakartatvam is the condition for krama&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three conditions (any of these) indicates ekakartrtatvam:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;eka pradhana sheshatvam - if many rituals are subsidiary (part) to one main ritual, which one person wants to perform. Example washing the hands and eating the food.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sheshasheshitvam - one main, one subsidiary ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhikrta adhikaratvam - two main rituals. A person is qualified if he has done one rituals he becomes qualified to do the other.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-15--14831&quot;&gt;Class 15 / 14831&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gist of the previous technical discussion: there is no veda pramanam to prove that purva mimamsa is compulsory for the study of vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brhadaranyaka 4.4.22: &lt;em&gt;That great, birthless Self which is identified with the intellect and is in the midst of the organs, lies in the ether that is within the heart. It is the controller of all, the lord of all, the ruler of all. It does not become better through good work nor worse through bad work. It is the Lord of all, It is the ruler of all beings, It is the protector of all beings. It is the bank that serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds apart. The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas, sacrifices, charity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects. Knowing It alone one becomes a sage. Desiring this world (the Self) alone, monks renounce their homes . This is (the reason for it); The ancient sages, it is said, did not desire children ( thinking ), “What shall we achieve through children, we who have attained this Self, this world ( result ). “They, it is said , renounced their desire for progeny, for wealth and for the worlds, and lived a mendicant life. That which is the desire for progeny is the desire for wealth, and that which is the desire for wealth is the desire for the worlds, for both these are but desires. This self is That which has been described as “Not this, not this”. It is imperceptible, for It is never perceived; undecaying, for It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered — It never feels pain, and never suffers injury. (It is but proper) that the sage is never overtaken by these two thoughts, “I did an evil act for this” , and “I did a good act for this”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If purva mimamsa is not compulsory then what is compulsory? Sadhana catustaya smapatti. It doesn’t matter in which janma it was acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thus &lt;strong&gt;“atha” here directly means “sadhana catustaya sampati anantaram”, indirectly “adhikari”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;atah shabda vicara: atah - therefore.&lt;/strong&gt; The word “therefore” indicates that there  must be some reason for brahman enquiry to be conducted. Sankaracarya gives two reasons:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;karma cannot give moksha.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;jnanam alone gives moksha&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sruti pramanam, see e.g.: Kaivalya Upanishad. Yukti: samsara nivrti can happen only through jnanam, because samsara is superimposed. How do you destroy rope-snake? Samsara is adhyasa because of atma-anatma aviveka there is jivatmabuddhi, paricheda buddhi, I’m husband etc. Anubhava: any superimposed problem, like rope-snake, can go only by knowledge. Sruti: Mandukya: 2 - K - 32&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indirectly “atah” signifies prayojanam. Atah shabda vicara is over.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;brahmajijnasa. Final meaning is “brahman enquiry”&lt;/strong&gt;. There are three parts: brahma, jijna, sa.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“brahma” here means saytam jnanam anantam brahman jagat karanam based on the 2nd sutra.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“jijna” here means jnanam. vrdha aparoksha jnanam of brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“sa” - direct meaning: iccha, desire. &lt;strong&gt;In sanskrit “sa” pratyaya conveys the meaning of desire&lt;/strong&gt; (desiderative usage). Indirect meaning (lakshyartha), which is to be taken here is “enquiry”.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-enquiry should not be understood as independent enquiry, but with the help of guru and sastra. Vedanta alone is the pramanam for brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-16--14832&quot;&gt;Class 16 / 14832&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahmajnana iccha =  brahmajnana vedanta vicara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Q: Why do you introduce Vedanta here? A: Any knowledge can be obtained only by the operation of appropriate pramanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mere enquiry, mere independent thinking, mere sitting in meditation are not accepted as one of the six pramanams.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a person goes into enquiring into brahman without using any pramanam, it will lead only to speculation, hypothesis. Never to knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; Here only upnishad shabda pramanam is the pramanam, as Vyasa says in the 3rd sutra.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any adhyasa is removed by ts adhisthana jnanam.&lt;/strong&gt; yatra yatra adhyastattvam tatra tatra sva adhisthana jnanam nirvartyatvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Atma is adhisthanam of samsara. Purvapakshi: we should be conducting atma jijnasa, how com Vyasa writes brahman? Brahman is the same as atman. See Taittriya 3 - 1 - 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brahman is not a new substance to be revealed by the scriptures.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the biggest mistake a seeker commits. &lt;strong&gt;It is a new status of the already available substance called aham.&lt;/strong&gt; My para prakrti. Now I’m lost in apara prakrti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Old vs. new status: jeevatam/abrahmatvam vs. brahmatvam, samsaritvam vs. mokshatvam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4th word supplied by us &lt;strong&gt;“kartavyah” - should be done. It should be understood as srotavyah, mantavyah, niddidhyasitavyah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-tavyah indicates imperative mood in sanskrit grammar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final meaning: sadhana catustaya sampatti anantram brahmajnanaya vedanta sravana manana niddidhiasanani kartavyani yasmat brahma jnanaya eva moksha, na tu karmanah. After acquiring the four-fold qualification one should do sravana, manana, niddidhiasanam for the sake of brahmajnanam because it alone gives moksha, not karma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What to do depends on the status of the student. There is no universal advise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example illumination: wire connection (sadhana catustaya sampatti) + fixing the bulb (vedanta).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical format used in sutra literature. 5 stages for each adhikaranam (topic):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhikaranam: jijnasa adhikaranam&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;viSaya (subject matter, domain): vedanta sastram&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;vizayah (samshayah, doubt): should we study or not? Purva pakshi: it is not worth studying, it doesn’t have anubandha catustyam, unlike darma-/tarkasastram.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;siddhantah (our conclusion): adhikaris are there but don’t say not there, see BG 7 / 3. Brahman is there because it is yourself. Many have attained moksha, therefore there is prayojanam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sangatih (connection of this topic with the previous topic): not there. Only the later sutras will have.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purvapakshi - anybody opposed to us vedantins, e.g. sankhya philosopher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-17--14833---2nd-sutra-janmadasya-yatah&quot;&gt;Class 17 / 14833 - 2nd sutra: janmadasya yatah&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd sutra is the beginning of the sastram. Just like in Gita.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd sutra is in the 2nd adhikaranam again with one sutra only. Janmadhi adhikaranam. Topic is brahma lakshanam - definition of brahman. Therefore this sutra is called &lt;strong&gt;brahmalaksanasutram.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any object is established only through lakshanam and pramanam.&lt;/strong&gt; Only if it is established, siddham, only then you can make further enquiry about it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analysis presupposes siddhi, the existence or the knowledge of the vastu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman is not unknown. It is known through veda pramana. The very word brahman indicates the existence of an entity. The very word tells me it is big - infinitely. Bhr-dhatu indicates expansion or bigness. Here it is not adjective but noun, thus it is the bigness it self.  Since there is no other word to condition the “big” it is unconditionally big, infinite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In scriptures, adjectives are converted to noun to indicate absolute not relative.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yet I’ve experienced only limited, time and space bound objects thus to remove the doubt of its existence the sastra tells me it is “I” myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doubting existence of Brahman is doubting self existence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doubter cannot be doubted. Nobody says “I’m not there”. Therefore there is no doubt regarding self existence, which is the same brahman existence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purvapakshi: if brahman is already known, why make enquiry? Who am I is not clear… I don’t have a clear knowledge of myself, because different philosophers have different contentions.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Carvaka: I’m the body, mind is not a substance but electrical phenomenon of the brain. Fused brain means the fellow is dead.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Buddhist: mind is atma.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Naiyayika: body and mind are not atma. There is a self beyond these. That atmas are many, each individual has one, so that we don’t have quarrel. Example: soccer match. 22 people fighting for a ball. Just give a ball to everybody and there is no fight. Each atma is infinite atma, karta and bhokta.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sankhya and Yoga philosopher: many atmas, all are all-pervading. But atmas are not karta, only bhokta. Body and mind do action, the atma enjoys.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vedanta: &lt;strong&gt;atma ekah, sarvagatah, akarta, abhokta. Regarding atma there are so many confusions thus enquiry is required. Because brahman is neither completely known nor unknown, but vaguely/unclearly known.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lakshanam (definition) is of two types:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;svarupa&lt;/strong&gt; - object is defined through its intrinsic feature. Examples: Awareness. Moon’s brightness is always experienced when you see it thus it is its intrinsic feature. &lt;strong&gt;It is that intrinsic feature which reveals or define an object.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tatastha&lt;/strong&gt; (that which remains on the bank of the river; aloof; away) - object defined through its incidental, temporary feature not intrinsic to the object. Examples: Jagat karanam brahman. The house with a crow sitting on it among several same looking ones. &lt;strong&gt;vyavartakam - that which specifies, pinpoints.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tatah - bank of a river&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sthaha - remaining&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd sutra is presenting the tatastha lakshanam of brahman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Context helps in adhyahara (inference). Here: &lt;strong&gt;janmadasya yatah&lt;/strong&gt; (tat brahma bavati) - brahman is that from which the origin, sustenance, resolution of the world takes place. In simple sanskrit: jagat sristhi sthiti laya karanam brahma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-18--14834&quot;&gt;Class 18 / 14834&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;janmadhi - sristhi stithi layah (bangam)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;asya - of this&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;yatah - cosmos / universe / world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final meaning: “brahman is that cause from which cause the origin etc. of the universe takes place.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once we prove the existence of brahman through lakshanam thereafter we can talk about enquiry into brahman. Brahma vicara (1st sutra talks about) is impossible without brahma siddhi (2nd sutra talks about).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In BS no idea is Vyasa’s, he’s only analysing upanishads’ sutras. Here he’s got Taittriya 3 - 1 - 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;janmadhi = janma (birth) + adhi (etc.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Objection 1: Every objects in the creation goes through janmadi shatkam (in book called nirukta by Yaska). Therefore purva puskhi suggests it should be interpreted as janmadi shatkam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Niruktam - science of etymology. See mundaka 1 - 1 - 5. &lt;strong&gt;Yaska cannot talk about the origin of akasha, vayu … because he himself came later. Therefore his discussion is confined to bhautika prapanca, i.e. objects within the creation like a tree, wall etc.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore since the context is bhutabautika prapanca his discussion is irrelevant in the discussion of jagat karanam brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer 1: All smrti grantas are purusheya grantas but enjoying apaurusheya status because they are based on shruti paranam. Thus Shankara’s comment based  on sruti vakyam has original validity, Yaska’s vakyam has borrowed validity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer 2: Purpose of BS is analysis of vedanta vakyani. Thus the very name indicates the stated purpose. Yaska’s statement is from nirukta, not vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Objection 2: You say that sristhi stithi laya are a cyclic process. Thus you cannot say which one is the beginning. But the word adhi in Sanskrit literally means “beginning with”. Etcetera is only secondary meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer 1: Talking about any object in creation presupposes the destruction. Only existing thing can have destruction. Existence presupposes the origin of a thing. &lt;strong&gt;Born (sristi) is (stiti) gone (laya)&lt;/strong&gt; Thus you’d only say janma adhi.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer 2: Vyasa is writing a sutra keeping sruti vyakyam in the mind. When using these three words, shruti starts with janma. So does Gita.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;asya - “of this”. Vyasa has not specified any specific noun so you should include all the existing nouns. He uses “this” and not “that”. According to grammar “this” is for something that is accessible in front. Final meaning &lt;strong&gt;asya - of this&lt;/strong&gt; pratyaksha prapanca.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;yatah - yasmAt karanat - from which all these take place.&lt;/strong&gt; Karanam is two fold: nimitta and upadana. The maker and the material. Both are required for any karyam to take place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since we’re referring to sristhi sthiti and laya the word karanam must refer to upadana karanam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-19--14835&quot;&gt;Class 19 / 14835&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normally nimitta karana is responsible only for creation, nor for maintenance and destruction. Therefore intelligent cause is defined as sristhi matra karanam. Material cause is defined as sristhi, sthithi, laya karanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;janmadhi refers to sristhi, sthithi, laya, therefore yatah refers to sristhi, sthiti, laya karanam and therefore primarily it conveys upadana karanam, since there is no separate nimitta karanam we have to include nimitta karana.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we are talking about the cause which is beyond desha kala, that karanam should be ekam eva advitiyam. If it has to be one, then we can say it should itself serve as upadana karanam and as there is no second thing also as nimitta karanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final meaning of the word &lt;strong&gt;yatah:&lt;/strong&gt; from which material and intelligent cause the world has sristhi sthitit layam, that abinna &lt;strong&gt;nimita upadana karanam&lt;/strong&gt; is brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ananda is svarupam lakshanam of brahman, jagat karanatvam is tatastha of brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore “&lt;strong&gt;yatah” further means “ananda svarupam”.&lt;/strong&gt; It reveals both, tatastha and svarupa lakshanam of brahman. Primarily tatastha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We supplied two more words: tat brahman. Shankara adds one more feature: &lt;strong&gt;once we know the intelligent cause the amount of intelligence can be inferred from the nature of the product.&lt;/strong&gt; As the product is so must be the producer or his intelligence. &lt;strong&gt;If you see the nature of the world, its greatness, wonders, vibhuti then you can definitively conclude that Isvara is sarvajnah and sarvashaktiman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When brahman is seen as the karanam he gets the name Isvara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adjectives describing Ishvara’s glory:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;intelligent creator: &lt;strong&gt;Well designed universe, not accidental one. It can’t be explained as simple evolution by accident.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have to design a simple clock, so much intelligence is required. How can you say the universe is accidental? &lt;strong&gt;Chetana karta - intelligent being is required.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jivabinna: This universe consists of countless jivas who are kartas and bhotkas, having countless experiences&lt;/strong&gt;, imagine the amount of knowledge required to run this master show. Infinite intelligence - sarvajnatvam - is required. &lt;strong&gt;By this Shankara indicates that jivas themselves fall within the creation as products and therefore the creator must be a non-jiva. He must be omniscient. Ghatasya karta ghatajnahah. Sarvasyakarta sarvajnah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;wonderful universe: &lt;strong&gt;We find there is no accidents in the creation. Every event is an incident cause by specific time (kala), place (desha) and reason (nimitta). That’s why the world is a cosmos, not a chaos.&lt;/strong&gt; There are certain events that need to be designed so that one and the same event gives punya phalam of one jiva and a papa phalam of another jiva.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;omnipotence: A scientist can know how the brain functions, but he cannot create a brain. We might have the knowledge of function, but not the power to create it. **Ishvara has omnipotence to implement the knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we call accident is an incident for which we do not know the reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bhagavan implements many things which are inconceivable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full definition of brahman: yasmat abinna nimitta upadana karanat ananda svarupat sarvajnat sarvashaktat prapancasya sristhi sthiti laya sambhavanti tat brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nayayika: 2nd sutra gives pramanam for brahman also. It defines brahman or Isvara as jagat karanam -&amp;gt; world is karyam of Isvara. Invisible Isvara can be inferred from the visible karya prapanca. Like the invisible father can be inferred from the visible solid son who’s in front of me. Thus anumanam is the pramanam for Isvara, popularly known in tarka sastra as karya lingaka anumanam. Thus nayayika’s conclusion is sastra is not required for proving Isvara, logic itself will do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedantin: no. &lt;strong&gt;Isvara cannot be established through pure logic, without the help of sastra.&lt;/strong&gt; Sastra is primary, tarka or anumanam is secondary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-20--14836&quot;&gt;Class 20 / 14836&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without a specifying definition and without a revealing pramanam a thing cannot be established.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: if the 2nd sutra is providing anumana pramanam for Isvara, these BS cannot be called vedanta sutras at all. Shankara doesn’t propound a philosophy by using his reasoning power. He is using reasoning to understand the vedic teaching and derive a systematic philosophy out of the vedanta. If you say 2nd sutra is providing anumana pramanam for Isvara, then the importance will go to anumanam and it will not be a sastra based system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BS - garland of vedanta darshanam. Flowers are vedanta vakyas. Tarka just as the invisible thread, is only hiding behind the flowers just to keep them in orderly form.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus 2nd sutram is not independent anumanam, but to analyze vedanta vakyas. Lakshana sutra, not pramana sutra.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sub-commentators: Nayayikas believe that Isvara can be logically established. Vedantins: &lt;strong&gt;Isvara can be established through shastra alone, not through logic. Isvara can be assimilated through logic.&lt;/strong&gt; Logic serves as the funnel for the Isvara which is coming from the sastra bottle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nayayika arrives at Isvara through three logical statements:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;jagat sakartrkam karyatvat ghatavat - world must have a creator, because it is a product. Just like a pot. Vyapti (generalization): yat yat karyam tat tat sakatrkam - whatever is product must have a creator.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;jagat karta isvarah jivabinnatvethih cetanatvat. Example: vyatirekena kulalavat (unlike a pot-maker). The creator must be Isvara alone, because I know there is a creator and I also know that no jiva has created this world. Whatever is conscious being other than jiva, it must be Isvara.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;isvarah sarvajnah sarvakarttvat vyatirekena kulavat. Ishvara has to be omniscient who is creator of everything unlike a pot maker who is only gatajnah (alpajnah). Yatra sarvakarttvam tatra sarvajnatvam abibhavati yoyat karta tatajnah.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So we don’t need veda but pure logic to establish Isvara. Which makes modern day scientists happy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedantins: all three reasons are faulty. You can sell this reasons to not logical people but not to vedantin, he’s more logical than nayayaika. Counter argumentation:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Anumanam requires vyaptijnanam. Vyapti is gathered from pratyaksham (observation) alone. &lt;strong&gt;A vyapti arrived at through observation will be acceptable if there is no vyabicara (exception)&lt;/strong&gt;. Wherever there is smoke, there is fire is accepted because there is no exception. Turned around the statement will not hold true. &lt;strong&gt;Only in the case of artificial product you’re able to prove a creator through perception.&lt;/strong&gt; For any natural product, e.g. tree (product) in amazon jungle, you cannot prove a creator through perception.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vyapti: wherever a conscious being is involved other than jiva, it must be Isvara only. Thus in your vyapti you’re talking about a conscious being other than jiva. &lt;strong&gt;Vyapti has to be always proved through perception - how can talk about a conscious being other than jiva proved through perception?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Isvara is creator because he’s creator of everything. &lt;strong&gt;Nayayika’s axiom, as he depends on perception and inference heavily: every knowledge is born out of mind&lt;/strong&gt; - yat jnanam tat manojanyam. This contradicts &lt;strong&gt;another statement he’s made is Isvara doesn’t have mind&lt;/strong&gt;, as he’s asamsari.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If sastram is not there, every system of philosophy will have wonderful statements when it is taken in an isolated matter. All logically will have a very big problem if you want to tie all the statements together and consistent.&lt;/strong&gt; Even modern science will be full of fallacies if you try to tie up the matter, the consciousness, the creation. Science is wonderful because it doesn’t want to analyse consciousness. &lt;strong&gt;Science is allergic to consciousness.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore each system of science is trying to take away from itself. Psychologist are not able to explain so they give it on to neurologist. Neuroscientist are not able to explain therefore they give it to quantum physics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-21--14837&quot;&gt;Class 21 / 14837&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isvara cannot be established by anumanam. &lt;strong&gt;Isvara established purely by anumanam can be negated by anumanam.&lt;/strong&gt; This is what the sub-commentators have done (in purnanandiya vyakyanam), to prove that Isvara cannot be logically established.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once the topic of truth, once the topic of God comes, never rely on logic.&lt;/strong&gt; Yet tarka is very important for understanding Vedanta. Use tarka as a subservient means in understanding Vedanta. &lt;strong&gt;Use it as a funnel to pour vedantic teaching.&lt;/strong&gt; Logic blessed by shruti alone is accepted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dustarka - independent tarka without the support of sruti. Never do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In karma khandam tarka is not very important. It has got a limited role alone.&lt;/strong&gt; In karma khanda performance or procedures of doing are important. In karmakhanda knowledge doesn’t produce the result.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Misconception of many people: I learn the procedure and thereafter I have to follow the procedure and one day moksha will be produced. Shankara: Vedanta doesn’t deal with a future event to be created or processed. &lt;strong&gt;We are not learning any procedure, technique, method through Vedanta&lt;/strong&gt;. We don’t want to implement anything after Vedantic study. Vedanta is dealing with the accomplished fact of moksha. &lt;strong&gt;Whole vedantic sadhana is a process of understanding, there is nothing to implement after understanding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Vedanta understanding is an end in itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatever obstructs understanding should be knocked off and one of the main obstructions comes from intellect in the form of samshaya (doubt). Therefore &lt;strong&gt;tarka or mananam is very important, to remove the intellectual obstacles.&lt;/strong&gt; Tarka serves as a broomsticks when the vedantic teaching is entering the head.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The whole vedantic struggle is the clear vision of the teaching. Sruti, yukti and anubhava are all important. Our samsara is in the form of mental anubhava: lack of peace, inadequacy, smallness… Therefore &lt;strong&gt;the understanding is complete, when the samsara bhava goes away.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore the benefit, as opposed to karma khanda, is here and now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two extremes. One is nayayika, he gives too much importance to tarka and sruti is not given its place. In purva mimamsaka sruti is important tarka is rejected. In vedanta surti is given importance, yukti also is given importance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conclusion of 2nd sutra:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;adhikaranam: janmadhi adhikaranam&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;viSaya: brahma lakshanam&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;vizayah: Asti va nasti va? Purva pakshi: no definition. Definition is given through the unique feature of the object. How can featureless brahman have an unique feature? Even though brahman is really featureless we can define brahman trhough superimposed features, through mithya features. Through the superimposed feature of snake I can define rope as the adhisthanam. Similarly, &lt;strong&gt;through the superimposed jagat brahman can defined as jagat karanam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;siddhanta: asti&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;connection (akshepa sangatih): we prove the existence of brahman by giving the lakshanam.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-22--14838&quot;&gt;Class 22 / 14838&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd sutra is the foundation sutra of the entire vedanta sastram.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Svarupa lakshanam: defining through intrinsic, innate features. satyam jananam anantam brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tatastha lakshanam: indirect definition through some extraneous feature which is not internal part. Jagat karanam brahman. Jagat adhisthanam brahman. Brahman is revealed through jagat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why did Vyasa choose tatastha do define brahman? &lt;strong&gt;In the case of brahman, at least initially, tatastha lakshanam is easier to understand than svarupa lakshanam.&lt;/strong&gt; In tatastha we’re taking the external features which are clearly visible. &lt;strong&gt;Through the known to the unknown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satyam is not visible, jnanam is not experiencable, anantam is not known to me.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore svarupa lakshanam will be useful after using tatasta lakshanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the upanishad sometimes brahman is presented as the material cause of the universe. But sometimes maya or prakrti is the material cause (e.g. svetaasvatara upanishad 4  / 5, 10). BG 13 says: prakrti and purusha are two beginningless principles and creation has come out of prakrti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cetana brahma karanatvam uktam na tu acetana prakrti karanatvam. Why did Vyasa choose cetana brahman as material cause?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Vyasa wants to clearly differentiate vedantic teaching from sankhya philosophy.&lt;/strong&gt; In most of BS Vyasa wants to separate himself from Sankhya - main opponent. Sankhya is very close to Vedanta.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Purusha and Prakrti are commons word in both but definition is different.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The very word Sankhya is used to indicate vedantic teaching. BG Chapter 2 - title is “Sankhya yoga”. They might appear to be the same but Vyasa wants to show they are different. &lt;strong&gt;Sankhya says prakrti is the material cause of the universe. Vyasa to differentiate says brahman is the material cause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2) In all of the systems of philosophy one of the &lt;strong&gt;basic questions is about the material origin of the universe.&lt;/strong&gt; Even in science: unified theory - TOE - theory of everything. They want to arrive at one basic stuff for matter. Even energy they are not able to accept because the energies are many. &lt;strong&gt;Most of the philosophies arrive at a basic material cause and you find all of them are acetana material cause.&lt;/strong&gt; Material cause is the matter.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For Sankhya and Yoga it is the acetana prakrtih. Consciousness is a parallel reality.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Nyaya and Vaysheshika: basic material cause is atom - paramanu vada. Very close to our science. And paramanu is acetanam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Skandas in Buddhism, astikaya in Jainism … acetana karana vada.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Modern science assumes matter alone as fundamental.  According to Big Bang theory life, thus consciousness, is of very recent origin. And consciousness has originated from matter. &lt;strong&gt;Acetana karana vada.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Nyaya Vaisheshika: 9 types of matter - like elements and one of these is atma. Consciousness comes and goes in the atma.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uniqueness of Vedanta teaching is cetana karana vada, where the spirit excels matter. Consciousness is&lt;/strong&gt; not equal to matter, not subservient to matter, but &lt;strong&gt;superior to matter. The fundamental substance, basic stuff, basic content.&lt;/strong&gt; If you crush the universe (stone, mike, taperecorder) in a mixie, the sarah will be caitanyam, in other philosophies matter. &lt;strong&gt;Matter crushed is caitanyam, caitanyam diluted is matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3) In the upanishads brahman alone is predominantly shown as the material cause, only in few places prakrti is presented as the material cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4) Both cetana brahman and acetana prakrti as presented as material cause. Is this not contradictory? If one is correct, the other must be wrong.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Both statements are correct. Purusha is upadana karanam is correct. Prakrti is upadana karanam is also correct.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;According to the upanishads &lt;strong&gt;prarkti does not exist independent of purusha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since maya is nonseparate from brahman, whatever is attributed to maya, can be attributed to brahman also. Saying prakrti is the karanam is as good as saying brahman is the karanam.&lt;/strong&gt; Prakrti is based on brahman. Prakrti borrows the very existence from brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Vedanta prakrti is parinami upadana karanam, brahman is vivarta upadana karanam - that which lends existence to parinami upadana karanam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Sankhya philosophy prakrti is independent of purusha.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the basic difference between Sankhya and Vedanta. Therefore prakrti’s actions cannot be attributed to purusha.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brahman lends existence to prakrti and through prakrti it lends existence to whole creation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;eka vijnaneya sarva vijnanam - by knowing one, one can know everything else&lt;/strong&gt;. See Mundaka I - I - 3. Upadana karanena vijnanena sarva karya vijnanam bhavati - by knowing one material cause, all products are known. Because products do not exists separate from the material cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-23--14839---3rd-sutra-sastrayonitvat&quot;&gt;Class 23 / 14839 - 3rd sutra: sastrayonitvat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uniqueness of Vedanta is that it presents consciousness as the very material cause of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Sankhya prakrti and purusha are totally different. You cannot interchange them. &lt;strong&gt;In Vedanta prakrti and purusha can be interchanged because ultimately there is no prakrti separate from purusha.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus prakrti karana vada is as good as brahman karana vada.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ekajnah sarvajnah bhavati is impossible in Sankhya because prakrti is the karanam and prapanca is the karyam. In Sankhya philosphy eka karana prakrti vijnanena karya prapanca vijnanam bhavati brahma vijnanam naiva bhavati, because purusha is neither karanam nor karyam in Sankhya philosphy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3rd sutra: &lt;strong&gt;sastrayonitvat&lt;/strong&gt;. Also happens to be one adhikaranam: satra yoni.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This sutra is an example for visvatomukatvam - having many faces / facets / interpretations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This sutra confirms the omniscience of brahman&lt;/strong&gt; which is indirectly revealed in the 2nd sutra. brahma sarvajnatvam drdhayati.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd sutra - brahman is sarva karanam. From this direct meaning we can derive an indirect meaning. Ghatasya karta, gatajnah -&amp;gt; sarvasya karta, sarvajnah. &lt;strong&gt;Karta means one with jnanam.&lt;/strong&gt; Brahman is nimitta karanam of verything - omniscient. &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge always belongs to the nimitta karanam, karta&lt;/strong&gt;. This indirectly expressed omniscient is confirmed in the 3rd sutra by pointing out that brahman is the creator of vedas also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sastrayoni = vedakarta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd sutra - brahman is nimitta karanam of artha prapancha (objective universe), in 3rd sutra of shabda prapanca (veda shabdanam abhikarta).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankaracarya: Veda contains all knowledge. There is no branch of science which is not in the Veda. Veda consists of para vidya as well as apara vidya. &lt;strong&gt;Veda itself is considered sarvajnah&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedas which are available now are only an insignificant portion. Much of the Vedas is lost in time. &lt;strong&gt;Samaveda had 1000 branches. Now only 2 or 3 are left.&lt;/strong&gt; Even since Shankaracarya lived (~ 1200 years ago) many of his quotations we can’t find in the current Vedas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vypati: &lt;strong&gt;The author of a work always know more than is content of the work.&lt;/strong&gt; You can never express everything that you know in verbal form. Expressed portion &amp;lt; known portion - yah yasya grantasya karta sah tatah adhikajnanavan. Brahma sarvajnam veda karttvat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is accepted Vedas are anadi, apaurusheyam. Not created by anyone. So how can you say brahman has created them? &lt;strong&gt;It does not mean brahman intellectually invented the Vedas. Vedah is creation of no intellect. This vedic teaching was already there in potential form. Brahman only brought this teaching to manifestation.&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly like the creation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job of brahman is not producing the world, but only manifesting.&lt;/strong&gt; Same for veda sastram. It was not created by him, it is anadi, in him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nyaya: bhagavan creates vedas. Vedanta: bhagavan manifested already existent Vedas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3d sutra is based on Brhadaranyaka 2 - 4 - 10 (maitreyi brahmanam). Examples:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sristhi: agni (smoke coming out of fire w. wet fuel)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sthiti: dundubi (drum beat)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;laya: samudra (all rivers merge into ocean)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In all others sristhi statements in upanishads the brahman is said to be creator of the world. Here also of the vedas. &lt;strong&gt;Creation (manifestation) of the universe and the Vedas is like breathing for brahman. Effortless, not even aware.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Word analysis: sastram + yoni. Sastra means entire Vedah (purva and anta bhaga). &lt;strong&gt;shatanat (commandment, teaching) trayate (protects) iti sastram.&lt;/strong&gt; In purva bhaga we get commandments and punishments.  In veda antah bhaga there are no commandments, only revelation of the fact - &lt;strong&gt;you’re already free, brahman. You need not work for one thing. Moksha. For all other things you need to work.&lt;/strong&gt; Through commanding and teaching Vedah protects from samsara. yoni (in this context): nimitta karanam, karta, author.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 factors:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;viSaya: brahman&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;samshaya: brahman vedasya karta va na va?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;purva paksha: na vedasya karta. Why? vedasya anaditvat, vedasya nityatvat, it need not be created at all. What is created is anityam. If veda is nityam, how can it be said to be created?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;siddhanta: Veda is anadi, yet &lt;strong&gt;we talk about the beginning because it has got a state of manifestation and unmanifestation exactly like the world.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why say the &lt;strong&gt;whole Veda in unmanifested state is omkara&lt;/strong&gt;. Taitriya 1 - 4 - 1: by churning the vedas brahjami took the butter, the essence - omkara. &lt;strong&gt;Shabda is akasha guna (property), veda was in akasha and that akaksha was in brahman. akasha is brahman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sangatih: akshepa sangatih - this adhikaranam answers an object raised based on the previous adhikaranam. In the previous adhikaranam brahman is said to be sarvakaranam. Based on that objection is raised: sarvakaranam but the vedas.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saram: brahman’s omniscience is reinforced by way of negating the objection raised by purva mimamsaka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-24--14840&quot;&gt;Class 24 / 14840&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;brahman is omniscient because he’s the author of the vedas. Veda deals with all the topics under the sun, thus is as good as sarvajnam. And the author must know even much more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vyasa doesn’t accept anumanam as pramanam for brahman. Veda clearly says brahman cannot be known through tarka (Kathopanishad 1 - 2 - 9), i.e. logic, inference. Veda sastram alone is pramanam for brahman. This is conveyed through the 3d sutra.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sastrayonitvat means sastravishayatvat. &lt;strong&gt;Brahman cannot be the subject matter of logic, it is the subject matter of Vedanta alone.&lt;/strong&gt; It is beyond logic. Like punya. Punya is also subject matter of sastra alone. That’s why it is called adrstha vishayah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1st interpretation. Sastrayoni - author of the vedas. Vishaya vakyam - sruti statement, based on which this topic is discussed: Brhandaranyaka 2 - 4 - 10.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd interpretation. Sastrayoni - subject matter of the vedas. Vishaya vakyam: Brhadaranyaka 3 - 9 - 26: tam tu aupanishadam purusham priccami. Part of the debate between Yagnavalkya and Shakalya. Yagnavalkya asks about nirguna brahman (purusha). He uses the adjective &lt;strong&gt;aupanishadam - upanishadam eka vedyam&lt;/strong&gt; - that which can be known only through upanishads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shakala lost his head. It burst - his ego was deflated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd meaning of yoni - pramanam, 1st was karta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grammatical difference: Poet and king example (lokanatah). Master of the world vs. one for whom the world is the master.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1st interpretation is tatpurusha samasa: sastrasya karta&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2nd interpretation is bahuvrihi samasa: sastram yonih pramanam yasya (sastra is the means of knowledge). Brahman is that for which sastram is the pramanam. Therefore it is not available for anumanam.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 factor presentation of adhikaranam:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;viSaya: cetana jagat karanam brahman&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;samshaya: doubt &lt;strong&gt;(always remember pendulum). It will always have two or more opinions.&lt;/strong&gt; anumana vedyam va na va. Is brahman knowable through anumanam or not? Logic means science. Thus &lt;strong&gt;can consciousness be studied by any material science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;purva pakshi: brahman is within the scope of science because it is the cause of the universe, just like clay which is the cause of pot.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;siddanta (always Vyasa): brahman can be known through sastra alone. Like dharma. Definition of Veda by Sayanacarya: Veda is that which gives the knowledge of such a subject matter, which is not available for any other means of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sangatih: connection between 2nd and 3rd sutra. eka palatatva sangatih. Both adhikaranam have a common goal, phalam, which is brahma siddhi. First Vaysa has to establish brahman (brahma siddhi), only then one can enquire into that brahman - 1st sutra (one should enquire into brahman).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If one has not the definition of moon, he will not be able to say what whether there is moon or not even if he sees the moon. He’s got the pramanam but not laskaham. If lakshanam is there but not pramanam (blind person), you also cannot talk about the moon. Brahma siddhi: lakshanam (2nd sutra) + pramanam (3rd sutra)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman has to be enquired into, that brahman is the cause of the universe and brahman can be enquired into through vedanta pramana alone. Therefore do vedanta vicara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shantimantra: Because brahman is not available for science let me not reject brahman, let me accept the sastra and through it let me know brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-25--14841---4th-sutra-tattu-samanvayat&quot;&gt;Class 25 / 14841 - 4th sutra: tattu samanvayat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;brahman is nimitta + upadana karanam knowable through shastra pramanam not available for any other means of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4th sutra, which is also the entire 4th adhikaranam: &lt;strong&gt;tattu samanvayat&lt;/strong&gt;. Name of the adhikaranam: samanvayadhikaranam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General analysis: this is the &lt;strong&gt;key sutra based on which entire 1st chapter&lt;/strong&gt; (134 sutras in total) of BS is developed. The following 130 sutras are elaboration of this sutra alone. Based on this sutra 1st chapter is called samanvayAdhyAya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd sutra is the foundation of entire BS&lt;/strong&gt; (Chapters 1 -4).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the two meanings of 3rd sutra: sastra vishayatvat - brahman is the central theme of vedanta shastram. How do we know this is the central theme?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A sastram can have only one central theme. If there are more it is a defect - vakya bheda dosha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Author is not around to clarify what is the central theme, hence contradiction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;samanvaya - condition to prove what is the central teaching, consistency&lt;/strong&gt;, importance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whichever team has six factors of proof - shad lingyani, that team enjoys importance, thus becomes the central theme. Vyasa: brahman is the central theme of vedanta sastram, because it enjoys importance, consistency, harmony. &lt;strong&gt;brahman is vedanta sastra vishaya (central theme) because it enjoys importance just like dharma in purva bhaga of the veda.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous three sutras had concrete upanishad vakyani as vishaya vakyani. 4th sutra has the entire vedanta sastram as vishaya vakyam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Word analysis: tat - tu - samvayat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tat - that. It stands for the noun which has been discussed in the previous three sutras: brahman. Thus tat stands for: vicaryam jagat karanam veda kartr sarvajnam sarvashakti brahman sastra vishayah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;anuvrtti method - pulling words from previous sentences to save words. Example: Rama went to temple. Krishna also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;samanvayat - because brahman enjoys consistency, importance. It is proved by six lingas:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upakrama upasamharau - identity, oneness of the beginning and the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;abhyasa - repetition.&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever is repeated, is the central theme. You repeat something for stress or emphasis.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;apUrvata - whatever enjoys “newness”, is a new topic.&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever is newly thought must be important, not what is already known.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pahlam - fruitfulness, benefit&lt;/strong&gt;. Nobody gives importance to what is fruitless.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;arhtavAda - stuttih, stotram. Glorification.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upapatti  - reason, logic.&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever is not logical, reasonable, rational cannot be the central theme.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shad lingaih tatparya niryayah mimamsa (analysis). &lt;strong&gt;From sutra 5 to 134 Vyasa uses shad lingas to prove that brahman alone is the central theme.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lingam - indicator, mark, clue, proof, sign.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard example for study is 6th chapter of chandogya: tat tvam asi prakaranam:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;upakrama upasamharau: confirmed, beginning and end speak about brahman. Example: TV news having highlights in the beginning and main points in the end.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;abhyasa: over the 6th chapter 9 times “tat tvam asi” gets repeated.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;apUrvata: new is pramanantara avedyam - not known through any other pramanam, instrument of knowledge. &lt;strong&gt;Even karma khandam does not reveal brahman, it reveals karma&lt;/strong&gt; (surprise suprise).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;apUrvata: I need not come and teach you what you already know. Chandogya example: salt in water. It is pervaded by something other than water which is not perceptible. The extra something makes the water salty, the extra something makes the body alive and sentient. &lt;strong&gt;Brahman is the salt of life.&lt;/strong&gt; Further:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Brahman is the unique prameyam for vedanta. Vedanta is the unique pramanam for brahman. Therefore they are made for each other. 4th sutra established the 3rd sutra.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;phalam: we find “brahmavit apnoti param”.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;arthavAdah: glorification by “eka vijnanena sarva vijnanam bhavati”. Kathopanishad: one who is in duality will travel from death to death. One who dies without getting brahmajnanam is an unfortunate person. Whereas one who dies after brahmajnanam he alone is brahmanah. &lt;strong&gt;Brahmastutti is also arthavAda, anyaninda is also arthavada&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;upapatti: Upanishad wants to show that it is not illogical, not dogmatic, not blind belief. It has got the support of the logic also. &lt;strong&gt;Upanishad: brahma satyam jagat mithya. Entire prapancha is a product and no product has an independent existence.&lt;/strong&gt; For mandah students: vacarambhanam vikaro nama dheyam mrtikA eva satyam. For a pot clay alone is satyam. Pot is mere nama rupa.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, Vedanta is pramanam for brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analysis of the most important word of the sutra: &lt;strong&gt;tu - alone&lt;/strong&gt; (in this context).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avadhAranam - emphasis. &lt;strong&gt;Any time you emphasize you are indirectly negating.&lt;/strong&gt; Every emphasis involves negation - vyAvRttiA. &lt;strong&gt;Shankaracarya: by using the word “tu” Vyasa is negating all other interpretations, all other purvapakshis, who claim that the subject matter is not brahman but something else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are six astika darshanam. Thus there are five purva paksas, we reduce them to three:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sankhya - yoga:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;have common philosophy, are practically the same&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;yoga concentrates on practice: discipline of ashtanga yoga&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;sankhya concentrates on theory&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;nyaya - vaysheshika: again, are essentially the same.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;purva mimamsa:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;analysed by Jaimini maharshi who was disciple of Vyasa.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;rituals, useful for material benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Useful for gaining chitta-suddhi. That’s why it’s called dharma sastram. Thus not really a purva paksha. But we emphasize that purva mimamsa cannot give moksha.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Famous commentary by Shabara - Shabara bashyam - where he admits it cannot give moksha. Later commentaries changed this into only purva mimamsa can give moksha. Then later to “vedanta is useless”.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vyasa looks at sankhya yoga as the most powerful purvapaksha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest of 1st chapter, sutra no. 5 to 134 is a commentary on “tu”. Even in the 2nd chapter he goes on refuting sankhya. Vyasya look at nyaya - vaisheshika as weak opponent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-27--14843&quot;&gt;Class 27 / 14843&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4th word need to be supplied for completion of 4th sutra: sastrayoni. Full reading: &lt;strong&gt;tat tu sastrayonit samanvayat&lt;/strong&gt; - that brahman is subject matter of vedanta because it has got importance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vishistaadvaitam and dvaitam are two commentaries on BS, they cannot become purva paksha&lt;/strong&gt;. Vishishtaadvaita, dvaita and advaita are “children” of Vyasa. All three are one and the same Vedanta darshanam only, all three are Vedantins. Dispute among these three is an internal dispute - yAdavIya kalaham.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankaracarya deals with nyaya - vaisheshika reasonable elaborately in 2nd chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main source of purva mimamsa sastram are the sutras of Jamini. Famous Shaabara bashyam is accepted and quoted by Shankara. Both are seen as complimentary to Vedanta, because dharma alone gives sadhana catustaya sampatti.&lt;/strong&gt; Purva mimamsa became purva paksha only with commentaries to Shaabara bashyam by Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhakarah. Thus we’ve got two types of purva mimamsa bhAtta mimamsa and prAbhatara mimamsa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BS classes are not compulsory for all. Those who want to know more about the purva paksha and those who want to know how vedanta refutes they alone need to come to BS. Otherwise Gita and Upanishads are more than sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Common views to both bhAtta matam and prabhatara matam:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All the vedic statements can be broadly classified into two: a) siddha bodhaka vakyani - statements of facts. b) karya bodhaka vakyani - statements of commandments. Statements of facts will give knowledge alone. Statements of action (commandments) will lead to action.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;siddha bhodaka vakyani do not give any benefit to us. Jnanam does not help us to accomplish anything. &lt;strong&gt;Knowing itself is not an accomplishment, thus jnanam is useless&lt;/strong&gt;. If I know there is a heaven, I only feel more miserable. Purusharta is either sukha prapti or dukha nivrtti, jnanam does not give any benefit. Karya bodhana vakyani gets you to do something and only by that we get some purusharta or the other. &lt;strong&gt;Let any amount of vedantic study take place, students always ask the question: Swamiji what should I do hereafter? Swamiji give me a practical lifestyle, so that I can do. Give me a daily routine. Every student asks for doing something because he feels he’s not benefited from the study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;PM (purva mimamsaka) agree that Veda is a pramanam. If bauddhas are driven out of India, the credit goes to PM. &lt;strong&gt;pramanam - anadhigata (unrevealed) abhAdita (unnegated) artha bhodakam (revelear)&lt;/strong&gt;:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;If Veda reveals whatever is revealed by science then Veda becomes apramanam. &lt;strong&gt;To enjoy the status of pramanam it has to reveal something which is beyond the scope of science, logic and all the sense organs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;abhAditam: something not contradicted by other pramanam. It should not contradict logic neither. It should be something &lt;strong&gt;beyond logic, yet not illogical. It should not contradict science, senses, anything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PM adds one more condition, which is not used but is accepted by Vedantis: phalavat - useful.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus for PM siddha bodhaka vakyani are not pramanams for PM because they don’t fulfill the 3rd condition (utility). This idea based on a jaimini sutra: AmnAyasya (vedah) kriyArthatvad (statements of injunctions being important) Anarthakyam (invalid) atadarthAnAm (siddha bhodkAnam).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-28--14844&quot;&gt;Class 28 / 14844&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahman is the subject matter of Vedanta. Anybody against this view is “purva pakshi”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the siddha bodhaka vakyani give us knowledge of facts. Purva pakshi: Any knowledge of facts does not give me any benefit - kevala jnanam nishprayojanam. Knowing that there is a ritual will not get me anywhere, the performance of the ritual will take me anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purva pakshi: pramanam is a pramanam only when it reveals something useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What benefit do I get by knowing brahman is satyam jnanam anantam? That the five elements where created? That there are panca koshas in me? &lt;strong&gt;Purva pakshi: vedosharah vedanta - it is like a barren land in a country. Entire veda (karma khanda and upasana khanda) is a greenery.&lt;/strong&gt; usharah - desert.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purva pakshi: all siddha bodhaka vakyani are termed artha vada (eulogy -&amp;gt; useless)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We accept God as the revealer of Vedas whereas PM does not. For PM Vedah enjoys the status of God. How came Veda? It is anadi. Therefore he accepts it as pramanam. For him siddha bodhaka part of Vedah has become apramanam. If you are accepting whole vedah as pramanam, how can you reject a part of it as apramanam? PM’s answer: they are directly not useful. All the siddha bodhaka vakyams will help in the implementation of karya bodhaka vakyams:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vayu devata is a great devata because he does everything quickly - siddha bodhaka vakyam (sheshi). One should do the ritual offering oblations to the vayu devata - karya bodhaka vakyam (sheshi).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shesha-sheshi sambadhah.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Therefore any vedantic statement will be independently useless, we should link it to karya bodhaka vakyam. Therefore vedanta should be put into practice - applied vedanta (PMs idea).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: there is no such thing called brahman at all, it is only a bhrama. Therefore according to PM brahma nasti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upanishad very clearly says brahman is not attainable nor knowable&lt;/strong&gt; - adreshyam (not perceivable, not known), agrAhyam (cannot be grasped). PM: therefore brahman is not directly a purusharta because it is not attainable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can I use Brahman as instrument? No, brahman is avyavaharyam - not available for any TX. It is neither means nor end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since I’m already known, why should veda reveal something that is already evident? Whenever atma is talked about in vedanta, you should take it as encouraging statement. Glorification of yajamana.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up to here the two PM mattams agree.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Baastha matam: all the jnana khandam vakyams should be connected to karma khanda ritual vakyams.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prabhakarah: there are so many siddha vakyas and so many karya vakyas. You cannot just connect any. Any siddha vakyam should be connected to the nearest karya vakyam. In the jnanakandha itself there are many upasana vakyams. Upasana are also karya bodhaka vakyams - manasa karma. Thus rather connect the siddha vakyams of the jnanakandha to upasana vakyams existing within jnana kandha itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore “aham brahman asmi” you have to repeat all over, practice as auto-suggestion, conditioning - as upasana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-29--14845&quot;&gt;Class 29 / 14845&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: brahman is nonexistent because it is utterly useless. It is neither a goal nor a means. All Vedanta vakyams are siddha bodhaka vakyams, statement of facts with no benefit, and are to be converted into karya bodhaka vakyam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: After studying Vedanta one feels very nice, one feels light. With that light mood one should do karma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: Aham brahma asmi is not a fact because brahman does not exist. Upasana is defined as seeing something upon something else. Final result: no use in jnanam, you have to do something. Either you have to do karma or upasana, action is the result of the Vedah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: what you say is perfectly valid, but there are many exceptions to the rule. Normally we find that knowledge does not give me any benefit. Yogaasana knowledge will not give me any benefit, I should implement that knowledge. Yet there are several cases where kevala jnanam gives benefit:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wherever there is a problem caused by ignorance in that case mere knowledge alone can solve the problem&lt;/strong&gt;. Yatra yatra ajnanat dukham va karyam va bhavati tatra tatra janat prayojanam bhavati.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Therefore siddha bodhaka vakyams produce knowledge which will give purusharta often. Where they don’t give prayojanam, in all such cases you have to join them karya bodhaka vakyam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All Vedanta vakyams come under this exceptional case.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vedanta itself makes it very clear. &lt;strong&gt;jnana matrena moksha bhavati.&lt;/strong&gt; Example Isavasya: yasmin sarvani bhutami atmaiva-bhud vijanatah, tatra ko mohah kah shoka ekatva-manu-pasyatah - when, to the knower, all beings have become one in his own self, how shall he feel deluded thereafter? What grief can there be to him who sees oneness everywhere? Chandogya: tarati shokam atmavid.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: after studying vedanta we have to use that knowledge to perform action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankaracarya:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedanta jnanam cannot be connected to karma/upasana khanda.&lt;/strong&gt; Previous point: need not be connected.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedanta jnanam eliminates duality which is the basis for karma and upasana.&lt;/strong&gt; All vaidika karmas require two basic qualifications: aham karta and varna ashrama status (king, brahmana, etc.) and duality. Vedanta negates these, so how can it be combined with karma and upasana?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedanta positively condemns karma and upasana as bandha hetuh.&lt;/strong&gt; After vedanta jnanam a person will lose purushartatva buddhi in karma/upasana.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If brahman is neither sadhyam nor sadhanam,&lt;/strong&gt; it means brahman is something different from your goal and your means. &lt;strong&gt;It is the very sadhaka. By negating the sadhyam/sadhanam status the upanishad says you the sadhaka are brahman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;John: In my family, there are three persons. One is my wife, another is my child. Who is the third one? PM: Father? John: I’m the third one! PM: OK, this is important. PM repeats the same question to Shankara. Shankara: you are the third person. PM: no, it is John!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankaracarya: &lt;strong&gt;Atma is well known as jivatma but not clearly understood as paramatma. Thus Vedah has to reveal atma as paramatma.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-30--14846&quot;&gt;Class 30 / 14846&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karma sambandha is not required, not intended, not possible. Three reasons:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vedanta is capable of giving the benefit by itself. Knowledge gives us the benefit even without connecting to any action. Sruti very clearly says the same.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If Vedanta expects us to do some karma for usefulness of jnanam, Vedanta would glorify karma. But throughout Vedanta karma is criticised and condemned. There is no intention of karma sambandha.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vedanta negates all the conditions for karma.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: brahman is non-existent as it is neither means nor end. Vedantin: No doubt, neither means nor end - it is the sadhaka - you / I myself. &lt;strong&gt;To say “brahman is nonexistent” is to say “I’m nonexistent” which is a contradiction because I have to be existent to say it.&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody can negate the existence brahman because it is the very negator itself. &lt;strong&gt;Not only that he’s existent he’s useful also, because when I know I’m brahman that brahmajnanam negates my jivatvam status.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: if brahman is self-evident why should Vedanta come and comment on what is already evident to me? Pramanam is meant to reveal something not known. Vedantin: even though atma is evident, it is not fully known - misunderstood as jivaatma. I know my sat chit rupam, I don’t know ananda svarupam. Vedanta is not required to give samanya (normal) jnanam, is is required to give vishesha (special) jnanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedantin: final offensive argument. It is the other way around. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, karma kandam is apramanam&lt;/strong&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Does it reveal something new? Punyam, papam, svarga loka … yes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is it saprayojanam? Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is it not negated by any other pramanam? &lt;strong&gt;Karma kandham is negated by jnana kandam.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no plurality at all. &lt;strong&gt;What you call plurality is nothing but brahman&lt;/strong&gt;. ajnana kale dvaitam, jnana kale advaitam. &lt;strong&gt;Karma kandha reveals invalid duality, which obtains at the time of ignorance, therefore it is apramanam.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus jnana kandha is flower, karma kandha is thread and has to be associated with jnanakandam.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a means to come to jnana kandham karma kandham is useful. Sadhana catustaya sampatti pradhanena.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedantin: karma kandha is not meant for dharma artha kama purusharta. We don’t consider them as purushartas at all. They are only exalted samsara.&lt;/strong&gt; Example: A-class prison. We only tempt other people by saying it is purusharta. &lt;strong&gt;Karma kandha incl. upasana kandha is only to get vairagyam.&lt;/strong&gt; Having got enough kicks in life one will get vairagyam. &lt;strong&gt;Sugarcoating for the very bitter vairagyam pill.&lt;/strong&gt; The idea is go there, get whipped left and right so you feel like running away. If you do, it has worked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore the first sutra is atah. Vairagya siddhi anantaram, atah brahma jijnasa. Mundaka: pariksya lokan karmacitan … &lt;strong&gt;Everything other than moksha is maha-samsara.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t have vairagyam, tablet dosage is not enough. Therefore increase the dosage of karma kandha and continue the medicine. Brhadaranyaka 4 - 4 - 22: entire karma kandha is to get interest in Vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest in Vedanta is directly proportionate to vayragyam towards samsara.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jnana kandha is impossible without karma kandha, karma kandha is incomplete without jnana kandha.&lt;/strong&gt; Ritualist will easily understand Vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara matam is very close to PM. Vrttih - small commentary, like notes. Vrttikara - commentator. Vrttikara matam - the philosophy of one of the brahmasutra commentators. Shankara was not first commentator of BS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-31--14847&quot;&gt;Class 31 / 14847&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Word “tu” - negation of all purva pakshas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttihkara (real name is unknown) differs from PM by saying that brahman is existent. He says, brahman is revealed by the upanishad. Yet he joins PM and says that mere brahma jnanam cannot give moksha. He says that after gaining brahma jnana one has to do brahma upasanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: after learning we have to meditate upon that Brahman and through constant meditation we acquire enormous punyam and as a result of this one will attain moksha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every word indicating jnanam has the meaning of upasanam also. The word Vedah has got two meanings. One is jnanam, another is upasanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vedantin: exception - problem of ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: wherever the word jnanam comes, you’ve to translate as upasanam. Don’t take brahmajnanam under the category of exception, it comes under the regular rule kevala jnanena prajoyanam nasti. Look at all the vedantins who are academics but not muktas. From all these experiences it is very clear that brahmajnanam does not transform. Srutabrahmanah yatha purvam samsaritva darshat - samsara continues in those people who have learned Vedanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also, if brahmajnanam gives moksha upanishad should stop with shrotavyah and mantavyah. Yet we find that upanishad clearly prescribes niddidhiasanam (repeated dhyanam) thereafter. And what is repeated dhyanam other than upasanam?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sanskrit grammar: tavya suffix indicates a compulsory action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaudapada: &lt;strong&gt;every upasaka is an unfortunate one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re not criticising upasana totally. We’re criticising upasana presented as a means of moksa, which comes after brahma jnanam. Yet we glorify upasanam before brahma jnanam as a means of mental refinement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ashariratahi moksah - &lt;strong&gt;moksha is freedom from sharira sambandah&lt;/strong&gt;. Samsara is sashariratahi samsara.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As long as sharira sambadah is there, sukha dukha opposites cannot be avoided.&lt;/strong&gt; Even when priyam comes, we will not be very happy, because we have to worry that the priyam will go away. &lt;strong&gt;When apriyam comes, we’re worried. When priyam comes we’re worried about drsthi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upasana - manasa karma. Where ever action is there, there will be tAratamyam - gradation. Qualitative and quantitative difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Punya can only give different types of body depending on the type of punya. &lt;strong&gt;Punya can only improve your sashariratvam, it can never make you asharira.&lt;/strong&gt; It can give exalted or inferior shariram. &lt;strong&gt;Therefore any amount of karma and upasana will keep you only in sashariratvam, where gradation, priya/apriya cannot be avoided. Four things are synonymous: karma, punyam, sashariratvam and samsarah&lt;/strong&gt;. If you define moksha as upasana phalam then moksha will also involve punyam, sashariratvam -&amp;gt; will be within samsara only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;na tu karmana na tu upasanena jnana matrena moskah&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: why can’t you say ashariratvam comes because of brahma upasana? Shankara: no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-32--14848&quot;&gt;Class 32 / 14848&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: other upasanas will give you better sashariratvam, brahma upasana will give you ashariratvam. Shankara: &lt;strong&gt;ashariratvam cannot be the result of any karma / upasana. ashariratvam is the very nature of atma.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature: whatever is the nature of a thing is always there.&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever is intrinsic in a thing is always there. If heat is the nature of fire fire is eternally hot. &lt;strong&gt;Any karma/upasana phalam is not available now but only later after the practice.&lt;/strong&gt; Karmaphalam = sadhyam = something to be acquired in future. Asharita = nithya siddham. How can they be equated? &lt;strong&gt;Ashariratvam is not a goal to be accomplished but a fact to be recognised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kAjam - shariram.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purva pakshi: if advaitin defines ashariratvam as moksha he can never have jivanmukti because in jivanmukti he is sasharira.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: jivanmukti is possible when we say moksha is ashariratvam. Jivanmukta is asharira. If others think he’s sasharira, it is others’ problem, not his.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no time when atma is sashariram. It is ashariram all the time:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is the very nature of myself.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Atmanah asangatvat. It cannot have any relationship with anything. Akashavat - like &lt;strong&gt;space, which is along with every object but not connected to any.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Atmanah nitya akartrtvat. Sharira sambandah comes because of karmaphala. Karmaphala comes for a karta. Atma is nitya akarta.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atma cannot become sasharirah, but it is mistaken as sasharirah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jnani never claims the pleasures and pains as his.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd definition of moksha: brahma bavah hi mokshah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From scriptures we come to know &lt;strong&gt;there is only one nitya vastu - brahman. Moksha is nityah, brahman is nityah.&lt;/strong&gt; There is only one nitya thing -&amp;gt; mokshah prapti = brahman prapti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any karma or upasana can produce only four types of karmaphalam:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Apti - reaching (travel). Impossible for brahman: sarvagatatvA. All-pervasiveness and travel are contradiction.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;utpatih - production. Brahman is nitya -&amp;gt; no question of production.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;vikara - change, conversion, modification. Can jivatma gradually modify into brahman? Brahman is not the end product of a process because brahmanah avikaryatvat.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;samskarah - purification. Brahmanah nitya suddhatvAt - there is no question of removal of impurities (shuddha - pure, absolute).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-33--14849&quot;&gt;Class 33 / 14849&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If moksah is the result of any action, it will certainly have a beginning. Because any result has a beginning, because the result is accomplished by following a sadhana. And whatever has a beginning will certainly have an end. Therefore upasana phala rupa moksha will be anitya moksah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All philosophers commonly agree that moksah has to be nitya.&lt;/strong&gt; The very purpose of moksha shastra is to go out of samsara represented by mortality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chandogya 8 - 2 - 1: whatever is acquired through karma is destroyed here, whatever is acquired through punya in the other loka, that is also anitya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nitya moksha upasana phalam bhavitum na arhati. Upasana phalasya anityatvat. &lt;strong&gt;Phalam - phalgutaya lIyate - that which becomes rotten and gets destroyed in time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upasana cannot be the theme of Vedanta. Analysis of shad lingani proved that &lt;strong&gt;Vedanta talks about owning up a moksha which is here and now. Vedanta doesn’t talk about accomplishing something new in future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mahavakya “tat tvam asi” clearly shows by using present tense that moksha is here and now. If it is not here and now, it can never be anywhere at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brhadaranyaka: by putra get manushya loka again, by karma get pitru loka (svargA), by upasana get deva loka. Sanyasi doesn’t want neither. He seeks moksha. Having renounced upasana phalam and going in search of moksha, moksha cannot commander upasana phalam. Therefore vedanta doesn’t deal with karma phalam, does not deal with upasana phalam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: All the karmas and upasanas should be analyzed in the veda purva or veda anta? All karmas and upasanas should be analyzed in the veda purva, because both produce dharma or punyam and therefore everything connected with dharma should be analysed in the purva bhaga. If vedanta deals also with upasana it should be part of purva bhaga, not a separate shastram.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedanta has nothing to do with dharma. Vedata deals with an atma which is anyatra dharmAt, anyatra adharmAt, anyatra asmAt krtAkrtAt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brahma upasana itself is not possible. &lt;strong&gt;Brahma is not available for upasana. Upanishad clearly says you yourself is brahman, which means brahman is not an object at all. It is the very nature of the upasaka.&lt;/strong&gt; How can the upasaka brahman become upasya brahman? &lt;strong&gt;Subject can never be the object. Subject is eternally the subject. Object is eternally the object. They cannot be interchanged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is illogical to talk of upasana of brahman. Student asks for brahman, the teacher very clearly says: &lt;strong&gt;whatever you meditate upon is not brahman&lt;/strong&gt; (Kena 1 - 4, 7).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: if brahma upasanam is not possible because brahman is not an object then brahma jnanam is also not possible because it would make brahman an object of knowledge. Thus sastram cannot be pramanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: yes, &lt;strong&gt;brahma jnanam is not possible. In fact brahma jnanam is not required.&lt;/strong&gt; In the form of consciousness brahman is all the time evident. Nothing need reveal consciousness because consciousness reveals everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So why to go to guru if I’m is self-evident? &lt;strong&gt;Our problem is not knowing brahman or atman, our problem is the misconception of atman which requires a correction.&lt;/strong&gt; The self-evident I is mistaken.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two things are evident when I say I: I the self-evident consciousness and then the body mind complex evident because of the consciousness. When two things are shining very intimately, the properties of the body I’m throwing upon the consciousnesses out of sheer ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sastram is required not to reveal brahman, it is required to remove the superimposed limitations. This is in the form of a vrtti (thought) in the mind: aham brahma asmi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropping the limitations is an intellectual process which is called atmajnanam&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m not seeing, experiencing anything new, &lt;strong&gt;I’m only dropping something. I’m not acquiring anything now.&lt;/strong&gt; Such an atmajnanam can come only through sastram, therefore sastram is pramanam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-34--14850&quot;&gt;Class 34 / 14850&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: jnanam should be followed by action to be useful. Shankara: Nisheda (dont’s) vakyams are as valid vidhi (do’s) vakyam. What action is involved in nisheda vakyams?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: if brahma jnanam gives moksha, all students should be mukti purushas. But when we ask them, they always start with “but, if, …”. Therefore sravanam is important, but thereafter upasana has to be done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: &lt;strong&gt;I never says a listener of Vedanta will be free. We say “a knower of Vedanta is definitively free”.&lt;/strong&gt; One who has understood Vedanta:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I’m free: eternal fact vs. information.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Birthless, ashariri, ajaha vs. upanishad saying I’m birthless.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Point blank answers vs. doubt. If I know I’m atma and atma is always free where is the question of doubt?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listeners are many, knowers are few. &lt;strong&gt;Knower is one for whom “I’m free” is a fact. Listener is one for whom “I’m free” is information contained in the upanishad.&lt;/strong&gt; Samsaris can be listeners but they cannot be knowers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jnanam and bandha (samsara) never go together&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore after jnanam no upasana is required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PM: Why should Vedanta presribe niddidhiasanam after study?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: &lt;strong&gt;sravana, manana, niddidhiasanam are not practiced after jnanam. They are practiced for jnanam.&lt;/strong&gt; Sravanam is the main sadhana which gives jnanam. As long as there are obstacles obstructing the jnanam for giving moksha, jnanam won’t do its job. Obstacle 1) doubt to jnanam giving moksha phalam 2) viparita bhavana - habitual notion that atma is something else inside me and I’m somebody else. Saying “I’m brahman” and complaining about problems at anatma level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saprathibandhaka jnanam is as “good” as ajnanam. It is not ajnanam, but as bad as ajnanam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mananam removes the doubt. Nididhyasanam removes the habitual notion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doubt-free knowledge means four things:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;what is right I should know as right&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;what is wrong I should know as wrong&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;why right is right (logically establish that)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;why wrong is wrong&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respecting a person is one thing. It is the duty of a gentleman. Accepting everything is the sign of a confused man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nididhyasanam: Changing the thought-process. Reorientation of the way of thinking. Nididhyasanam does not give jnanam, does not give moksha, it removes the obstacle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Light can remove the darkness all the time. If there are obstacles, you’ve to remove them as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After knowledge what should you do? Nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;class-35--14851&quot;&gt;Class 35 / 14851&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nididhyasanam is not an upasanam after jnanam. Nididhyasanam is also part of the process of jnanam only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Vrttikara upasana is a karma that comes after jnanam. Whereas in Vedanta niddidhyasanam is not a karma after jnanam, it is also a process of jnanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upasana being karma produces punyam. Nididhyasanam doesn’t produce punyam, which is adrstham, it only removes our habbitual dehatma buddhi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In upasana (in vrttikara matam) one expects moksha to happen in future. In Vedanta nididhyasanam is knocking of the expectation of moksha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sravanam, mananam, nididhyasanam all put together give knowledge. Sravanam has a positive role of producing knowledge, mananam has negative role of removing doubt. Nididhyasa have negative role of removing samsaric habits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karma belongs to veda purva. In jnana kanda there is no question of karma. Upasana comes under mental karma only. Vedanta sastra only gives jnanam, it doesn’t have an iota of karma.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vrttikara: isn’t jnanam also only a type of karma? It is in the form of mental vrtti just like upasana.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shankara: jnanam does not come under karma. Upasana comes under karma. &lt;strong&gt;Jnanam depends on the object of knowledge, vastu tantram. Karma depends on the subject of action, it is kartr tantram.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The moment you become hearer, what you hear is not under your control. It depends on the object of hearer. Vrtti depends on what the speaker says. The moment you become a writer what you write depends on the subject.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jnanam is dependent on the type of pramanam you use. It is pramana tantram. Whereas karma, esp. sastric karma, is dependent codana tantram karma. As a pramata what type of world I should experience will depend upon the type of pramanam that I operate. Whereas karma is codana tantram. The sastra will determine the type of karma/upasana I do. Chandogya panca agni vidya: I choose to see female and male as agni. When I see man as man is it because of sastra vidhi? It is not codana tantram. Seeing man as fire is codana tantram. Seeing man as man is knowledge, seeing man as fire is upasana. Seeing stone as vishnu is upasanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karma can produce four types of result: reaching, production, modification or purification. Whereas &lt;strong&gt;jnanam does not produce any one of the four results. It only reveals a thing as it is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose you come back after one month. You get the knowledge of dirty room. Knowledge will never purify the room. Jnanam cannot do any kind of purification, if you want to purify the mind - you need to do karma. Self-knowledge doesn’t produce anything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jnanam doesn’t produce moksha, does not modify, purify nor reach anything. Jnanam reveals a fact that I’ve been always free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before jnanam karma and upasana are required. They are not useful during nor after jnanam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical format sutra no. 4:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;viSayah: vedanta sastram&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;vizayah: whether it is karma param or brahma param. Whether is it with some action to be done or just revealing brahman.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;siddhanta: vedanta sastram brahma param. &lt;strong&gt;Vedanta doesn’t enjoin any action, it wants you to understand something.&lt;/strong&gt; It is just a matter of recognition, clear understanding. If you have purification and concentration &lt;strong&gt;once you come to Vedanta you have nothing to do, you have something to know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sangatih: akshepa (objection) sangatih - 4th adhikaranam is an answers to the objection given for the 3rd adhikaranam.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
